And I was being a perfect gentleman,  only asking questions honourably and honestly wanting answers to questions like  \"Am I obligated by law to sign this document?\"  \"By who's authority?\" and that's all it took for her to mention \"negligence\" on my part and \"child family services\" so I'm kind of pissed off that my concern has brought her to the brink of informing authorities. \n\nSO I also REFUSED the screening process where they poke a hole in my property and take blood samples for supposed screening,  and the doctor said he might have to contact child family services because it is neglect to place my child in potential danger...   I asked him to advise me on the correct course of action based on his professional opinion so I'm not neglecting anything. Also I asked if I had a right to refuse the screening and he claimed he'd NEVER HAD ANYONE REFUSE BEFORE ME and I asked him to make sure I had no right to refuse...  He came back with a pamphlet and a print out detailing my RIGHT TO REFUSE SCREENING.  \n\nWhat an ordeal this is.  I'm still unsure of what to do here.

Every person has the right to the protection of law against abusive attacks on his honor, reputation and private or family life.\n\nSection 9. Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use except upon payment of just compensation and in the manner provided by law. \n\nSection 12. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist except in the latter case as a punishment for crime after the accused has been duly convicted.\n\nSection 19. The foregoing enumeration of rights shall not be construed restrictively nor does it contemplate the exclusion of other rights not specifically mentioned which belong to the people in a democracy (Like the RIGHT TO THE SECURITY OF THE PERSON). The power of the Legislative Assembly to enact laws for the protection of the life, health and general welfare of the people shall likewise not be construed restrictively.\n\nSection 20. The Commonwealth also recognizes the existence of the following human rights:\n\nThe right of every person to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, and especially to food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services.>>\n\nPlease don't post/comment here until I place all scanned notices here.
