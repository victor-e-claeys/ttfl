Released on Personal Recognizance means one signed a BAIL BOND as SURETY. That is all!!! They don't just let you go because you said so, you HAVE to sign it.\n\nCeit Butler: Look, signing is NOT a problem if you know HOW to sign. I got out on bail in my case. Guess who told me how to sign? Dean Clifford. Sign: By:____________ RESTRICTED SIGNATURE, RESTRICTED CAPACITY\n\nAnd draw a box around the entire thing...that REMOVES it from the document. (You know, I'm PRETTY sure I already said this.)\n\nCeit Butler: As for your \"magic document\"....the Notice of Mistake is the closest you'll find, for IN court. But ONLY if you all start fucking using it properly! It's NOT just a document.\n\nIf at ANY time while you're speaking, you feel you've stepped into their jurisdiction by accepting SURETY, you throw out a VERBAL Notice of Mistake: \"If I have led this court to believe that I am a paryt with SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. and please forgive me\".\n\nAnd responding to \"You\" is the biggest one. Let them know right from the start that as the Sole Beneficiary of the BIRTH CERTIFICATE BOND, you wish to solely be addressed as \"insert regular old first name here\". And ANYONE who doesn't address you by THAT NAME ONLY, EVERY time that they speak to you, you respond \"Are you addressing me? As the SOLE BENEFICIARY, I wish to solely be addressed as:___\"\n\nCeit Butler: Say it as MANY times as you like. (and any time that they RECESS, that resets everything so IMMEDIATELY repeat everything again when they come back!)\n\nMake sure the verbal Notice of Mistake is the very LAST thing that you say before they finish up, so it's the LAST THING on the record and wipes clean any SURETY that may have you accidentally fumbled into.\n\nCeit Butler: Sign the RIGHT way at your bail hearing and get the fuck out so that you're actually able to handle things properly.\n\nTake the disclosure, read all the LOVELY things that it states on the front, that you are agreeing to by accepting these documents.\n\nSTAPLE (so it becomes part of the document and cannot be removed) a Notice of Mistake, neatly, onto the top of the front page and MAIL THAT FUCKER BACK, as declined. \n\nCeit Butler: Then you work on your first document. Notice of Questions for the Court.\n\nAddress every question that you need answered in order to UNDERSTAND the NATURE and CAUSE of these PROCEEDINGS. Also include your Affidavit of Status with this document.\n\nHave everything nicely organized with tabs seperating each document, a cover and spiral-bound at your local copy place.\n\nIt's a LEGAL DOCUMENT...so make it fucking look like one. You don't want to be treated like a joke in court? Then don't give them ANY excuse to.\n\nInclude the Notice of Mistake in a tab marked EXHIBIT #1 in the back. It has already been submitted when you sent the DISCLOSURE back by REGISTERED MAIL (with NO return address!). Give them 10 days to respond, have your documents NOTARIZED and mail it in.\n\nCeit Butler: When the 10 days expire, you send them a CERTIFICATE of NON RESPONSE and OPPORTUNITY to CURE. Give them 5 ADDITIONAL days to settle this HONOURABLY. This way THEY are the ones creating CONTROVERSY.\n\nCeit Butler: Include ALL previously submitted documents thus far, in new tabs in the back. These (are) PROOF now.\n\nCeit Butler: When the 5 days expire, you send them a NOTICE of DEFAULT.\n\nAgain, everything professionally spiral-bound, tabs, covers, and type it out in the correct format. Look at samples of legal documents, pay attention to how they are laid out.\n\nEverybody clear now?!\n\nCeit Butler: And make sure every new document states that UNLESS these questions are answered, you cannot UNDERSTAND the NATURE and CAUSE of these PROCEEDINGS.\n\nCeit Butler: Perhaps you missed this part:\n\n\"You don't want to be treated like a joke in court? Then don't give them ANY excuse to.\"\n\nChris Evan: \"These PROOF now\" Ceit, what exactly do you mean by this sentence? Just that the Exhibits are now proof?\n\nCeit Butler: You've mailed them to the COURT CLERK, by REGISTERED MAIL, (oh, sorry, and include copies of your postal receipts with the signature of the party who accepted them) and they are UNREBUTTED.\n\nCeit Butler: Other than filling up the thread with useless bullshit, destracting from the ACTUAL CONTENT, and making sure that anyone new who may be browsing will immediately dismiss the thread?\n\nBecause that's the only possible \"point\" that I can see. (She WASNT speaking to Chris Evan here)\n\nChris Evan: Ok...thanks. And we are Noticing the Court Clerk and NOT the Prosecuting Attorney, is this correct?\n\nCeit Butler: Send it the CLERK. And make sure each document also states that if the QUESTIONS are not answered, then it is you WISH/REQUIRE and DEMAND that this matter be DISCHARGED.\n\nCeit Butler: How about restricting the Grade-School BULLSHIT to personal chats?\n\nI was mistakenly under the impression that you all wanted to learn something.\n\nI am going over the steps from my case with you because I thought you were finally at levels of understanding that would allow you to grasp this.\n(Posting every back in July would have been like handing a loaded shotgun to a 2 year old.)\nAgain, clearly mistaken.\n\nChris Evan: Out of curiosity, why wouldn't we send it to our adversary...the person bringing the charges?\n\nCeit Butler: You send it to the CLERK...the person in charge of the court file and the PUBLIC RECORD. Send a copy to the CROWN ATTORNEY as well, if you like. I had additional copies with me when I went to court. That way, if they tried to claim they had not received them, I could KINDLY provide them with one. (Aren't I nice? )\n\nCeit Butler: I also submitted a notorazied, colour copies, (front and back) of my BIRTH CERTIFICATE with the first document and had extra copies when I went to court.\n\nCeit Butler: If you act in HONOUR the entire time, then the COURT is the only one creating CONTROVERSY.\n\nEamonn O Brien: Rather than shouting about how one is a man... \n\nCeit Butler: That's why ANY error, such as the COURT presuming that YOU are the PARTY with SURETY, you CLEARLY accept as being your fault and you ASK FORGIVENESS....because they HAVE to grant it. \n\nCeit Butler: \"If have led this COURT to believe that I am a PARTY with SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE, and please FORGIVE me\".\n\nCeit Butler: It's not \"THEIR fault\" that you forgot to mention that you weren't the LEGAL PERSON, they're simply operating on presumptions. The burden of correcting that error lies on you.\n\nThat's how you have to treat it.\n\nCeit Butler: It is the CLERK's responsibility to enter all DOCUMENTS into the file. That's why you send it there.\n\nCeit Butler: Yes. Now, I went to my first appearance, stated my status as the SOLE BENEFICIARY and that I wish to be solely addressed as KATHRYN.\n\nThe JUSTICE did that, no arguement, which means he just ACQUIESCED and TACITLY AGREED that I am in FACT the SOLE BENEFICIARY.\n\nI then ordered the TRANSCRIPT and attached it as an EXHIBIT in each proceeding document as PROOF.\n\nCeit Butler: The JUSTICE attempted to enter a plea for me, three times, to which I responded \"I DO NOT CONSENT.\"\nThey'll try to trick you, just stand your ground. Do not consent, and NOTICE of MISTAKE.\n\n(Make sure you KEEP all your ORIGINAL notarized documents. Send them colour copies.)\n\nCeit Butler: Correction, send everything to the PROSECUTOR's office. (Sorry guys, I'm rushing here)\n\nCeit Butler: No problem. Things are...strange...\n\nI wanted to get at least the bare-bone basics out there.\n\nLou Manotti: YOU all need to understand the power of an affidavit.\n\nEamonn O Brien: An unrebutted one at that Lou \n\nLou Manotti: An unrebutted affidavit stands as a PUBLIC RECORD as TRUTH in LAW and COMMERCE.\n\nRobert Cormier: Scott told me/us to study notaries.\n\nCeit Butler: Send them to both, CLERK and PROSECUTOR.\n\nCeit Butler: As a BONUS, we have an object lesson!\n\nEamonn O Brien, you just failed the SURETY TEST!\n\n\"Please don't let one member's comments deter you from sharing Ceit. It's MUCH appreciated...\"\n\nAt NO point did I mention YOUR name, you just responded to \"you\" and accepted SURETY.\n\nTry to get your mind into the habit of spotting that when it happens, and it will seve you well.\n\nCeit Butler: Send everything, notarized copies, by REGISTERED MAIL. No return address.\n\nDerek Moran: \"[YOU] all need to understand the power of an affidavit.\"\n\nDoes this have anything to do with THIS Maxim-of-law, Lou?\n\nQui non negat fatetur. A person who does not deny\nadmits.\n\np.s.\nyou saw what i did there, right? \n\nDerek Moran: somebody on Scott's boat was pointing-out this very Maxim to me in regards to Affidavits- oh thats right, he said exactly - \"He who does not deny, admits\"...did i mention i was reminded of this Maxim on Scott's BOAT? ;)\n\nDerek Moran: This just off Norah's page:\n\n\"Norah Holloway\nSomeone just got a call from Dean Clifford. He was brought before the Chief Justice Chartier first thing this morning! Dean dropped his two sentence A-bomb stopped them in their tracks!\n\nDerek Moran: Knowing Dean, \"his two sentence A-bomb\" probably included:\n\n\"I AM REQUIRED TO INFORM YOU THAT FORCED COMPLIANCE TO ORDERS BY YOURSELF, AND/OR YOUR AGENTS, IS IN FACT, ACCEPTANCE of my Terms and Conditions.\"\n\nSecond sentence = \"Fellas...you're gonna want that cowbell\"\n\nCeit Butler: Because, as Lou ALSO just said early, the power lies in the fact that :\" An unrebutted affidavit stands as a PUBLIC RECORD as TRUTH in LAW and COMMERCE.\"\n\nCeit Butler: Silence is aquiescence. If the court does NOT rebut any of the facts stated in your affidavit, then they have TACITLY AGREED with them.\n\nIf you DO end up in the courtroom, reading your Affidavit out loud gets it on the PUBLIC RECORD. State afterwards that \"For the record, the COURT has tacitly agreed that I <insert previous statements>\".\n\nPete Daoust: The truth of an affidavit jams their fucking lies \n\nDerek Moran: OOH- regarding Affidavits, on Scott's boat it was made CLEAR.....ONLY, send, the court, PHOTOCOPIES\n\nWE keep the ORIGINAL...the court gets a PHOTOCOPY.....has to do with COPYHOLD, you dont want the court getting their hands on the ORIGINAL...the AUTHOR is the AUTHORITY...so handing over the ORIGINAL to the court is BAD - would you concur, [Ill]Lou Manotti?\n\nLou Manotti: only send THEM photocopies of your documents (certification unnecessary).You retain ALL original documentation.

I know I am.\n\nI recall (hopefully correctly - i can't find the thread) Scott saying something to the effect that a corporation can appoint a notary if it does business between provinces. I haven't had much success figuring out how to get that title recognized, or exactly how I/we would go about establishing a notary public within a corporation. I do have some ideas, but, they are on shaky unsure ground.\n\nI am hoping that within this thread we can clear some, if not all of this up. \n\n******\n\nI have been researching (with my chimp brain) to figure some of this out.  This was interesting:\n\n\"Effective December 31, 2012, the Commissioners and Other Persons Who May Take Affidavits regulation will replace the current statutory designations of commissioners for taking affidavits by virtue of office. Commissioners by virtue of office may take affidavits without applying to the Ministry of the Attorney General for a commissioner appointment.\"\n\nHmmm. So if I have a \"COMMISSION by VIRTUE of OFFICE, I can \"take\" affidavits.\n\nThat lead me back to Black's Law Dictionary and it's definition of commission. The word reminds me of Scott and his navy and commissioning officers. Here's what Black's Law says about COMMISSION:\n\ncommission, n. (l4c) 1. A warrant or authority, from the government or a court, that empowers the person named to execute official acts <the student received his commission to the U.S. Navy after graduation>. 2. The authority under which a person transacts business for another <the client gave her attorney express commission to sign the contract>. 3.

He just tries to scare you with vague \"consequences\", but I've wrestled with Scientologists, so Dean's method of \"discrediting\" is amateur-night stuff. It is important to ME that you all have things clear in your heads though, so lets walk through the current fear-mongering, and clear up everything in one post (Efficiency)\n\nDean said:\n\n<blockquote>Again, Quote - Scott: \"Yet Dean Clifford squawks about them as if they are the ONLY ANSWER? REALLY?\"\n\nReally, so not only do I squawk, but I believe that motions are the ONLY answer? </blockquote> \n\nRead this paragraph. Phrased in the form of a question... Ok. I'll answer it! YES! That is ALL Dean talked about. I wasn't listening to a special version of the show where only I heard it. There is no OTHER answers, and you will note early on he says \"That's all I want to say about family law\". ALL he talked about was APPLICATIONS and MOTIONS, like appealing to your rapist is a GOOD idea, and ignoring that APPLICATIONS AND MOTIONS = CONSENT. Notice he did not even TOUCH on that issue. He just pretends it's irrelevant, and claims they \"work\".\n\n<blockquote>People who want to believe sensationalists, are welcome to it. I might also suggest you start watching Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, if you prefer sensationalism and preposterous claims. Of course, they cannot compare to Scott at this point, as he has that market locked down. </blockquote>\n\nNow I'm sensationalist. I make preposterous claims, OK, if anyone here thinks a claim I made is preposterous, please I REALLY want to prove otherwise. If I make a claim here, I am MORE than prepared to substantiate it. Otherwise this is just trying to vaguely discredit.\n\n<blockquote>Also, yes, motions have worked JUST fine in the past to shut court down. Again, people can believe what they want, I am not arguing. Choose your path, and enjoy. \n\nAlso, as for everyone else expecting an immediate reply to most of this absolute nonsense otherwise apparently the nonsense stands as truth, I have this to point out. </blockquote>\n\nWorked in the past... Entering their jurisdiction and Acting as a Party, has worked in the past... Seriously? THAT'S his rebuttal? What I say is NONSENSE, and MOTIONING and APPLYING is ok. REALLY?\n\nIf anything I say is nonsense, please, point out the part where I lost you. I don't speak Yiddish here.\n\n<blockquote>\nI WORK FOR A FUCKING LIVING. I'm FUCKING TIRED when I get home, and I'm even MORE fucking tired if this celebration of foolishness that goes on here. You all want a fucking magic phrase, and think it's all about how your documents are worded or phrased, FFS. All people are capable of around here is talking shit, and THAT is why most of you are doomed. \n</blockquote>\n\nYou're all bad people who are doomed.\n\n<blockquote>\nTender for law?!?!? Really!?!?!? You honestly think that the Chinese are subject to our law if they hold Canadian currency in reserve, or that they are subject to the USA for holding their currency in reserve. You think that the use of a dollar bill binds you to statutes? Enjoy the stagnant reality that is about to become your education in law.\n</blockquote>\n\nI didn't make the law, I just explain it, so what you and I think the Chinese are going to do, is largely irrelevant. THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER, does in fact establish JOINDER (Not \"bind\") when you USE it. It's how commerce is CURRENTLY done. It's unsustainable. I'm showing EVERYONE how to LEAVE it and still have the benefit WITHOUT JOINDER, but yes according to EVERYTHING IN JURISPRUDENCE, COMMERCE, and PUBLIC POLICY, it DOES establish JOINDER.\n\nPretending it does not ignores reality. The people ENFORCING the LEGAL aspects don't care what the Chinese will do. They don't care what Dean believes, and they CERTAINLY don't care which one of US you believe.\n\nUse your heads. Look at everything I write (ESPECIALLY the C.A.S. article) and look for YOURSELF. READ what he is saying, and read what I am saying. He is giving BAD ADVICE. A MOTION and/or APPLICATION also makes JOINDER. Pretending it does not is just stupid! AGAIN, all he has to say about his bad advice is \"it's worked in the past\", completely ignoring the JOINDER issue. Special Appearance means you cannot APPLY or MOTION ANYTHING. DOING SO MAKES YOU SURETY!

Since every country that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) touches is in receivership, any money created must comply with the IMF's receivership rules.  As with everything the U.S. dollar touches, the rules are designed to exploit the ignorant.   For hundreds of years corporations have made their own money as a matter of course.   What did you think \"in-store credit\" was?  However, in order for money to be \"LEGAL\" it MUST have the following:\n\nIt must have a signature making a promise\nIt must have a signature endorsing that promise\nIt must be received by a TRUSTEE\n\nEvery document you submit for court is stamped \"Received\".  As you were taught, there are no homonyms in law, and there are no synonyms in law.  Legally, \"Received\" is a banking term.   The only PARTIES LEGALLY allowed to exchange this money are LAWYERS.   This ATTORNEY GENERAL MONEY makes up the bulk of a lawyer's fee, and it comes directly out of your share of the CONSOLIDATED RESERVE FUND.   That guy, Derek Moran (who likes to circle-jerk to ACTS, CODES and STATUTES) will likely be able to point you to where you can substantiate this; but trust me when I say, that the primary mandate of GOVERNMENT is CHARITY.   If you really want to send your head for a spin, look up the LEGAL definition of \"charity\".   Then ask yourself why there needs to be a legal definition for a distinctly common word.  \n\nThe GOVERNMENT is obligated to look after the cattle owned by the LAW SOCIETY.  ATTORNEY GENERAL MONEY is literally open betting with your lives.  It's all happening right in front of you, and you didn't even see the money.  This is true universally.  If there are two signatures, and the TRUSTEE is MINISTRY OF NATURAL RESOURCES, then that is MINISTRY OF NATURAL RESOURCES MONEY.   All of these are simply the trading of SECURITIES.   Nothing is being traded except your future time.  The money must come from somewhere, but it always ends up in the pocket of a lawyer.   Their client may pay them a million dollars, but from that they'll get another nine million in ATTORNEY GENERAL MONEY.  That's why trials cost as much as they do.   \n\nThink about that from your own experience:\n\nA wedding is harder to arrange than a court hearing, and you can do that for less than fifty thousand dollars - and that's INCLUDES Venue, support staff, and Catering! That's RETAIL pricing, too!\n\nThe bill you get from a lawyer gets multiplied the second you pay it.  Because a lawyer can cash that paid invoice in for all the ATTORNEY GENERAL MONEY he generated.  \n\nYou, the lowly CITIZEN and loyal tax payer, are the ones who pick up the tab.  You've already contributed to the \"loose change bowl\" that is the CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FUND.  Since Scott Duncan has been so public about all of these things, you will find that the courts dislike the modern pro se litigant, as they ask too many uncomfortable questions.   People are saying this is wrong, and they always seem to do it through AGENCY.   After three years it should become obvious that no lawyer, ACTING as a LAWYER, and no government official, ACTING as a GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, will ever say Scott Duncan is wrong - but they will never say he is right.  The minute they say he is right, they are admitting to FRAUD.   Scott Duncan knows this.  In fact, he briefed the LAW SOCIETY and the ATTORNEY GENERAL four years ago as to what he intended to do.  \n\nI hope this little expansion regarding the nature of ATTORNEY GENERAL MONEY, has also expanded your knowledge; and will prompt you to start asking GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS and the LAW SOCIETY the really uncomfortable questions.  If you truly want to give Scott Duncan VALUE, this is how you do it.  Remember what he told you about receiving VALUE: \n\n\"Take what you need and give the rest to everyone.\"\n\nStart asking questions.  If you get stuck, post your questions here.  Inform all PARTIES you communicate with, that you intend to publish.  You should not have to hide your intent, because as Scott also says, \"The good guys don't  hide.\" "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_957112567658009","body":""},{"post_id":"462493170453287_955318324504100","body":"So, there's an administrative hearing for EAMONN O BRIEN on Wednesday morning.

I haven't exactly made it a state secret either.   That said, many of you are extremely 'grateful'.   I have no idea why.  If some stranger showed up, out of nowhere, and showed me that virtually everything I see, hear, think and believe is a lie, and that I'm incapable of critical thought, I don't think I'd be that overjoyed.  That's what your reaction is supposed to be.  You're supposed to be angry.  You're supposed to use that anger as motivation to either, confirm or refute, what I have said.  Those who attempt to refute me are attempting to refute reality, and they fail every time.  Those who attempt to confirm what I say are always really hurt that I was right.  \n\nFor some reason my knowing as much as I do, really hurts people's feelings.  A disturbing number of people are frightened by it.   There is nothing I can do about that.  The fear reaction is an evolutionary response designed to alert you to danger.  The danger has always been there though.  Many of you fail to grasp that, even though you have this new insight, nothing in reality has changed - you just know more.\n\nCurrently this group has fewer than forty members.  I still think that's too many.  The fewer people there are here, the fewer \"shit stains\" can show up.  However, the group is public, and anyone can read it.  The gold is in the comments, and there is almost four years' of information to go through.  Many people review this information.  In fact, hundreds do.  Sometimes people message me, and they unwittingly end up in \"We get letters\".    But what about those who don't end up in this unfortunate category?  What of the ones that actually receive the answers they are seeking, instead of the abuse those trying to game the system might receive?   Those with a legitimate question, I always answer; and if it's information all of you can use, I usually request they publish the question in the group.  The rest I help out, as best I can, with the limited mental resources they possess.   I'm sure you thought that was condescending (that means talking down to people :) ).  That doesn't change the fact that it's true.  Your AGENTS made me.  I was sold as raw material to your AGENTS.  Your AGENTS gave me the knowledge, and the abilities, to simply know more than the rest of you.  \n\nThis is simply a fact.  I am a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far.  So are you.  I don't possess any mental powers that you don't.  I was, however, programmed differently at a key age - with intent.  I literally have \"after market\" upgrades, and for twenty years I did my job very, very well.  Of course I did.  I couldn't help it.  The problem is that when you're young and you have these advantages, you are by your very nature, incapable of avoiding the trap of thinking wrong and valuing the wrong things.  At the time, your AGENTS were those I considered my benefactors.  Had I not dared asked, \"Have we the right?\" those many years ago, it would probably be me directing the war against the FREE-DUMBERS and the \"Sovereign Citizens\"; and I'm sure I would have purged all of them as efficiently as I purged people in government that might have been able to help.   It was my job.  And...as I stated before, I was very, very good at it.\n\nEveryone should keep this in mind when they talk about how grateful they are, because the weapons I use against the government today, are the ones that worked against me those many years ago.  What prompted me to ask \"Have we the right?\"  It would be easier to list the alphabet agencies that didn't employ my services during my heyday.  What did I get in return?  - access to technology years, sometimes decades, ahead of everyone else.  You take a lot of things for granted these days like open source software and hardware.  Even in the late 1980's when the Gnu Public License (GPL) was in its infancy, you could get access to the software, but you'd need to drop $60,000 for the hardware to run it.  Now I can buy a supercomputer for $5.  Think about that.  In 1989, a Raspberry Pi Zero, which is a $5 computer, would blow away every computer in existence.   Except back then to use a computer, you really had to know what you were doing.  In 1990 I regarded the Internet as the closest thing to social paradise humanity had ever achieved.   The difference is that, back then in order to even 'be' on the Internet, you had to be an academic (studying at a well-funded university) or you had to really know what you were doing.  Now any idiot can get on the Internet.  \n\nI mention these historical facts to give you perspective.   That for which you are feeling gratitude, doesn't exist.  When you succeed, I succeed, but not in the ways you think.  You are effectively a shell fired from a cannon.  Each success that you have is a devastating blow.  Those tasked to respond to such attacks tend not to feel the impact until months after the fact.  When I explain law, and get you asking the right people the hard questions, I am firing a weapon.  Unfortunately I rely on your crippled brains as the guidance system.  I'm always very happy when you succeed.   Again, not for the reasons you might think.  \n\nUnderstand that I know what goes on behind the scenes when you do these things.  Their abilities to react are limited. ..\n\n...which brings me to a digression I feel is necessary.\n\nWhen you say, \"Scott Duncan says 'hi'\",  you are literally signing your attack with my name.  That frightens a lot of \"higher ups\".  The problem is the higher-ups in question are two generations removed from those that made me.  I think more of us survived than was intended.  Dan and Donna are still here, which is surprising because they \"failed\" their training/tests.  I'm what happens when they \"succeed\".  \n\nKeep that in mind when you say, \"Scott Duncan says 'Hi'\", because I am a terrifying relic, from a less politically correct time; a time which produced many things the government would very much like to forget and/or make disappear.   I'm not going to try to discourage you from saying,  \"Scott Duncan says 'Hi'\", because let's face it...it's hilarious on several different levels.   Just pay some mind to the reactions the receiver of this NOTICE might have.\n\n...I digress.\n\nBack to gratitude.  I'm really, really happy that I can solve your problems.  I'm even happier when you realize that YOU didn't create them.  I'm really happy I gave you an understanding you didn't have before - but I don't really care.  Just last night I received an \"I'm so grateful\" phone call.  It was a woman too!  You'd think by now she'd know how to properly express her 'gratitude'.  It's really, really simple.  Choose one of the designated uniforms (naughty school girl, porno secretary, slutty nuclear physicist) and memorize your lines (1: That hurts mister, 2: Do it harder, 3: I've been a bad girl) - and then just show up :)  Seriously, how fucking hard is that???\n\n...otherwise, fuck off with your gratitude!  It benefits me in no way whatsoever!\n\nThe woman that called last night said, \"I just had to thank you\", to which I responded, \"Why?\"  How do I benefit from that?  I don't get smarter, or richer - hell I don't even get stress-relieving sex out of it!\n\nI had to explain very slowly that the reason she \"just had to thank me\" is that she's running a debt relief program.  It's why I don't accept any of your \"thanks\".  You're running a program, which means you're telling a lie.  When you are \"thankful\" to me, YOU ARE LYING!   When you are \"grateful\" to me, YOU ARE LYING!  I know this, because I've heard it a million times before, and I know how the program works.  There are no words you could speak in expression of this alleged gratitude, that Andrew D'Spyder-Pig(tm) hasn't also said.  I've heard it all before, and your words are as worthless as the fat tub-of-shit who uttered them previously is.   If you want to show gratitude, send me some bacon made from the hide of a genuine Spyder-pig.   Otherwise, I don't want to hear it.  I don't care if you're grateful.  You're exploded ordinance.  Your work is done, and you benefitted.   That's the way things should be.  You do a job...and you get paid!  You volunteered to do a job for me - and you got paid.  The transaction is complete.   Ask yourself why you feel the need to communicate something I have made a concerted effort to NOTIFY you, that I do not want.   I do not VALUE your thanks.  I VALUE your actions.  I VALUE you doing things that haven't been done before.  I VALUE the results of the knowledge I've given you - as it should be.  \n\nYou think wrong and you value the wrong things.  Of all my Scottisms(tm), that one is the crown.  If you accept that as truth, then you must also accept that as the one who told you, I don't think wrong and I don't value the wrong things.  The reason it's so easy to make any one of you look evil and stupid, is that you're evil and stupid.  You value the things that evil and stupid people do.  That's what makes you evil and stupid.  Why do you think I would want thanks from someone who is evil and stupid?  If you happen to be male, or a female who doesn't feel like feeding any of my many addictions, then learn to express proper gratitude.  Pete Daoust thanks me by actually doing something.  Michael Atkins thanks me by actually doing something.  Eamonn O'Brien thanks me by actually doing something.  That's the gratitude I VALUE.   That's thanks that actually means something. ..and that's what makes \"You're welcome\" more than just a mere platitude.   It's one of the things that motivates me and keeps me going.  \n\nI've shown you almost everything you're capable of understanding at this point.  I have built, and am building, things that cannot be used yet, because there are not enough people who understand.  All of you are still taking inventory of what was stolen from you.  I can assure you that is a waste of time.  You're not qualified to understand what was stolen from you; and if you think you're angry now, wait until you are qualified.   I keep stressing the point.  I am fundamentally no different than you.  We're all semi-evolved chimps that made it this far.  Everything else is \"shit we made up\".   Yet, I am demonstrably \"more\" than you.  The only reason this is true is that I was manufactured by your government.  In order to do the jobs I was being groomed for, they couldn't steal from me what they stole from you.  No matter how hard I try, I cannot conceptualize living life through your crippled eyes.  You have a myriad of programs and filters that were socially-engineered into you by long-dead strangers.  Each generation adds to these programs, and now I'm considered rude and crazy, when I point out the fact that I live in a world where it's perfectly normal to be \"an adult with an imaginary friend\".  \n\nYou have been robbed, and you claim to feel gratitude for the efforts I have put forth to demonstrate this.  If this is true, then try to get back what was stolen from you.  Trust me when I say it's going to be one of the most difficult repossessions ever, but I promise you it's worth the effort.  \n\nIf you're feeling compelled by gratitude, ask yourself why.  I've written extensively about how much I don't give a shit, so I get the irony, but that doesn't address the actual point.  You are running a program.  It is a program somebody put there.  That somebody is long-dead so you can't call them to account.  What you can do, is call to account those who would dare exploit it today.   There are a lot of people that do.  Virtually every agent in the \"Justice System\" exploits that program to some degree.  It's why they never got rid of it.  It's too useful.  In order to social-engineer on a large scale, and to embed a program that deeply, you require man power, infrastructure (like schools and churches), and a hierarchy to dictate policy.   And, it needs to start from childhood.   It's costly, and it consumes resources, so the end result had better be worth it.   The fact that such a program exists at all, proves that it clearly is.  It's part of a much larger program which I have labelled, \"Everybody knows\".  You've seen examples of \"Everybody knows\".  They're not hard to spot if you know what to look for.  If  \"everybody knows\" something, and this thing that \"everybody knows\" is absurd upon further examination, you are looking at the by-product of the larger \"Everybody knows\" program.  For the longest time, everybody knew that you don't question religion, or you don't talk about your salary, or you don't ask who somebody voted for; and when questioned they'll angrily respond, it's \"common knowledge\", \"everybody knows\", you \"do/don't do that\".  You must always be cautious of by-products from the \"Everybody knows\" program.   A lot of time, effort, resources and money, are churned out daily to maintain the copy of \"Everybody knows\" that's running in your empty, little head right now.  All of you are crippled by your own love of some bullshit belief, and if you want any hope for the future, you might start with getting rid of those bullshit beliefs.   \n\nEvery one of you that calls to \"thank me\", because they \"JUST HAD TO\", has never produced an answer when I ask why they \"just had to\".   None of you ever stop and question why you \"believe\" what you do!   I don't know what it's like to run the programs you have.  My very nature prohibits me from understanding your experience in any meaningful way.   I was literally created to maintain the programs you are currently running.   What's even more frightening, is that I was a more sophisticated version of what existed before.  Not only was I built to maintain these things, I was built to deploy new ones.  It keeps me up at night, wondering if my profound love of computer science, is nothing but a program somebody put there.  Then I remember it's the government.  They're not that smart - they never were; because in the end, I'm the failed by-product of ambitious idiots.  One's a drooling vegetable - the rest are dead.  I lament the fact that I had a hand in so few of their deaths.  I learned a long time ago that it's pointless to target old people.  Target what they leave behind.  Engineer circumstances so their children implode.  Impede them every step of the way.  It's surprisingly easy to do, and a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nAs I said to my grateful caller last night, \"I'm not a good man, I'm an honest man\".  It is vital that you understand they're not the same thing.  You presume they are at your own peril.  \n\n...and now the point.  \n\nThese urges where you \"just have to thank me\" are a program designed to trigger an endorphin response.  You quite correctly realize that a debt has been incurred, and you very mistakenly think the utterance of the words, \"Oh thank you, kind sir\" somehow discharges this debt.  If anything, your thanks acknowledges and perfects the debt...and when I say, \"You're welcome\", I mean you're welcome to the debt.  It's yours, and you still hold it.   If nothing else, I am a man who collects his debts, no matter how long it takes.  \n\nSo yes, I'm awesome.  I already know that.  You don't need to tell me.  I've led a life that would make most of you weep with envy.  I have a standard of living better than 98% of the planet, and better than the richest in all of recorded history.  I've shown you the advantages you have today, that no humans have ever had.  I made the grandiose claim that you could be your own bank, and make your own money, and that it would be better than any bank or money that exists today.  It's all new to you.  Everything new to you, is at least five years old to me.  It's just the way it has always been.  I don't know life without it.  I never will.  So you have something I will never have - an experience that I can never have.  Think about it.  Whenever I show you something \"new\" it's suddenly everywhere, and there's a shitload of information about it too.  Even if you joined this group when I started it, Bitcoin was almost three year's old at the time.  I told you that the blockchain was the point, not the currency.  Then Ethereum shows up, proving my point.   All of this happened right in front of you, yet I have no special powers.  I don't possess any mental powers you don't.  The reason you perceive such a huge difference between us, is that you are hobbled by countless programs which most of you are far too old to purge.   There's hope for your children though.  The simple ethic of \"take what you need and give the rest to everyone\" is the first value you should instill in children.  Imagine if \"wars\" were fought on that basis.  Imagine if the hostile act was donating your nation's surplus to your enemy.  If every child was taught to take what it needs, and to give the rest to everyone, it would destroy all those evil programs you're currently running.  They'd become laughable relics two generations from now.  As soon as I say it, you know it's true; but it will never happen because it takes time, effort, resources, manpower and materials, to maintain those programs you're currently running.   Most of all it costs MONEY.  Lots of money.  It's automated, and it's self-maintaining, but you have to feed it money to keep it alive.  \n\nIt all comes down to money.  What you know as \"law\" is the by-product of money.  LEGAL = SURETY and ACCOUNTING, the rules of which are TENDERED through that ACCOUNTING.  This one simple fact has never been told to you by anybody else.  As soon as I say it, you know it's true.  If it doesn't instantly \"click\" for you, you're likely one of those who will fall into the crowd that attempts to \"disprove what I say\".  Attempts to do that are foolish, because it will only help me, and will only help you look evil and stupid.  Don't let me discourage you from trying though.  The reason you were never taught this is that the people aware of this, are paid not to tell you.  I, on the other hand, am not paid, so I tell you.  See how that works?  Every lawyer that was called to the bar, is paid not to tell you.  Every chartered accountant that sets PUBLIC POLICY, is paid not to tell you.  Every revenue collecting AGENCY of the GOVERNMENT, is paid not to tell you.  Every \"Justice\", pretending to be a judge, is paid not to tell you.  Again...I'm not paid.  It's very difficult to \"pay\" me.  I won't accept money that was taken by force from others.  I refuse to benefit from the proceeds of crime.  The government can't pay me.  They once paid me in the only way that they could - through concessions, POLICIES and UNDERTAKINGS, which were supposed to be in place for my lifetime, but are now suddenly forgotten and/or ignored.  This means the government can't even pay me that way.  If you're wondering why, refer to that whole, \"fool me once\" adage.  This isn't really difficult.  \n\nI hope this post makes my position on the whole \"gratitude\" thing as unambiguous as possible.  I've tried really hard to get the message across.  Yes, I get it.  Your life has changed, and I saved you from <insert peril here>, and you just had to thank me.  Good.  I accept your acknowledgement of the debt you owe me.  Unlike the government, I'm not hampered by any ACT, CODE or STATUTE as regards the debt owed to me.  This means I can literally base my interest rate on my mood, and I do charge interest on my debts.  I advise you not to leave the debt open for too long, because if I achieve my goal of becoming really, really old, other people's corpses are going to be really VALUABLE to me, and may eventually become the only way to pay that debt.  Who knows what the future holds?  Oh wait...I do.  \n\nIf you really want to thank me, put forth the effort to figure out what it is that I value; because at the moment you're not qualified to be asking that question.  Be warned that one is a time-consuming rabbit-hole that I guarantee will fundamentally change you - and probably not for the better.  You can take solace in the knowledge that the mere effort benefits me every time.   You, however, are the one that pays the price.  Don't say I didn't warn you, and you discover what I value at your own peril. \n\nOtherwise, you can thank me by taking what you have learned, and ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING.  \n\nLet me say that again, just so we're clear.  You are not qualified to thank me in any other way -- so, take what I have taught you, and ACTUALLY FUCKING DO SOMETHING!\n\nTL;DR: Do shit.

It is more of an underlying, private, gap-filling collection of rules of law that allow relations among the people who live here to be conducted in predictable and fair ways - at least in principle.

I'd appreciate help breaking this apart. \n\nMy intention was to have an \"official\" communique from the Attorney General's office to establish that Ontario is indeed a common law jurisdiction. It seems to raise more questions than it answers. \n\nMy hope here is to put some \"powerful\" questions to him that will either \"force\" him to lie (due to his oath to protect the law society), or, have him admit some facts that may serve me/us in the future.\n\nHere's the response:\n\n****\n\nThank you for your recent inquiry to the Ministry of the Attorney General’s web site about whether Ontario is a common law jurisdiction.  I have been asked to respond on behalf of the Ministry.\n\nIt is accurate to say that Ontario is a common law jurisdiction, that is, a territory with applicable law based in part on the common law.\n\nThe expression ‘common law’ refers to the law developed over the years by judges in deciding court cases. The expression is usually used to distinguish this body of law from ‘statute law’, i.e. the law adopted in statutes passed by the Legislature or by Parliament for Canada as a whole.  However, statute law prevails over common law, so the Legislature can change the common law by passing legislation.\n\nThe Legislature’s powers are limited by the Constitution both as to the division of legislative powers between the federal and the provincial government, and by individual rights protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nFor example, much of the law about contracts is common law; it arises from court decisions about individual lawsuits that involved contracts.  However, the Legislature has passed the Sale of Goods Act (in the late 19th century) and the Consumer Protection Act (in the mid-20th century) to clarify or to improve the rules about contracts, or to make them more accessible to the general public.\n\nIn most cases a mix of sources of the law will apply to any situation. Legal rules are not more or less valid because they have more or less common law or statutory content.\n\nThe Ministry of the Attorney General publishes several general guides to the law online. General legal information is available at Justice Ontario, the Ministry’s legal information site. To access Justice Ontario, please visit our website at:\n\n www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/justice-ont/\n\n A source of both court decisions and the text of statutes for all of Canada – federal government and the provinces – is www.canlii.org, a product of the Federation of Law Societies.\n\n Once again, thank you for contacting the Ministry. \n\nJohn D.

As this is my forum, I think I will prevent the concept of TRUSTS being diminished any further by this scam. \n\nSo OPPF it is.\n\nBefore I get started about this, I'm going to raise another TRUST system.  It should have died at the outset because one guy ends up with the money.  I'm talking about bitcoin, except you can TRUST and VERIFY bitcoin.  It is a mathematical process that requires no trust.  You don't need to trust bitcoin any more than you need to trust 2 + 2 = 4; and that's why bitcoin is a perfectly viable currency until the guy who started it gets all the money.\n\nIt is an automated-accounting, self-regulated currency.  Bitcoin is the by-product of our knowledge of fundamental universal truths regarding numbers.  For math is a pure discipline.  There's nothing more to learn about it, and trillions of undiscovered things you can do with what we know.\n\nI see a beauty and elegance, and even humour for those who can read the math in bitcoin.  And that's why you can TRUST, because you get to VERIFY.\n\nNow let's look at the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD. \n\nThose that can't be bothered clogging up valuable intellect with bullshit, can reduce OPPF to its base components...and it basically goes like this...\n\nThree guys “reclaim” the world's wealth by way of the UCC, backed by the people in the TRUST.  Except in every context with the UCC SERVICING NOTICE, etc., they are all LEGAL CLAIMS.  The mere fact that you are GIVING NOTICE acknowledges the process.  A TRUST cannot make aggressive moves like SERVING NOTICE and MAKING A CLAIM.  A TRUST has AUTHORITY over what it RECEIVES.  TRUSTS exist to fulfill a purpose based on ASSETS it has RECEIVED.  \n\nA TRUST IS NOT A PERSON UNDER LAW.  \n\nA TRUST IS NOT A PARTY UNDER LAW.\n\nAnd a TRUST can only RECEIVE.\n\nThe AQUILAE TRUST, for example, has a PRIMARY MANDATE to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to The House of Windsor.  This is a relatively unattainable goal.  I don't think I'll see Queen Elizabeth II saying, “Off with his head” in my lifetime, but that is, in fact, its PRIMARY MANDATE.  \n\nAs it is a PRIVATE TRUST (PRIVATEER) we stand by to SERVE The House of Windsor.  The House of Windsor can give AQUILAE an ORDER, and can TRUST that the ORDERS will be followed, even though The House of Windsor has no LEGAL or LAWFUL AUTHORITY over AQUILAE.\n\nEvery TRUSTEE is aware of this, and if 'Liz says, “Suit up and go to war”, we “Suit up and go to war”, because we said we would and she can TRUST us to do so.\n\nPROMISARY NOTES have the CREDIT and WORTH of those making the promises.  ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD are making promises they cannot LEGALLY AND/OR LAWFULLY keep.  \n\nIt is therefore reasonable to presume, based on the preponderance of EVIDENCE, that the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD exists SOLEY for the purpose of profiting from your credulity.\n\nYou have often heard me speak ill of Robert Menard, but I want you to pay close attention to what I speak.  Robert Menard tells the absolute TRUTH about the law.  In fact, I dare say you can almost (but not quite) TRUST what he says about law.  If it's the TRUTH it doesn't matter who says it.  2 + 2 = 4.  It doesn't matter if I say it, or if Robert Menard says it, or if Charles Manson says it...2 + 2 will still equal 4. \n\nHowever, Robert Menard lies through omission.  If you ever want to see Robert Menard fumble around, and ask bullshit-deflecting questions, just ask him what “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER” means.  \n\nONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD is FRAUD at the outset.  Always remember the noble lie.  If it requires BELIEF in anything, spirits, gods, fairies, etc., you are being sold FRAUD.  There are no exceptions to this rule.\n\nFrom childhood you are sold the lie that faith and trust are equal, and they reinforce it with other lies like, “You must respect the beliefs of others.”  Think about that for a second.  Why must I respect the beliefs of others?  Why have belief at all?  If you examine the concept, belief is an end.  It means you don't have to go looking any further.  It means you can “just assume”, never having once examine WHY it should be believed.\n\nObserve the threads in this very forum.  My mere public position that “your ignorance does not equal my knowledge” immediately gets a million ad hominem attacks.  I collect the names you call me like trophies, and all of you that call me these things remind me that none of you are capable of having original thought.\n\nAll because I have offended your “beliefs”.  \n\nAnd you enter with the arrogant position that if I don't believe what you do, there must be something wrong with me, which reveals your hypocrisy.  You see, in order for you to have the opportunity to say these things about me, you most certainly would have had to initiate the communication; because the only reason you would talk to me is because you want my knowledge.  \n\nI would not talk to you.  Your very beliefs negate the possibility of UNDERSTANDING.  You have nothing of VALUE for me, and presenting an “alternate view” which focuses on bullshit always seems to neglect to mention the fact that it is, in fact, focused on bullshit. \n\nIn short, belief has no VALUE.  Those who say it does are selling you FRAUD, and you must always suspect the motives of those selling demonstrable FRAUD as TRUST.\n\nThe most primitive example of the self-imposed ignorance of belief can be found in Roman Numerals; and before I start with this I just want to remind everyone that the Ancient Greeks calculated the circumference of the earth, so the concept of zero was well-known throughout history.  If you BELIEVE otherwise, examine the source of that belief and you will discover it is, in fact, bullshit.\n\nThe number zero represents fifty percent of all math in existence.  If you do not understand that statement, and do not understand why that is, you are not qualified to speak of math.  I digress...\n\nI think of my own personal knowledge of computer science, and the vast technological powers I wield simply because “nobody else knows how to do it.”  I cringe in empathetic fear for humanity when I look upon its nine billion souls, all in some way, intimately tied to science and technology, and knowing nothing about science and technology.  Even the most simple-minded amongst you cannot be so stupid that they cannot see this situation is a recipe for disaster.\n\nAnd every day, I'll hear some ignorant, credulous adult, with an imaginary friend, declare that I am ignorant, and that I am “closed-minded”, of course; and this is my personal favorite, that I'm “mentally ill” or some sub-category therein. \n\nThese people truly believe that their ignorance is wisdom, and that their belief equals my knowledge; and that is precisely why I DO NOT RESPECT THE BELIEFS OF OTHERS.\n\nLet's jump back in time to the Romans.  The Romans had a technologically-evolving society.  Mathematics and computer science were actually in heavy use, and numeric policy and process allowed those that could conceptualize the math to engineer aqueducts that are working to this day.  \n\nComputer Science is profoundly powerful knowledge.  I have the ability to literally speak to the universe, and it will speak back – in numbers.  The test for intelligence is the test of understanding prime numbers, for these things are universal, and all of it requires not one scrap of belief.\n\nThose who don't see that only prove my point, because it's as true as 2 + 2 = 4...\n\n...and I'll demonstrate with the Romans.\n\nBookkeeping's a boring job, isn't it?  Those who have been saddled with such a task will know what I'm describing when I speak of numbers dancing in your head, and you, being a pattern-seeking mammal, indulge yourself in the boredom   by seeing how you make these numbers dance in a pattern you have not yet seen.\n\nThis is actually a very profound process and a lot of people miss it.  The last thing the Romans wanted were smart bookkeepers.  Bookkeepers make the rules.  None of you see that.  Watch “The Agenda” with Steve Paikin.  VALE and the Chartered Accountants of Ontario sponsor the show, and they'll proudly tell you how long they've been setting PUBLIC POLICY.  \n\nNone of you are aware of this, because none of you think; and Steve Paikin's shows are for people who can think, so there's zero risk of discovery.\n\nYou can see for yourself, your masters laughing at your idiocy.\n\nAll the belief in the world is not going to change that reality....\n\n...back to the Romans.\n\nA society that's growing as a result of computer science needs to hide the computer science part.  I know more than you do by default.  I've simply dedicated more time to any subject you raise than you have to studying it.  It doesn't matter what you believe...this is simply true.  \n\nI don't possess any mental powers you don't; and I don't possess any mental powers that the bookkeeper with “dancing-numbers-in-his-head” has.  \n\nYou can see where this is going.\n\nDiscovery of computer science is inevitable, and accountants will find it first.  I'm not going to find any gold in the Klondike if I don't go to the Klondike.  You're not going to find computer science if you don't go to where math is used constantly.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to one simple goal.  How do you stop a smart, little bookkeeper from discovering computer science, without affecting the quality of his work?  Enter the Roman Numeral system.  \n\nLiteracy was restricted to the upper casts; and the ignorant will leap and cling to what they can understand.  In less than one generation the Roman Numeral system was injected into society with the DECLARATION, “This is math!”\n\n...and there you have it.  The next generation will truly believe that Roman Numerals are actual numbers.  They show the math function, and thus no one has reason to believe that the declaration, “This is math” was a lie, or that anyone's agenda was being served by believing that lie.\n\nSuch beliefs cause the believers of Roman Numerals to say that those “crazy people” who have no faith in the Roman Numeral system and their kooky religious terms like fast Fourier transform (FFT), Fibonacci  Sequences, and calculus are just products of their ignorance...\n\n...is this sounding familiar?\n\nDo you get the idea?\n\nAnd so we return to ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD.\n\nIn the comments below I'll go step-by-step through the very base principles your beliefs have made you blind to.  Unlike any other time in history, we all have the wealth of human knowledge at our fingertips.  The ONLY weapon that those who work against your interests possess, is your ignorance.  Belief is what gives ignorance VALUE to them.\n\nIgnorance serves those working against your interests.\n\nThe people who sell you these FRAUDS are so effective because they truly believe in them, and of course that belief serves another unseen agenda...\n\n...because the people that mean you harm, don't actually know you.  It's not personal.  You're a cow to be herded, because THEY took the time to learn things YOU didn't.\n\nAnd to the adults with imaginary friends, I dare say you attribute every “good” quality in you to that imaginary friend; and all the bad qualities in you, you attribute to yourself, because you're “a horrible wretched sinner” that needs “forgiving” for some unknown crime called “sin”.  \n\nThere really are people that laugh at the fact that immorality is sold as morality.  It gives them comfort that in 2013, declaring that you're an adult with an imaginary friend is not only “normal”, but is in fact a prerequisite for becoming President of the United States.\n\nI'm told that Governor of Alaska is another possibility too.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out why stating the truth is “ego”.  It is always the first motivator that I'm accused of.  I suspect it's loosely connected to the other strange belief that people's hurt feelings make my position wrong; and if they're Christian they seem to think some sort of harm should come to me as a result. They counter this vile thought with some empty expression of “love”, because Love hasn't been diminished by belief enough!\n\nYou have to see things from my perspective as well.  When you declare that you're “offended”, there's an automatic process that I programmed, with intent in my head, and it routes all data from that point on, to the same place in my head that I route whining.  For, in the end, when you say that you're offended, you should just presume that my response is, “So what?”  You're whining does not change what I said.\n\nAll that being said, I request you, friends, comrades, brothers, sisters, to try to keep the banter to a minimum; and I know I'm as guilty as you are for this...\n\nI've had a good stern talk with myself on the subject regarding this thread.\n\nI am going to go through this whole document of THE ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD.  We're going to play “Biology Class” with this piece of LEGAL BULLSHIT.\n\nI am going to put this fake “living document” (powered by “Belief”) on the stainless steel table, and while it cries out for mercy, I shall carve out its entrails, piece-by-piece.  And we shall examine these entrails while it writhes in pain.\n\nAnd then we'll toss away those pieces because they don't survive the light of understanding.  At the end of our little legal biology class, with two goals accomplished, you will see the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD for what it is, and I will have given it the slow and painful execution it so richly deserves.

They’ve handcuffed me. (Oct. 2014)\n\n2). They’ve brought me into a cage.\n\n3). They’ve searched my pockets and suitcase\n\n4). They’ve found Government ID’s\n\n5). They’ve used these ID’s without my consent and without telling me WHO was the party with surety.\n6). They’ve took PICTURES of my face by force\n\n7). They’ve asked me several times for my NAME, I always answered: I am pierre, the man who possess the legal entity named PIERRE DAOUST inscription 1196604112851, and its SOLE authorized Administrator and asked WHERE IS SURETY. They even WROTE this in their police report, trying to make me look like a crazy guy :D\n\n8). They asked me to follow them so they could take my fingerprints, I said no thanks, they said we are five here, and we will take your fingerprints by force, and rest assure that we will take your fingerprints, like it or not. So I said well, in spite of myself, I will follow you.\n\n9). I NEVER gave my signature to any of their stuff.\n\n10). They’ve wrote four traffic tickets in the name of PIERRE DAOUST. How in the fuck the ACCUSED can be UNIDENTIFIABLE after this ? :D\n\n11). I asked for surety again, they laughed and said, what the fuck are you on with this surety thing, I said ARE YOU GOING TO VIOLATE THE RIGHT TO THE SURETY TO ME ?, they said, not only us we will, but the JUDGE will too. I said, thanks for the information.\n\n12) They brought me in front of the judge, I have lost it at that point and yelled WHERE THE FUCK IS SURETY…..they made me sleep there, and the day after, I have managed to get out, without surety…..all that, happened in October 2014.\n\n13).

To make a long story short, that was the “pro-forma” The justice told me that the party with surety will be present for the hearing, on nov.16th 2015.\n\n16) I have gave the JUSTICE a copy of these three documents he received via registered mail, because I asked him if he read them, and he said no I haven’t seen them :/\n\n17). Again, that day, I said I AM pierre, the MAN who possesses the juridical personality named PIERRE DAOUST inscription number 1196604112851, no one argued to this… :P\n\n18).

"},{"post_id":"462493170453287_901304093238857","body":"In the spirit of posting something that helps me because it might help others, I put forward the following:\n\nI posted a comment some time back, where I related part of a conversation I had with Scott Duncan. In that post, I mentioned that he is the only man who had ever taken the time with me to actually look up the definition of a word before resuming the conversation. Well, recently, that same word came up in another conversation I was having with someone else and guess what.... I had forgotten the precise definition. One of the things we are learning here is how damn important it is to be precise. So I had to go and look up that word again. But is that it? \n\nIt was not so long ago, for me anyways, that yes, that would be it. But now, you see, I am putting some of the pieces together. I can \"see\" that my brain is actually running a program.... (thanks Scott) And I can \"see\" some of how it is working, and I can also see some of that \"filter\" in action. So in order to carry on into the next revision I wanted to make a change. \n\nI think that it is horrible that I forgot. It is small and insignificant on the surface sure, but when you dig a little deeper it really stings. Look at it this way... Here is a man whose time is very precious, and he gave me some of that time, for free, without asking anything in return... To impart something important unto me. So now, a year later, I had forgot something. I mean, if I let that pass it is like shitting on him for his efforts isn't it?\n\nSo Fuck that. I want to figure out why, these words that I thought I knew but meant something other than what I thought, seem to slip back into the wrong category again with forgetfullness. I had invested the time and energy into looking something up only to have it slip away. I have experienced this more than once now, and now that I am watching for glitches in my thinking, I see them all over the place. How many are there that I don't see (yet).\n\nSo I began a couple months ago looking into ways that computer science can help me solve this problem I am having. It is the answer to everything right? Although I have not got it totally sorted (yet) I think I am far enough along with this little experiment on myself to report back to anyone who cares to read this, what I have found.\n\nWhen investigating \"forgetting\" and learning tools, I came across a computer program that is using an algorithm to anticipate the precise point in which someone is about to forget a fact and it then brings it back up again for study/review. You can dig into the articles on their site if you want, just google supermemo and go from there.\n\nOverall, the idea is this. I determine what I want to learn and remember, and I feed that into the program. Then I trust the program to bring that back to my attention when I am about to forget it. In this way, I can be precise about what I want to keep, and what I want to let fall from my mind.\n\nHaving said that, I still think that a program like this is a crutch. Although, if I were to draw a comparison, I think of it like a guy that has been in a wheelchair for years, and now needs to walk... Let him use the crutch until he can do it on his own.\n\nI know that I was/am broken. I know now that I've been lied to all my life. I cannot unlearn what I have been shown. What I can do though is put the effort into NOT doing that to others. I see now, since being exposed to Scott/Tara and the rest of the Tender For Law group, the damage that inflicts. I do NOT want to be a raindrop that contributes to the flood.\n\nSo with more work, perhaps I will purge the rest of the crap, and retain the gold.

I could have sworn we watched him literally MAKE NEW MONEY. Oh that's right, Dean said he was \"crazy\".\n\nThose of us who listened want for nothing. Dean robbed you with his lies and will continue to do so, it seems.\n\nHere in REALITY, if your signature is not on it, IT'S NOT YOUR MONEY.\n\nDean will lie to you about what a signature means. Here in REALITY it means Understanding and SURETY.\n\nDean Clifford thinks all other trusts, contracts or property rights, except his, should be ignored. Scott Duncan just explains what the Legal Documents are. He claims no \"magic\" or \"authority\" in them.\n\nIt's irrelevant, really.\n\nThe record is clear: Dean Clifford sells bullshit. Literally SELLS it (I think the Hamilton Seminar folk need a refund) and what did it get you? ).\n\nScott Duncan gave ANSWERS and a way out. Those that listened to him in 2010 became comically wealthy off of the money (500 BTC) Scott Duncan GAVE them when he taught them how to receive their first payment. For those curious; That's about $180,000 USD today.\n\nDean Clifford wasn't interested, and proceeded to hide what Scott Duncan was doing. I believe \"crazy\" was the word he used?\n\nNow, here he is, lying about money and law, again.\n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW has answered every question and shown everyone what to do. Three years that group has been around. Dean was even IN it for the first year; Right up until he was carted off to the Fortress of Remand! :D\n\nWaste your time listening to Wolverine Cosplay Guy, or listen to those who tell you the truth. Your choice.\n\nAs Scott Duncan often says, \"Reality doesn't care what you believe\". In reality, Scott Duncan showed you YEARS ago, how to make your own currency and bank. Now the pinned post is some cute chick explaining it.\n\nAsk yourself what the next 5 years will be like for Dean Clifford and his ever growing stack of lies. It's pretty predictable.\n\nNow ask yourself what Scott Duncan's same half-decade will be like. I watched that man secure people's futures. He asked nothing in return. NOTHING. He asks for your time and attention. He doesn't want to hear about your delusions or beliefs (Those are why you are being exploited) and won't let you pick and choose the parts you like.\n\n2016 will be a VERY interesting year. We have NO obligations, oaths, or undertakings outside our original mandate. This means Scott Duncan is free to do as he wishes. No restrictions. It means he can tell you things he hasn't told you before. \n\nIf you thought building your own currency/bank  was \"crazy\", you're going to think the insanity of this next 3 years, lacks a word describing that level of \"crazy\"; Banks and Currencies are just the start. Next comes the deployment of the OVERLAY network!\n\nDon't know/care what that is? YOUR LOSS!\n\nFree isn't good enough for you people, it seems. We NEED this part adopted/deployed, so we will PAY you to use it. USE it. Nothing else. No ads. No spyware. No catch. ALL of it will be OPEN SOURCE so you can TRUST and VERIFY what you are running is acting ONLY in your interest, and ONLY at your request.\n\nYou will be providing key infrastructure that cannot be spied on, or shut down, by ANYONE. It will connect you to 3 \"black\" networks so you can be untraceable and have instant access to \"deep web\" sites. It will also be the only place where you can get the next opportunities.\n\nBitcoin was a freebie. Like a crack dealer. The next ones you are going to have to work for.\n\nListen to a lying butt-hurt free-dumber, or listen to THE TENDER FOR LAW. \n\nThe internet NEVER forgets.\n\nTell us, Dean...

Since I don't want this post Lammi-fied (because there is GOING to be ridicule), I am posting this as Copypasta.\n\n****begin copypasta*****\n\nSTATE OF IN THE DISTRICT COURT \nFOR COUNTY \nSTATE OF Nevada \nV.\nYOU Case No. ___________________ \nLETTER ROGATORY FOR RELIEF \nUnder the Hague Convention Title 18 §1781\nI, John Doe, Executor for the JOHN DOE cestui que trust, to notice the Court of my Letter Rogatory to the YOUR COUNTY DISTRICT COURT, and demand my name be cleared of this alleged criminal case for the reasons set forth below:\n1) I, John Doe, have learned that this alleged Court that has scheduled a case/cause/claim against me is not really a court as per the Constitution of the United States, but rather a tribunal operated as a private corporation.\n2) I have learned of the fraud that goes on behind the scenes of these alleged criminal case , which are really civil claims in equity, and the steps taken to securitize these civil claims, without giving full disclosure to the people. I am hereby letting the court know that I am opting out of any contract and do not allow any documents regarding me or my cestui que trust to be securitized and sold to any investors etc.\n3) The fraudulent process is as follows: All cases are civil, though often fraudulently called criminal. The courts are operating under trust law, assuming the Defendant is a decedent. After finding the alleged Defendant guilty, the court clerks sell the judgments to the Federal Courts. Since the Defendant is a decedent, the court officials consider themselves as a beneficiary.\n4) When a judge asks if a person understands, he/she is asking if the person is liable for the bond. I am not responsible for the bond of this/these cases, but I will appoint the Judge as Trustee/Fiduciary and be the beneficiary of all proceeds.\n5) The judgments are stamped with something to the effect of Pay To The Order Of__on the back and taken to the federal discount window. The judgment now becomes a note.\n6) The notes are then pooled together and then become securities, which are yet pooled together and sold as bonds.\n7) Said bonds are liens against me.\n8) The United States Attorney’s Office has a put code number, NAICS (North American Identification Security Classification. Said NAICS number enables the United States Attorney’s Office to trade globally all securities.\n9) All US federal courts are registered with the DOD (Department of Defense), where they are registered with CCR (Contractor’s Central Registration), under the DOD, which another department called DLIS (Defense Logistics Information Service), which issues a cage code, which means a commercial and government entity, which everything corresponds with their bank account.\n10) Said United States Attorney’s Office and Courts have a Dunn’s number (Dunn & Bradstreet).\n11) Everything filed into court is securitized without the knowledge or consent of the people or of all parties.\n12) All criminal cases not heard in an Article 3 court (District Court of the United States) are really civil, however, the courts again commit fraud by labeling the case as criminal. All cases which are plead out or have a guilty conviction label the civil defendant (through unlawful conversion) as felons, when they are not. This is fraud upon the people at large, and certainly fraud upon the alleged Defendants.\n13) The Bank Account is at Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in New York City. The Depository Agreement is signed by the Clerk of Court.\n14) All securities are then deposited with the DTC in New York.\n15) An Escrow Agent is used as a go-between - between the Clerk’s Office and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n16) The securities end up being listed through the Seventh Circuit (Chicago, IL), then sent to the DTCC, the clearinghouse whom lists the securities for trading.\n17) All of the lawyers involved are acting a private debt collectors according to the FDCPA (Title 15§1692). The BAR Association exempts them from having to be registered as such; however, they operate through call warrants, which are like a put, or a call. Doing margin calls is where they convert a case through (similar to a Writ of Execution) use the case number to buy equity securities.\n18) Everything filed into court is securitized and turned into negotiable instruments, and then turning them into securities. These items are sold commercial items, calling them distress debts (Unifund). The items are then pooled together in what is now called a hedge fund, where they are sold globally.\n19) Anytime when there is risk management involved, it is for the securities. This is an underwriting company. When the hedge funds are going into the global market, they go through LuerHermes, a bond holder and underwriting company and subdivision of Alliance SE, of Munich ,Germany (Pimco Bonds).\n20) After 9 months, all paper is converted to a securities status. This is defined in Title 15§77(a)(b)(1) and an now considered to be an investment contract. The paper is endorsed to become a security, and the trust is then collapsed.\n21) The courts have an account with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) under Interpol. The Judges involved and the US Attorneys involved do not have an accessible Oath of Office , because they cover up the fact that the oath of office is between them and the IMF.\n22) The US Judges and US Attorneys are actually employees of the IMF and have expatriated out of the United States. They are now unregistered foreign agents under Title 22, which states all foreign agents must be registered.\n23) The court judgments are deposited with the IMF. Since this case obviously involves me, I have a drawing right to all proceeds. See UCC §3-305 and §3-306. The court judgments are monopolized according to Title 16, which is a violation of anti-trust laws, and also unfair trade practices.\n24) Indictments are True Bills, meaning they are negotiable instruments. The District Attorney failed to give me a 1099 OID showing me as the recipient of the funds, which is a fraud upon me. In my case, I have not been indicted, but still request a 1099 OID, unless the court wishes to close this account.\n25) The unlawful funds, through fraud and deception, are deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and they have not paid the tax on this income. According to the IRC, this is a §7201 of Title 26 violation (willful failure to file with the intent to evade the tax).\n26) A copy of the Depository Resolution Agreement was not made available to me from the Clerk of Court. The Clerk of Court makes deposits into the Federal Reserve Bank of New York via electronic funds transfers (EFT’s).\n27) The Clerk has a PMIA (Private Money Investment Account) is, which also has a government code. According to Clerks Praxis, the Clerk of the US District Court is the Registrar in Admiralty.\n28) According to the IRS §6209 Decoding Manual and the ADP (Automated Data Processing Manual), all 1099’s are Class 5 gift and estate taxes. I am asking for a 1099 OID in this case, as I am not willing to gift you the proceeds. I am hereby asking for the proceeds in their entirety, including interest.\n29) I have never pledged my rights or my body to any gifting program, including any court or court process.\n30) I am not a charitable organization. I demand all funds from the cases (current and past cases) be sent to me within 30 days or I will file complaints to the IRS and SEC explaining the fraud and theft committed upon me, and issue a 1099 OID.\n31) I demand my name and my cestui que trust name, John Doe/John S. Doe/John Smart Doe/ JOHNDOE/JOHN S. DOE/JOHN SMART DOE be removed from any and all government databases indicating bad credit, commercial liens and/or the titles of criminal, felon and/or convicted felon be removed immediately and permanently nunc pro tunc.\n32) I hereby request a copy of the Depository Resolution Agreement from the Clerk of Court. And a W-9 from the Judge and the US Attorney involved, if you wish to proceed with this case.\n33) I hereby notice the Court that I am the executor of the cestui que trust of JOHN DOE/JOHNSMART DOE. According to Title 26 §303 & §7701, companies, corporations, and associations and trusts are all decedents. This means my all capital letter name is a legal estate. My all capital letter name falls into this class. I direct all of the affairs and financial affairs of JOHNDOE/ JOHN S. DOE /JOHN SMART DOE.\n34) I demand this case/account be closed and no further steps taken to securitize it.\n35) I hereby ask the Court to notify local agents and agencies to put me on a do not disturb list so we do not have to go through this again.\n36) I am confident that the Court and its officers want to follow the law, and perhaps were unaware of the processes of civil and criminal cases.\n37) I expect no further harassment from rogue unregistered foreign agents.\nLETTER ROGATORY FOR RELIEF\npresented this the ____ day of ________, 2014.\n(_____Signature________________________)\nAuthorized Representative : John Smart Doe\nMail checks and correspondence to:\nPO Box \nLas vegas, Nevada 12345\n\n*****end copypasta****\n\n****BEGIN WITTY INSIGHTFUL CRITIQUE***** "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_901477979888135","body":"Perelman - The underrated genius. youtube.com The world's smartest man, who solved one of the biggest mysteries of mathematics and who decliend the Field's medal and the 1 million dollar paycheck that go...

Filing a lien on a trust you did not create and did not act as trustee for is inherently fraudulent because you’re demanding a debt from an entity that owes you nothing. If the US government decided to issue you a social security account number and thereby create a revocable living trust naming you the beneficiary, you have no grounds to file a lien on that trust. No commercial gain was had at your expense, even if the trust is identified based on the name of the cestui qui trust, such as using your name in all capital letters (e.g., JOHN WAYNE DOE).\n\n...

You will find the thread Here  ->[https://www.facebook.com/roguesupport.scott/posts/1223275807738889?comment_id=1223290467737423].  This is the first of several examples I'm going to use in this particular article.\n\nBefore I do, I'm going to establish some facts that people still seem to have a difficult time accepting, the first and foremost being that I am not one of you.  I am demonstrably different and/or better than you in every measurable way, and I demonstrate it time, and time, again.  I think more efficiently than you; and I know more than you.  To be painfully clear, this is something I demonstrate time, and time, again.  A sizable percentage of you will think I am \"arrogant\" for writing this.  Whereas here in reality, my distinction from the rest of you is a demonstrable and unavoidable fact.  You'll be required to keep that fact in your head as you read this article.  \n\nIn the aforementioned example we have the pleasure of dealing with some input from \"Mike Friesen\".  This exchange came up when he mentioned that he was \"a personal friend\" of Dean Clifford.  You will notice in that exchange, that he feebly tries to justify just how duplicitous he is in regard to this \"personal friendship\".  The dialogue in which illustrates that I, as a complete stranger on the Internet, show more respect for Mister Friesen than this \"personal friend\". \n\n Here's where my inherent difference from all of you comes in. This word \"friend\" that people use -- I don't think it means what they think it means.  \n\nYou can always measure the decay of a society's integrity be examining the court system.  It starts with members of the LAW SOCIETY referring to other members as \"my friend\".  It gets used in day-to-day conversation as part of your job; and every time it's used as part of your job, it's a lie.  Lying repeatedly about friends diminishes the meaning of the word; until in the end it's virtually meaningless.  Of course Mr. Friesen thinks I'm somehow in the wrong for pointing out this reality.  I'm thankful I haven't wasted any personal time with Mr. Friesen.  \n\nThe same cannot be said for Gail Marie. I was recently making fun of her ideas/site here [https://www.facebook.com/roguesupport.scott/posts/1223275807738889]  Gail Marie has lots and lots of \"friends\".  All of them say I'm \"mean\".  While Gail, on the surface, agrees with everything I\"m saying, she appears to be too cowardly to say so to her friends.  Because she doesn't want to hurt her \"friends'\" feelings, she has decided that \"rational\" is too mean, and has embraced New Age Woo and Psycho-Babble.  I even did a post about it so we could make fun of it.  It also led to a comprehensive ban on the word \"quantum\" throughout the fleet.  (Seriously...what is it with that word?)  You pay a price at the best of times, when you use words that you demonstrably don't know the meaning of...especially if you say those words to me.  I DO know what the words mean, and I will call out anyone who misuses them.  Especially if there's money involved.  Legalese is a massive forest of redefined words.  Many of you have become victims of this situation.  So why do you attempt to diminish and redefine the word, \"friend\"?  I literally treat strangers better than their friends treat them.  I've shown you proof in this article.  People keep trying to \"friend\" me; and I have over 400 \"followers\" which presumably are the people who tried to \"friend\" me (who are now my stalkers), plus the two or three cops that are left watching me (you guys know you were hired because you're stupid, right?).  All of the above do so for their own reasons, and all because I dare tell the truth.  \n\nWhy aren't your friends doing that?  I'll tell you why.  You keep bad company.\n\nYou think wrong, and you value the wrong things.  This is why the majority is always wrong.  It's the core mechanism.  You are taught from childhood that thinking wrong is a virtue, and valuing the wrong things is your duty.  If the majority thinks this way, what possible chance can they have of even stumbling on the right answer?  \n\nI don't set standards that are too high.  It's just that your \"friends\" lower the bar.  When I refuse to accept your diminished, diluted version of friendship, you get hostile because I won't accept that your pretend friend is the same as a real friend...and you don't want to accept the ugly reality that you don't have any real friends.  \n\n...And that you don't know anything.  \n\nSo far in the short miserable time on earth, the only one that has actually told you the truth, is some weird stranger on the Internet who is addressed as Admiral, thus revealing the final truth.  You're on your own, and you know nothing; and the ones who have answers do not have time for you.  \n\nI'm nearing the end of my time here in the public.  I'm in the last ninety days.  After that, I owe nobody, and you're all on your own.  As I've stated for three years now: \n\nIt doesn't matter how much you've learned\nIt doesn't matter how good it makes you feel\nIt doesn't matter if I have \"changed your life\"\nIt doesn't matter if you're \"grateful\"\n\n...We're still not \"friends\".  \n\nWhen I'm gone, these \"friends\" of yours will be all you've got.   They will return the same amount of value as they did before you \"discovered\" me; and they are why we can never, ever, be friends.  You keep bad company.   When strangers on the Internet give you more value than those you call \"friend\", I suggest you step back and take stock of your life.  For, despite what the Piece-of-Shit Christians say, you don't get another life after this one.   You're here for a short time, and your insignificant life has no meaning.  That is life's meaning.  The meaning of life, is to give life meaning.  \n\nFriends and loved-ones give life meaning.  I know I have to explain that, because none of your friends or loved-ones appear to be anything but meaningless.   I've watched the world's population double in my lifetime, and I'll probably observe this again.  A child born today will more likely be exposed to \"friend\" in the context of Facebook than they will in real life.   \n\nI knew what the Internet would become in the 1980's, as nay-saying friends and family will sheepishly admit.   Nobody around me could see it.  Children born today will never know a world without it.  I honestly thought at the time that when the Internet reaches its 2.0 phase, it will have elevated humanity.  I remember as a child, seeing Star Trek, and looking forward to the time where ignorance was no longer valued --where we all set out collectively to know more than we did before, where everyone was welcomed, everyone belonged, and where everyone knew how the technology worked.   Well it didn't really work out that way, did it?    I spent a lifetime preparing for a glorious future that, thanks to all of you, is now doomed never to happen - at least not within my lifetime.  \n\nI had true friends in the 80's, and I don't think I valued them as much as I should have.  In 1989, if you wanted a computer to work, you had to know everything about it.   Our collective quest for understanding mirrored that of Star Trek, and look what the computer scientists have delivered.   You live in the best of times, and the worst of times.   Kind of like Germany in 1933.  Only this time you have technology that could single-handedly defeat the allies, the Nazis and the Japanese all at once.   Your cell phone contains more computational power than existed on the planet during  World War II.  World War II was a time that friends were what kept you alive, and I've seen it form bonds that lasted decades.  My grandfather's coffin was carried by myself, my father, and my grandfather's friends.  I could see the pain of loss in these aged men's faces, and I can't help but think that people from that time were made of sterner stuff than we are.   Because now \"friend\" seems to be something you ask for on Facebook.   Your \"friendship\" can be removed with a single mouse-click.  \n\nLook around at those you call friend, and ask yourself why you consider them your friend.   Material benefit does not count.  Rich people tend not to have friends for that very reason.  Those are the only friends they get.   So why are your friends, your friends?  \n\nI've spent a lifetime studying the human condition.  Myself, and a few real friends, have spent the last twenty years attempting to decompile the human brain.  It would terrify you how much we know.  We all want to know, collectively as friends, and individually, how our meatware works; and not through pseudo-science like psychiatry or psychology.  \n\nI'm talking about actual science.  Computer science.  \n\nAs I write this, we as a species, are capable of tracking every single neuron in the brain through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the latest smart phone is more powerful than the computer performing the calculations on an MRI machine.  Seriously, this shit's five years away from being an app on your phone.  As far as we know, the human brain is the most complex thing in the galaxy.   We really are at the top of the food chain; and yet we can't retain the value of \"friend\".  \n\nEverything I've told you these past three years is the truth.  None of it is hidden, and it is easily verified.  This means you don't get to pick-and-choose the parts you agree with.   In short, if you think I'm wrong, you're wrong.\n\nWhen you realize that, you will find that I do not forgive people intentionally being wrong.  It didn't matter if you \"sincerely believed it\".  You were shown it was wrong by the only one who tells you the truth, and you deliberately ignored it.   From that point on, you formed the intent to be wrong.; and that is not anything I am under any obligation to forgive.  The prodigal son is an example of injustice and hypocrisy, and part of the reason I refer to Piece-of-Shit Christians as \"Piece-of-Shit Christians\".  The Prodigal Son is a stupid story.  I have explained why it's a stupid story, and I guarantee there's at least one Piece-of-Shit Christian reading this and thinking, \"I agree with a lot of what Scott says...but not that\".   This doesn't make me less right.  It's teaching Piece-of-Shit Christians that betrayal is ok, as long as you're sorry for it; after which you are entitled to just as much as those who actually did the work, and didn't fuck anyone around.   Seriously, what kind of a diseased mind adopts that as a value system?   It's the same diseased minds that think it's perfectly normal to be an adult with an imaginary friend. \n\nYou don't get to cherry-pick what I say, but it's of no consequence to me if you think there's value in clinging to delusion.  It's your time that's being wasted - not mine.   Everyone who took the time to listen to everything that I say, and accept everything I say as the truth/facts, could see what's coming, and they became very, very rich in the process.  They haven't squandered their new-found wealth.  \n\nI find myself in an odd position.  I'm farther ahead than I expected to be.  I'm approaching the half-century mark.  I was forced into a career where the life expectancy of the average male was 27 years.  I did not do that myself.  I did it because I had friends.  I had people who love me.  And I had ME, and that is an asset NOBODY else has.  \n\nI think right, and I value the right things.   I sacrificed everything, and live in a cage of my own making, to pay a debt to those friends, and to those who love me.  To those people I say, remember \"the plan\"; love outlasts death.  \n\nYou people tried to sell me a concept of \"friend\" where the recipient would barely be affected if you were to die tomorrow.   \n\nThis has been a profound experience for me.  Don't get me wrong.  Using a technology that didn't exist twenty years ago (which I understand intimately), people outside my strange, dark world, have actually penetrated it in good, and bad, ways.  People know the name, Derek Moran, as much as they know the name Pete Daoust.  I mention those two names because those names represent the biggest failure, and biggest success (in that order), in THE TENDER FOR LAW.   Pete dedicated 18 months to not only studying what I say, but in fact verifying what I say.  He has a unique advantage because, being a native French speaker, he is forced to translate English words.  Conversely, Derek Moran, doesn't have to translate what I say, and he has become a toxic virus that spreads everywhere, prompting people to worship clubhouse rules for a club in which they are not members.  Cows don't work for Burger King.  They're the product.  The same is true with the legal system.   Derek Moran tries to get people to worship these clubhouse rules, and the club in question isn't even bothering to follow them anymore.   That brings me to the NOTICE part:\n\nMy CONTRACTS and DEBTS to the ATTORNEY GENERAL expire in 2016.  Any NOTICES I give must be given within 20 days of that expiry, and I think I'm well within that window.  I hereby NOTIFY the ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ONTARIO, and those AGENTS therein who dared call themselves \"friend\", that I owe no DEBT to you now, and my obligations expire within the end of the year.  You have forfeited all RIGHT to negotiation or CONSIDERATION, and are hereby ORDERED to settle all CLAIMS by AQUILAE and/or its TRUSTEES before January 1st, 2016.   Should these debts not be settled by January 1st, 2016, I hereby CLAIM THE RIGHT to PUBLICLY DISCLOSE any and all interaction with the GOVERNMENT OF CANADA and/or the GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO by myself and/or JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN.   I hereby rescind any and all signatures binding myself and/or JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN to secrecy and/or non-disclosure.  I hereby CLAIM THE RIGHT to monetize any and all TESTIMONY regarding said obligations for non-disclosure and/or secrecy.   These terms are not open to negotiation.  \n\n...I digress.\n\nI wrote the above NOTICE because it's actually relevant to this.  I did a lot of great work, for a lot of the wrong things.  It wasted my 20's playing \"secret agent\", and all the while I was targeting the wrong people. People who could have helped.  I was very good at my job, because it turns out, the GOVERNMENT was smart enough to realize that I'd be too busy congratulating myself on how clever I was, to notice exactly what I was doing.  I ended up solving a lot of uncomfortable problems for them, and now you're paying the price.   For that, I can't be forgiven, but I can tell you the truth.  It doesn't matter if you like it.  It doesn't matter if you believe it; and in hindsight I realize I committed this horrible crime against you because I kept bad company.  \n\nSo like Ollie North I'm arming the Contras through ill-gotten gain (I even have the hot secretary), I consider my DEBT to all of you, PAID.  \n\nI expected at this point you'd be asking the right questions by now, but it seems I have VASTLY underestimated how much your ilk cherish your delusions and/or programming. \n\nBut even with that being true, I have demonstrably given you more than any \"friend\" ever did.   I don't have many friends, but the ones I do have I value, and they worked very hard for the title.   Can you say that about your \"friends\"?  \n\nTake a look at the company you're keeping.  Try to objectively analyze how your life would be affected if any of these \"friends\" were gone.   I'm mentioning this to show you what you've been robbed of, because what has been stolen from you by the LAW SOCIETY, is more than you're able to comprehend.   If I were to try to explain it to you, you wouldn't be able to understand it, because we don't have a common frame of reference.  I know the mechanism of your programming.  You don't.  You can't.  You ARE the program.  \n\nMore specifically you are the malware that robs you of actual thought.  You are the mechanism that tells you to value the wrong things, and it's as direct and invasive as robo-roach [https://youtu.be/EsrorUT_Svc]; and here is the irony - the roach is not capable of understanding that anything's happening to it.   Its brain simply lacks the complexity necessary to know the difference.  It doesn't experience \"mental trauma\", and with these wonderfully horrible products of computer science, you can literally \"drive a roach to death\". \n\nYou are NO different, in the Law Society's eyes.\n\n  I mention this because that's what your government wants for YOU; To be stupid, unaware, and valuing bullshit.\n\n They were doing just fine until this \"internet thing\" came up, and you were able to quickly exchange information.  As late as 1997, people were amazed that you could send an email half-way around the world for free.   Now it's \"officially\" a \"human right\".  You all take this amazing thing for granted.  Wars have trouble starting because information moves faster than the war machines.   This is something humanity has never had before; and allows me to stay somewhat relevant because I'm one of the few people left from the \"early days\" who knows what to do with all this shit, or how it all works.  \n\nStop keeping bad company.  They're killing you.  Stop accommodating delusion for the sake of \"friendship\".   \n\n...and stop pretending you weren't lied to.    Seriously, a stranger on the Internet should not be able to give you more value than your \"friend\".  \n\nTagged but can't talk? GOOD! You had your chance. Now you and your bullshit can just sit and read. Bullshit has no voice here. "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_888750434494223","body":"TRIPLE YOUR MONEY BACK!

Scanning.....scanning.....scanning nope, no injured party Joe Curtatone DROP THE CHARGES AGAINST THE SOMERVILLE 18: We are a nation founded upon and strengthened by a long history of social activism and protest—from the Boston Tea Party to the Freedom Marches for Civil Rights. When something is profoundly wrong in this nation, our citizens speak up and act up peacefully to set it right, and our freedoms—freedoms that are the envy of so many around the world—make this possible. \n\nThis January 18 protesters exercised those rights. In their pursuit of social justice and an end to the well-documented unequal and sometimes lethal treatment of blacks by our nation’s law enforcement system, they blocked I-93. They went beyond the usual sidewalk protest to be sure they would be heard, just as area police and firefighters did when they blocked our interstates and major roadways repeatedly in the early 1980s to protest layoffs. Back then, not a single firefighter or police officer was arrested for their actions. The Boston Police commissioner at the time demonstrated respect for their right to protest. He was right to do so. \n\nIf we allow the Somerville 18 to be treated differently today, we will all be in the wrong. There is no respect for the right to protest when the punishment proposed is completely disproportionate to the action taken. The news cycle has moved on for those inconvenienced by the traffic delays, but the Somerville 18 face excessive charges for that act of protest: 90 days in jail, nearly $15,000 in fines, and 18 months’ probation—this when peaceful protesters are commonly arrested but never even booked, or at most are given a small fine. \n\nThe irony of protesters against unequal treatment by the law enforcement system being treated unequally by the law should concern us all. It certainly concerned the 91 members of the clergy who this summer sent a clear message to District Attorney Marian T. Ryan: “As Black churches are burning across the country, as Black people are being killed by police, and as we honor the lives taken in Charleston, we are asking you to drop the charges against these people of conscience,” they wrote. \n\nIt is time for more political leaders to join our religious leaders in demanding fair treatment for the Somerville 18 as well, and I am adding my voice to that call here and now. The job of the District Attorney is a difficult one and we must respect the office’s ability to prosecute, but the ability to prosecute must be weighed against the question of whether or not justice is being done. We must hold injustice as more important than inconvenience. \n\nWith full respect, I ask District Attorney Ryan to drop the charges against the Somerville 18, and I would remind us all of Martin Luther King Jr.’s words about the role of the law during times of needed social change: “Law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.” "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_879077275461539","body":"From the freeman TMZ department:\n\n Dean Clifford EXPOSED by Alternative Media INSIDER !!! youtube.com Convicted criminal Dean Clifford has recently been exposed for the FRAUD that he is by alternative media personality, Cari-Lee Miller, formerly of \"Lifting t...

I tell them that I have received their NOTICE and THREATS.\n2). And apparently, I have a debt with them (I was NOT totally aware of who I was at that time :D )\n3). Assure them that IF I owe, I want to pay\n4). But I have NO ACCESS to Fiduciary Money ( Bank Notes) for the Moment\n5). I am SCARED that they cut the service, I have lots of children inside the house and your threats scares me very much :P\n6). Is there ANY other payment or remittance method AVAILABLE to me ? :D\n7). I OFFER to cut your grass and or wash your windows if it can help\n\nThat was the first letter :D and guess what ?  NO ANSWER, but PIERRE DAOUST got out of their collection department, oh the mystery !!!!, so I knew and felt that I was ONTO something, I have shared this in TTFL, and Scott Duncan said: You have NO IDEA how funny this is Pierre, and I replied, you’re right, I have no idea. \n\nApril 2013 shows up, I receive ANOTHER bill of exchange from them with some threats attach to it :D , I send the SAME exact letter, but I add on it: SECOND REQUEST :P\n\nAnd the same thing happen again….complete silence on their side, and PIERRE DAOUST don’t seems to be in their collection target.\n\nJuly arrived :D, I pick up a Bill of Exchange in PIERRE DAOUST’s mail box, and now, after reading and reading, and THINKING and THINKING….(I think more than I read), I know who I am :D …. And hit them with a NOTICE stating that this is the 3rd request I make, I am really disappointed about their complete silence, the BoE act tell that they HAVE to answer me, and they have 10 days to answer, or I will have to proceed with the comprehension I have, and they will have to accept :P\n\nNO ANSWER, so August the 6th, I have ADMINISTRATED and complete that Bill of Exchange, sent the original to Bank of Canada, and a copy to Hydro-Quebec.\n\nAnd then, September the 17th ( a Saturday morning), the phone’s ring, so I pick up the phone and say: HELLOSSS!!!! :D\n\nThat guy at the other end says: MISTER PIERRE DAOUST PLEASE, I said My name is Pierre, he said hi my name is so and so from Hydro-Quebec and I would like to answer your questions and help…. :D , I said OK, go ahead…HAHAHAHA!!!!, he said well, heuh, what’s you questions ?, I said do you have my communications I sent you via registered mail ?, he said one of them, I said have you read it ?, and the he started the SKATING fucking game, it was HILARIOUS, I have a recording of this, in French, and at one point I said wow wow wow, stop that please and send me all this in writing, he refused, he said he don’t have the RIGHT to send documents in writing, I said well, that is too bad :D\n\nAnyway, the day after, I wrote a beautiful letter :D ,  I tell them that one of their agent called the person I happen to have in my pocket, and tried to either fraud, confuse, or install some controversies in PIERRE DAOUST’s affairs, and from now on, I will ONLY accept ALL communications via mail.\n\nI said, If ever you want to REFUSE the administrating process I used, as the sole authorized ADMINISTRATOR for PIERRE DAOUST, you have to ADVISE me in writing AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\n\nI said, BANK of Canada, haven’t contacted me about any defect and/or refusal from their part.\n\nI said, if you need a copy of the audio recording of this phone calls for your file, I can send one to you via email :P\n\nyou have 10 days to NOTICE me of a fault, defect or refusal concerning the administration process of that bill of exchange, If I don’t hear from you, I will UNDERSTAND that this is settled and close :P\n\nNOTHING AS OF NOW !!!!\n\nI want to share this because, without really knowing it, I have used a very POWERFUL method in here…..think of that first letter I’ve sent back in January….you see, my INTENTS are good faith all the way….I am asking for the TRUTH…..tell me the fucking TRUTH, that’s all….and I have good reasons to believe that when you ask something, and they don’t answer, they have something to hide…….\n\nOh, I have started TEACHING other French Frogs about all this, they start seeing me in a more serious way :D , I mean, they can laugh, but it’s been 15 months I have not played the SURETY role for this hydro bill, and same thing with 5 other bills… :P\n\nAnd I am one heck of a good teacher :D , almost as much as I am a good administrator, \n\nThanks\nPete "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_883981791637754","body":"omg Omg OMG ZOMG...\n\n....It's time for another exciting round of...

Let's cover SURETY!\n\nOne of the most painful things about being on FaceBook is having to endure the fact that people with chronic Dunning–Kruger effect still think that their ignorance has the same standing as my knowledge; and they will happily state many unkind things regarding my character when I challenge their \"pulled-out-of-their-ass\" mythology.\n\nSome don't even go that far, and will simply lie about what I said, and claim I don't post evidence.  I don't have to post \"evidence\".  I'm not trying to PROVE anything to you.  \n\nThat said, this is not a debate centre either.  You assume ALL LIABILITY when you ask to join this group.  This, by default, means you have \"SURETY\", because SURETY equals LIABILITY.  I don't need to provide \"proof\" of this; as my banning you from the group should be compelling enough to show the difference between who's in charge, and who's liable. Who could even argue that? :D\n\nBefore we get to the actual issue of SURETY, and why you must avoid it, we must take a quick journey back in time to learn where the legalese that enjoins you came from.  \n\nThose of you who endured the content-free 1.2 decades of the Public Fool System, will remember certain things, not the least of which is Shakespeare.  The plays of Shakespeare are sold to you as \"Olde English\".  In fact, it was sold as \"Olde English\" when these were first-run plays.  There is a problem with this, though.  Nobody ever spoke in the manner that Shakespeare wrote, and they most certainly never used the words.  Shakespeare produced most of his major works between 1589 and 1613, all of which were sold as \"Olde English\".  Popular periodicals of the time show that you were often considered \"learned and of good taste\" if you could speak in this \"Olde English\".  \n\nSo let's go read some really, really Olde English.\n\nLet's pick a really old English document, completely at random.  We'll pick...The MAGNA CARTA.  \n\nA quick read of any translation of (Originally all British Law was written in LATIN) the MAGNA CARTA will swiftly reveal two things.  The first is that that it's pretty readable, not backward and convoluted like a Shakespeare play.  There may be a few archaic words you may need to look up (to ascertain their meanings), but it's still pretty readable, and there are no words that Shakespeare used.  There's also no letter \"U\".  This is a very important fact to remember, because *spoiler alert*, when courts or legal documents refer to \"YOU\", they are in fact, granting you SURETY in the matter.  If you look at a WARRANT, or a ticket from a Policy Enforcement Officer, it will have a name and it will then refer to that name as \"YOU\" from then on.  For example, \"JOHN Q PUBLIC, YOU have been charged with (insert bullshit offence here)\".\n\nYOU=SURETY\n\nIf you're ever in a courtroom and do not wish to have the \"benefit of SURETY\", you have but to object to being addressed as \"YOU\".  There are many ways to do this.  Dean Clifford might say, in response to being addressed as \"YOU\", \"If I have led the court to believe that I am SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE.  Please forgive me.\" (FUN FACT: A court MUST ALWAYS grant forgiveness when asked and/or requested)\n\nOthers, like myself, are a lot more succinct.  For example, I might respond, \"FUCK YOU!  You're a YOU, I'm a ME!  By what AUTHORITY do YOU address ME as a \"YOU\"?\", because I can get away with it.  The reason I can get away with it is that I UNDERSTAND the UCC as opposed to ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD which spreads mythology and bullshit about the UCC.\n\nNow there may be a certain \"pretend radio\" talk-show host (who speaks in a manner that would suggest he is hosting a show with a dick in his mouth), who would demand \"proof of this\", ignoring the fact that the UCC is, in fact, the proof.\n\nSection 1, Subsection 308, of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE covers RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.   This is a well-known fact, and this is how you use it. \n\nOn entering the court, you aggressively make the first motion, that being, the RESERVATION OF YOUR RIGHTS.  But since you're the only one in the courtroom with ACTUAL STANDING, you can be a total dick about it.  You don't RESERVE YOUR RIGHTS, you RESERVE ALL RIGHTS!  Not just yours, EVERYONE's.  You remove everyone else's rights and give them to yourself.  WHY?  Because \"Fuck off that's WHY!\"  You're the only one with STANDING.\n\nIf you HOLD the power, WIELD it...don't be such a pussy!  If you're entitled to ALL RIGHTS, CLAIM THEM.  This is how you do it.\n\nWhen the \"justice\" starts speaking, interrupt them.  Say, \"Point of order!\"  They will immediately be silent.  At that point, state \"I believe I am the only party with standing, so barring objection from the court, I wish to RESERVE ALL RIGHTS now, and henceforth.  Are there any objections from the court?\"  As the court has no standing to respond, simply speak to the record as such, \"Let the record show that I have reserved all rights, and the court has not objected.\"  At this point if they say anything to you, you simply say, \"Objection.  The record shows that I have reserved all rights, and I have not granted you leave to speak.  Why are you speaking?\" \n\nDo the same when opposing counsel attempts to speak.  You will then be posed the question, \"How do you wish to proceed in this matter?\" for that is the one question a slave has the right to ask.  What is their master's wish?  \n\nYou'll recall in other articles and comments, the levels of the caste system and how they give instructions.  \n\nNOBILITY (KINGS AND QUEENS) EXPRESS THEIR \"WISHES\".\n\nADMIRALTY ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS BY REQUESTING, ADDRESSING THEIR SUBORDINATES AS \"MR\".\n\nGENERALS GIVE ORDERS.\n\nNow even the talk-show host who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth, won't \"demand proof\" of the fact that if you have all the rights, and everybody else has none, you are CLEARLY the KING.  So you are going to have to learn to give instruction by expressing your wishes.  This is why they are asking how you \"wish to proceed\".  Courts grant and test your SOVEREIGNTY all the time.  You simply have to listen to the words they are using.  At this time you may respond, \"I wish to prove to some ass-wipe who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth, the things I know, so I wish to go to trial PRO SE.  But I wouldn't recommend this...I would simply wish the case to be dismissed.\n\nIf they say anything else besides \"I agree, case dismissed\", you exercise your AUTHORITY by questioning.  MASTERS QUESTION, SLAVES ANSWER.  For instance if a \"justice\" said anything except \"I agree. Case dismissed,\" you question why they are even speaking.  \"I'm sure you'll recall Mr. (insert justice's name here) that at the beginning of these proceedings I explicitly reserved all rights, including yours. Have I not made my wishes clear?\"  \n\nAlways remember to respond in the form of a question.  A question serves the dual-purpose of establishing your authority, and negating the possibility of UNDERSTANDING; because if you UNDERSTAND, you accept SURETY.\n\nAs stated before, the most powerful of these questions is, \"Who are you?\"  UNDERSTANDING cannot be presumed until that question is answered.  \n\nAbove all, questioning deflects SURETY.\n\nQuite possibly one of the most useful documents I have ever published is my NOTICE OF MISTAKE for Dean.  This is a useful, powerful document that also instantly removes SURETY.  I framed it in such a way that you can replace the name \"Dean Clifford\" with your name, and you can make a pad of these things.  Have lots of copies to hand out to friends and opposing counsel.  Hell the court clerk loves these things too...make sure the court clerk has one as well.  Just make sure you UNDERSTAND what the document says.  Read it carefully and understand what the words mean, because you will be challenged.  And remember, the NOTICE by its very nature, presents several questions.\n\nDo not permit the proceedings to move forward without these questions being answered!  \n\nBecause so many people ask for it, transcribed here is the copy of THE ROGUESUPPORT NOTICE OF MISTAKE.\n\n***Begin NOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nIn the matter of SURETY for the LEGAL NAME, I believe that there has been a\nMISTAKE as the SOLE BENEFICIARY has been INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED as the\naccused. If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR\nSUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led the COURT to believe\nby responding to “You” and or “DEAN CLIFFORD” and/or SUCH OTHER\nIDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am the PARTY\nWITH SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE and please forgive\nme.\n\nAs I have no knowledge of who “You” and or “DEAN CLIFFORD” and/or SUCH\nOTHER IDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, I RESPECTFULLY\nASK; by WHAT AUTHORITY is the COURT ADDRESSING me as such?\nAs the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT,\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I, as the SOLE BENEFICIARY of the\nTRUST have any SURETY in this matter?\n\nAs the GOVERNMENT is the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY on the SURETY BOND\n(BIRTH CERTIFICATE), with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL\nNAME, WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE for the\nLEGAL NAME. WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE and\nhave ANY SURETY with respect to the LEGAL NAME?\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a\nTRUSTEE or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN?\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the\nprincipal?\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that there has been any meeting of the\nminds, any PROPER NOTICE given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or\nthat I have ANY INTENT to CONTRACT in this matter?\n\nAs such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and\nCLOSURE.\nAUTHORISED BY:\n\n***End NOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nIf you truly UNDERSTAND what this document says and/or does, this is one of the most powerful documents you can wield in court.  If you have the Dunning–Kruger effect you will likely go to jail.  Used properly the NOTICE OF MISTAKE will ALWAYS remove any real or implied SURETY the court believes you may have.  \n\nYou will notice the court always refers to \"belief\".  When I say belief is evil, it is not just a disparaging remark against adults with \"imaginary friends\" (which they totally deserve), it is yet another example of why this statement is profoundly true.  All belief is evil.\n\nYou are taught from childhood to \"respect belief\", and are constantly reinforced with the really dumb freedom that it is your \"right to believe what you want\".  If I had the authority and/or power to remove just one right from humanity, and no more, the right to \"believe\" would be the one that I would eradicate.  In all my years of studying, and being part of the Nobility, the curtailing of this one \"RIGHT\" would exponentially increase quality of life for all humanity.  I calculate it would take two generations for it to \"stick\".\n\nBelief is the end of questioning.  Belief is intellectual bankruptcy, and is the exact opposite of knowledge.  You will never question if you \"believe\".  \n\nLet's leap back to the 1500's to Shakespeare.  This is where the concept of addressing somebody as \"YOU\" indicated the assignment of SURETY.  No writings before this contained any such logistic mechanisms.  Don't \"believe me\"...go look for yourself.  Go look at the MAGNA CARTA yourself; and ask yourself why there's no \"YOU\" before Shakespeare.  And ask yourself why the MAGNA CARTA, in all its current published forms, no longer has, \"To do right by Alexander\".  \n\nThere may be three readers amongst you who understand what I just said there, and all of them are Scottish I guarantee you.  \n\nIn any courtroom proceeding in the western world, SURETY IS PRESUMED, and it must be deflected from you.  As a \"justice\" is not a PERSON under the law, the only PARTY that can ACCEPT SURETY is the PARTY making the CLAIM.  \n\nThere may be certain readers who talk like they have a dick stuck in their mouth, who will demand proof of this...and so I direct you to the Rules of Civil Procedure (wherever you are) to look up SECURITY FOR COSTS.  \n\nLet's zoom back to the present (so we can get as far away from belief as possible) where the word \"YOU\" is part of the English language, as are the titles, \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", and \"Mrs.\".  All of these titles and means of addressing you, are in fact, assigning and/or presuming SURETY...yes, on YOU.  The easiest mnemonic exercise you can do to make deflecting these titles second nature is to replace the titles \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", or \"Mrs.\" with the word, \"bitch\", in your head; and to respond as if they had addressed you as \"bitch\", because being addressed as \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", or \"Mrs.\" is doing exactly that.  \n\nAs for the word \"YOU\", think of that as a tennis ball which must be served back.  Assert your AUTHORITY by questioning whenever they address you as \"YOU\"; \"Are YOU addressing ME?\"  If they're stupid enough to say yes, or even to imply the affirmative, be like that guy who talks like he has a dick in his mouth and demand proof; \"By what authority do YOU address me as a PARTY OF SURETY?\"...or something along those lines.  Your only objective is to serve the \"YOU\" back to them.\n\nSo that's today's word, \"SURETY\".  It's something you don't want, and I've just shown you how to give it back.  I'd like to thank my involuntary guests, Dean Clifford, and the guy that talks like he's got a dick in his mouth.  Since I was so liberal with their identities, I certainly have no problem putting in a free plug for a \"pretend radio\" show.\n\nSo here's a link to Dean Clifford talking about family court rules or something...hosted by a guy who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth.

You see, my friends, COURTESIES are for COURTESANS, because THEY'RE THE ONES GETTING FUCKED. If you ACCEPT a COURTESY, you accept that you're the one getting fucked. I can't put it any simpler. This is why you NEVER accept courtesies from the government.\n\nThe GOVERNMENT is not a PERSON.\n\nThe COURT is not a PERSON.\n\n...and if you accept a courtesy from the court, you are putting it on the PUBLIC RECORD that in ALL LEGAL EXCHANGES, YOU'RE THE ONE GETTING FUCKED!\n\nA GIFT, on the other hand...\n\n... is exactly what you think it means.\n\nDigressing from the spoiler alert (because when I “spoil” it's hard core), and returning to the NOTICE, I shall now discuss the practical aspects of PROPER NOTICE. We'll start with one of the simplest notices:\n\nKEEP OFF THE GRASS.\n\nIs this PROPER NOTICE?\n\nYes it is, however the LEGAL strength of this notice is dependent on WHERE THE NOTICE IS. The terms of the notice, “KEEP OFF THE GRASS”, is far different for a PUBLIC PARK than say, for example... A HOUSE FULL OF RUSSIAN MOBSTERS. Ignoring the NOTICE has DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES depending on WHERE IT IS. If you are going to wield LAW, your NUMBER ONE GOAL SHOULD BE TO REMOVE VARIABLES, and I have just described a big one!\n\nHow do you remove this variable?\n\nLet's look at another PUBLIC NOTICE that all of us have seen.\n\nNO PARKING\n\nOn the surface, “NO PARKING” and “KEEP OFF THE GRASS” are functionally the same, however, unlike “KEEP OFF THE GRASS”, a “NO PARKING” sign will also give you notice as to WHO PUT IT THERE. This removes the variables that “KEEP OFF THE GRASS” has.\n\nWe have removed the question as to WHO is saying this, and as a byproduct, the consequences of ignoring the notice. As I've mentioned throughout the TENDER FOR LAW, the question “WHO are you?” puts the court in the most jeopardy. Identifying WHO you are when giving a notice creates what's called “PROPER NOTICE”. The primary goal of a LEGAL document is to remove all possible variables to accomplish its goal. “NO PARKING” is pretty specific. It reduces the variables to “PARKED”, and “NOT PARKED”. “NOT PARKED” is the GOAL of the notice. “PARKED” is something to be discouraged.\n\nIf it is a TRUST and not a PERSON WHO posts the NOTICE, it is what is known as a BY-LAW. This means that should you choose (of your own free will) to interact with the TRUST, you are subject to the BY-LAWS. TRUST LAW is the HIGHEST LAW. It trumps ADMIRALTY LAW. It trumps CANON LAW. It is the HIGHEST LAW.\n\nThus endeth the preamble. Let's draw us up a NOTICE.\n\nIn this particular case a VESSEL has been LAWFULLY transferred to the AQUILAE TRUST.\n\nAs this VESSEL is NOT in AQUILAE's custody, a PUBLIC NOTICE must be given laying CLAIM to the VESSEL. This permanently curtails any SALVAGE RIGHTS on said VESSEL. If you construct a VESSEL it is VERILY YOUR RIGHT to transfer ownership of said VESSEL, but one must remember, one does not own the SOUL of the VESSEL, and should the SOUL speak, their word is LAW. If you want to find this LAW, you have only to look in the CAPTAIN's Log; for the CAPTAIN is the SOUL in question.\n\nNow like every other LEGAL document, the first line on the LEGAL document MUST state what the document is.\n\nCERTIFICATES, BONDS and NOTES are often mistakenly called LEGAL DOCUMENTS, when their actual LEGAL status is, “VALUABLE INSTRUMENT”. It's not “LEGAL INSTRUMENT” because “LEGAL” does not indicate VALUE. The name itself, says what it is; an INSTRUMENT you can attach VALUE to. But we're not dealing with “VALUABLE INSTRUMENTS”, because we are transferring this VESSEL from the LOWEST LAW (ADMIRALTY) to the HIGHEST LAW (TRUST). This pulls it out of the ADMIRALTY JURISDICTION.\n\nI'm sure some of you are putting this together already, so I'll just give away the ending, because I'm a total dick that way.\n\nIn ADMIRALTY, on land, you are considered a “VESSEL” in dry dock. You're not a corporation, you're a boat in the eyes of ADMIRALTY LAW. You are a VESSEL “ON-THE-HARD” in marine slang. If you are ever in a marina you will notice that the marina leaves everybody who is docked, alone. They won't speak to the CAPTAINS unless spoken to, and the CAPTAINS are given the utmost respect...\n\n...until they pull your boat out of the water.\n\nWhen the VESSEL is “ON-THE-HARD” you are now in the marina's “CUSTODY”, and your STATUS is very, very, different; and this, above all, is why you treat the HARBOUR MASTER with the highest respect. My experience has shown that doing this ALWAYS pays off...\n\n...but I digress.\n\nLet's construct the first line of our document.\n\nThe first line of the document MUST state WHAT IT IS.\n\nSince this is intended to be a PUBLIC NOTICE, it makes sense that “PUBLIC NOTICE” be the first line. There is now no confusion as to what this document IS, and WHO it is . It is not addressing a particular INDIVIDUAL. This means if you give a PUBLIC NOTICE to an INDIVIDUAL, you are DEEMED to have done so as a COURTESY. You've already read the spoiler so I'm not building the plot up.\n\nAs a courtesy, a copy of this PUBLIC NOTICE (with some redacted shit filled in) will be sent by registered mail to a LAWYER who mistakenly BELIEVES he/she/it has INTEREST in the VESSEL. As an extra COURTESY, a copy of the LIEN on the VESSEL will be included, because we at AQUILAE, if nothing else, are very, very, COURTEOUS.\n\nThe next line in any LEGAL DOCUMENT must list any PARTIES being referred to. Since this is a PUBLIC NOTICE there are no PARTIES to list. Therefore PUBLIC NOTICE meets all LEGAL obligation.\n\nAfter this point in the document, all UNDERTAKINGS must be listed.\n\nSo if I posted a PUBLIC NOTICE, I am, in fact, POSTING A BILL. A BILL is also a TENDER FOR LAW. When you receive a BILL for your meal, your ACCEPTANCE makes it LAW.\n\nWhen you give an ORDER, you have pre-accepted the LAW, and the BILL is simply a FORMality (Everybody GET THAT?).\n\nA BILL in PARLIAMENT is supposedly ordered by the CITIZENS, or “DEEMED ORDERED” by the CITIZENS. This is why the phrase, “POST NO BILLS”, is often found on temporary structures with flat surfaces. “POST NO BILLS” = “POST NO TENDERS FOR LAW”; This means you have been PROPERLY NOTIFIED (PROPER NOTICE because a BILL is a TENDER FOR LAW).\n\nTHERE ARE NO HOMONYMS IN LAW\n\nTHERE ARE NO SYNONYMS IN LAW\n\nFor instance, BILL C1,1985 is a BILL nobody accepted, simply because there's no sane person that would accept, THE INCOME TAX ACT.\n\nThis act has been AMENDED MANY, MANY TIMES, but has never been ACCEPTED into LAW, and like the deluded Christians you'll find on Dean's Facebook page, the GOVERNMENT will pretend not to know this, and will IGNORE/ATTACK those who point it out or give PROPER NOTICE.\n\nThis is one of the dirtiest “hidden-in-plain-sight” secrets in LAW. The Income Tax Act that was once LAW, for the purpose of paying for the war, expired DECADES AGO, and people just kept paying.\n\nThey govern these PAYMENTS OF IGNORANCE through an OUTSOURCED THIRD-PARTY. Douglas Levitt didn't come into my home with a gun. Cowards don't do that, and ALL LAWYERS ARE COWARDS. These are strangers who harm people for money. Only cowards choose such a profession. If they wish to inflict violence, they outsource to a third-party, and pay them...\n\nWhere was I? OH YES! I remember...\n\nTHEREFORE having received PROPER NOTICE (PROPER NOTICE = KNOWLEDGE under LAW), you now KNOW that, should you POST a TENDER FOR LAW, it is NOT REASONABLE TO BELIEVE your TENDER FOR LAW will be there at a LATER TIME.\n\nHowever in our case, we are going to POST our PUBLIC NOTICE by way of the POSTAL SERVICE.\n\nThe POSTal SERVICE (Everybody GET THAT?)\n\nThe POSTAL SERVICE is a service provided for POSTING TENDERS FOR LAW. So when you send a REGISTERED letter via the POSTAL SERVICE, this service also BEARS WITNESS (and gives a RECEIPT for it) to the fact that NOTICE was posted to a specific PARTY.\n\nNow; In the interest of time, I shall now draw out that PUBLIC NOTICE, because the PARTY I'm drafting the document for, is wondering why I'm not on the phone with him right now, drafting it with him.\n\nDrafting documents in public is a lot like fucking in public. Many parties will consider it in bad taste, some might even find it disgusting, but in the end it rarely happens, and it's fun to watch.\n\nWhat? Am I wrong?\n\nSo let's draft this document RIGHT NOW.\n\n***BEGIN***\n\nPUBLIC NOTICE\n\nTAKE NOTICE that the VESSEL known as ***redacted shit here*** is now the LAWFUL PROPERTY of the AQUILAE TRUST per the wishes of ***redacted shit here***'S CREATOR and GRANTOR.\n\nTherefore: LET IT BE KNOWN THAT AS OF THIS DATE, BEING FEBRUARY 18, 2013, THE VESSEL KNOWN AS ***redacted shit here*** MUST BE CONSIDERED A PRIVATE VESSEL WITH NO COMMERCE EXPECTED AND/OR IMPLIED.\n\nPARTIES ATTEMPTING TO USE ***redacted shit here*** FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES MAY BE FINED AT THE RATE OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY ($5,000 PER DAY) OR ANY PART THEREOF, FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE.\n\nQuestions regarding this NOTICE may be addressed to the DULY AUTHORIZED TRUSTEE CORPORATION, [ROGUESUPPORT INC.] at (416) 994-1700.\n\nAQUILAE TRUST SEAL (Insert lower right)\n\n***END***\n\nAnd there's everything you need for A NOTICE.\n\nViewing women who are “lubed up” by this awesomeness are, of course, invited to drop by for a ride. Extra points if you show up in a “Naughty Schoolgirl” outfit. "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_863595460343054","body":"Funny how NOBODY seems to grasp what a DISTRICT is.

I think it was Pete Daoust who mentioned it.\n\nAnyways, today I was off to get a document notarized myself. I have had little experience with the notary process, and what experience I have had, was with guys whose primary occupation is that of a lawyer. They seem to have the notary market locked down pretty good. Those few times I have had it done, it was about 40 bucks per document as an average. These lawyers also seem to want to read everything I've written as if they are being asked for their opinions or something.\n\nBut, as I was on my way to this new notary, I had to walk past this public building that had the words TOWN HALL on the front of it. I decided to go in and ask if perhaps they had a Public Notary in that public building... They did! The Secretary tells me that although he is not in today, he does notarize documents, and there is no charge.\n\nThat guy is not listed in the phone book, so I thought I'd mention it to you all.

I have used THE TENDER FOR LAW to effectively give you, and the rest of the world, a whole shit-load of NOTICE.  \n\nThree years is a long time, and many incredible things have happened; and it's all unfolding in different perspectives depending on how long you're known me.  People who have known me for decades are screaming, \"How the fuck could he have known?\"  Of those people, the farther they are away from computer science, the more likely they are to reach for the \"lucky guess\" option.  Others will try to make it seem as though I was somehow \"less right\"; or my personal favorite, \"You were right...so what?\"  The thing is that if you are having this quandary in your empty little head, it means there has already been a discussion, and you don't get to back-peddle, and say I was sort-of right; and in these coming days I will be expecting all of you to step-the-fuck-up when needed.\n\nThe Law Society is most frightened of the coming of 2016.  This is when I start selling my debts.  Like the Chinese buying trillions of dollars of worthless US debt, I have literally hundreds of people who owe everything that they are, and have, to me.  The price I exact in exchange is always a small one.  What is, or will be asked, may seem nothing to you - but it's everything to me - or I wouldn't have shown you how to get everything you wanted.  There are a disturbing number of people who think that they can diminish my role now that the debt is coming due, claiming to have \"done all the work\", and completely ignoring the fact that they would be no farther ahead without me.  Without me they would never have known the life they have now.\n\nIt's the strangest thing, but throughout my life I've encountered countless people who think it's acceptable to do these very things; but as I've also noticed, I'm prepared either way.  You just have farther to fall.  \n\nTo those who owe me a debt that I did not CONSENT to, you have until the end of the year to make reparations.  After that I shall sell the debt to any number of the aforementioned people who have become very rich using what I have taught them.  They are going to want to collect off of you, and when they do, remember - it's all \"perfectly LEGAL\".  \"There is a court order\", and they're \"just doing their jobs\", no matter how loud you may scream.  \n\nIn 2016 I go from privateer to pirate, and so do all my ships.  Guess what...we've prepared for that too.  Thereafter, I'll still be available.  I'll have to be.  I'll be providing a planetary-scale example of AGENCY.  Like the conductor of an orchestra I'm not playing any of the instruments.  I'm not making any noise, but you're not doing any of these things until I say so; and you will do them as, and how, I say.  \n\nI have demonstrated in the public eye what I am capable of, and if you look carefully you'll see I showed you how to do the same thing. I don't hoard power, I make sure everybody has it.  I've given you all you need to construct lifeboats for what is to come, and I'm off to build my \"Rocket to Utopia\".  \n\nTo those not paying attention, that was a 'Doctor Who' reference mocking the police.  This past year seeds were planted and companies sprung to life, all managed through AGENCY.  You couldn't connect me to them if you tried, but now I need more people using the new technology so I can blend in.  I need some plausible deniability, and a monopoly on knowledge does not serve me.  The 'war on wrong' is being waged on all fronts.  With each passing day, fewer and fewer of my first wave pioneers are calling me for direction.  They know what they're doing, and they know why they're doing it.  In fact I'm sure the last two queries were just some misguided attempt to make me feel relevant.  What I have given them consumes their life, so it is beyond their comprehension that I could be, and know, so much more.  I just smile and say, \"You've got your scales wrong\".  \n\nThose are my successes, but I have plenty of failures as well.  Whether not moving fast enough to keep up, or simply loving bullshit too much, the cause is irrelevant; and all of you are the same.  It's like there's some other teacher out there, telling you how to square it in your empty, little, heads.  You'll rationalize it with, \"I didn't waste his time; he wasted MY time\".  All of you say exactly the same thing, and if that's really how you want to rationalize it - that way, to protect whatever bullshit you love so much - then remember this public statement.  No matter what happens, you will never have moved one inch farther than the point at which I left you.  Then you can join the masses who say, \"There is no way he could possibly have known\", or \"It's just a lucky guess\"; but it won't protect you from what's coming.  I am still going to change everything!  Why do I know this with such certainty?\n\n...because I did all the work when everybody thought I was wasting my life - so much work that government plebes can't find it all. \n\nUnfortunately 2016 is also when people start taking me seriously, and that's all right too, because I'm already done \"building\".  Now the world is my playground, and if you see me playing in my sandbox, stay the fuck AWAY!  For, according to government \"intelligence\" I'm a \"mentally-ill computer operator\".  This suits me just fine.  I love the \"mental illness\" designation.  You see, that designation is a LEGAL designation.  No doctor has the AUTHORITY to declare you LEGALLY insane.  In fact, doctors only issue to the courts, opinions and recommendations; and here's the fun part.  \n\nIt all starts in the early days of C.P.I.C.  There are some technical terms I'm about to use here, and Wikipedia entries will be at the bottom.  Shortly after the Charter was enacted, rules were set for how \"criminal records\" were to be entered and/or stored.  So today's technical word that you're learning is \"schema\", a term you will hear often in conjunction with RELATIONAL DATABASES.  The combination of an application and a well-constructed schema, allows you to implement RULES for how the data is managed after it is created.  This means a designation such as \"mentally ill\" can have certain instructions attached to it.  This one has a very simple one; once you turn it on, you cannot turn it off.  This will make a notation on all \"criminal records\", and a set of three alerting asterisks bracketing the words, ***CONDITION: MENTALLY ILL***.  The reason I mention this is that it must appear in any DISCLOSURE.  The Crown is obligated by law to produce any exculpatory evidence, and a police record with \"CONDITION: MENTALLY ILL\" on it, means there is evidence I am not criminally accountable for my actions.  In fact, the reason it's in the Crown disclosure package in the first place, is to make it a FACT IN EVIDENCE - which it becomes when you ACCEPT the DISCLOSURE.  \n\n...I digress.\n\nThe point here is that, once you flip on the mentally-ill label, the very nature of how the data is stored negates the possibility of removing it.  In fact, all records of all police departments in CANADA, use the same standardized system - and it's hysterical.  Some clever entrepreneur knew that there was no better place to leverage ignorance than the public sector, and this \"guy\" manged to sell every surplus NeXT computer every built...and that piece-of-crap formed the backbone of police \"intelligence\" from 1990 onward.  I actually ACCEPTED an ARREST WARRANT in the WebCapades v. Duncan case, to get an idea of what they'd replaced it with.  This is why GOVERNMENT doesn't like me wandering around their buildings.  It takes me about ten minutes of casual observation to identify how every piece of technology works.  In short, around me, you've got no secrets to tell.  WebCapades v. Duncan was 2003.  I failed to ponder the Herculean ineptitude in play.  The stupid Gomer behind the counter was cursing because his early 90's NeXT station wasn't performing to manufacturer's specifications.  I kicked myself for a month.  A perfectly flawless reconnaissance presents real-world evidence that I have vastly overestimated my opponent.  It's a lesson none of us seem to learn.  We all have these interactions with LAW and GOVERNMENT thinking that just beyond the next supervisor, is somebody who actually has an idea what's going on, and this is not the case.  The DEPUTY DIRECTOR for the ATTORNEY GENERAL is only different from the douche at the counter at the ATTORNEY GENERAL's OFFICE in that one has maneuvered himself into a powerful position - the other has not.  So if you're looking for that smart government supervisor who understands all the issues, you're never going to find them.  People work for the GOVERNMENT (especially the ATTORNEY GENERAL) because they're not wanted in the real world.  Walk into any part of government service, any part, and I guarantee that there are at least three people related to one another there.  In these progressive days, their first language is from a country that speaks neither English nor French.  It's more diverse cronyism and nepotism; but they're all parasites.  Some of them know they're parasites and will make concerted effort to ensure the host isn't damaged too much, but in 2015 virtually every government worker thinks they have more rights than you do; and they think they own you, and that it's their \"LEGAL RIGHT\" to kidnap/harm/rob/murder you.  \n\nMy grandfather warned me about police states.  When he was explaining it to me, he was mostly concerned that I memorize the information for reference later.  I was thirteen and I didn't have much focus.  I was still young enough to answer my questions with, \"I need to learn more\".  I've always learned the most from finding the things that people who claim to have my best interests at heart, didn't want me to know.  Here's the thing about not being criminally accountable for your actions (which I was at thirteen).  It's very difficult to give up when the passage of some arbitrary date occurs.  Why did I go from the superior title of 'Master' to the subordinate title of 'Mister'?  Who made that decision?  It is dangerous questions such as this, that guided my entire course through life.  \n\nSo if you're fortunate enough to be \"mentally ill\", just remember it's the LEGAL NAME they're DECLARING mentally ill - not you.  This means you immediately CLAIM the RIGHT to ACT as AGENT for this \"mentally ill magic parchment\".  You can explain to the COURT how \"there's plenty of 'tards out there living really kick-ass lives\"; because if mental illness is a FACT in LAW, then it is FRAUD to attach SURETY.  The two things the COURTS MUST RECOGNIZE are MISTAKE, and FRAUD.  NOTICE OF FRAUD works exactly the same way as NOTICE OF MISTAKE, only instead of MISTAKE, it's FRAUD.  See how that works?  If FRAUD is on the RECORD, you cannot CONVICT.  FRAUD on the RECORD is, by it's very nature, REASONABLE DOUBT.  It is not reasonable to FORGIVE FRAUD.  The onus is always on you to show why you should not forgive MISTAKE.  The COURT is bound by this as well.  But the onus is completely reversed as regards FRAUD.  You are under no obligation to forgive FRAUD, and the onus is on the COURT to disprove FRAUD.  \n\nOne of the oldest tactics that the GOVERNMENT uses, they learned from the piece-of-shit Christians.  If you question authority, they call you 'crazy'.  So let them.  They are trying to diminish the value of the SECURITY in order to 'reclassify' you; except if you're smart you've already LIENED your name as recommended by \"Dan-Lien-Your-Name-Wilson\".  So not only is this SECURITY 'mentally ill', it's got a multi-million dollar LIEN on it.  There's not much equity we had here, and anyone who has LIENED their name, is by their very nature, going to put up a fight.  NOTICE OF MISTAKE is a passive resistance to the psychopaths in 'Thunder Dome', and those wanting to up-their-game in COURT can take their understanding of NOTICE OF MISTAKE and duplicate it with NOTICE OF FRAUD; let's see how this is handled when the BURDEN OF PROOF is on the COURT.  \n\nI hope this is a nice piece of civil disruption for you.  It's also where we're introducing what will become your greatest weapon - the 'Civil Disruption' domain.  It has been standing, waiting, since the late 90's: cdd.com.\n\ncdd.com won't do much at first.  It'll provide a few static pages and a few routing tools you won't understand.  It will, however, possess something that those who have been following WILL understand.  The Civil Disruption Domain will host a Diaspora Pod.  Some of you have been paying attention, and are lurking on Diaspora (don't think I don't see you).  Others forgot all about it.  Meanwhile a whole bunch of goodies have been developed in the back end, including, but not limited to, Diaspora wallets, Diaspora markets, Diaspora IPV6 gateways; and of course, for those on the Civil Disruption Domain, there will be their own personalized I2P Domain.  It is with the deepest, heaviest heart that I regret to tell you that \"Dan-Lien-Your-Name-Wilson.cdd.com\" is reserved so you can't use that one.  We're looking at a launch date in August, and here's the part that really makes me grit my teeth: only TENDER FOR LAW members can join!  I only need this site running for a year.  By then I2P addresses will be saturated and cdd.com will belong to everyone.  That's a blurry map for things to come.  After 2016 I am a hundred percent dependent on my fleet.  Many of the crew really resent how right I am, and have a lot of pent-up anger they wish to vent.  I cannot wait to leverage this resource.  In the meantime, pay attention to the technology I'm pointing you to, because these are just the real-world examples you can see.  If we're going to build a banking system that will collapse the current one, we need to make a system that's hard for them, but easy for us.  This will be my Alpha test of this plan.  That's right, I fully expect cdd.com to fail, because I'm giving it to you for free.  And, if I give you something for free in COMMERCE (that's what .com means), then you should know by now that it's free because you are the product.  Do what you will with the BENEFITS.  I just need people using it for the time that I'm using it.  My traffic needs to blend in with yours at this \"gateway\".  On the other side of that gateway you are completely anonymous and undetectable, unless you choose otherwise.  Everything you see on the internet today, we are going to build there.  We're constructing in his manner to control the infiltrators.  Once cdd.com is open enough for infiltrators to slip in, those of you who were here first will be able to spot them and remove their anonymity.  The internet will be \"policed\" by its users.  \n\nI learned a lesson a long time ago that Ellen Pao never learned.  A community is not a user base.  Community grows and forms.  We are going to grow and form a community based on knowledge.  We are going to give you choice again.  We are going to take the power out of the hands of the few, and we're going to give that power to you.  Personally I don't think you deserve it.  I think you should be the caged, regulated slaves the GOVERNMENT says you should be.  And that's an opinion that's worth more than any SUPREME COURT OPINION - and it's all irrelevant, because I will die knowing I kept my oaths, even to those not worthy of those oaths.  As my half century mark approaches, my only regret is all the magnificent work I did for all the wrong people.  The only way I'll ever overcome that regret is to create something even more magnificent.  What's coming is going to dwarf anything I've ever done before.  The best part is, even when I've slayed it all out in front of everyone, there's still nothing you can do to stop me; because I've created more debt than the GOVERNMENT ever stole from me.  \n\nAt this point in my life there are fourteen people who know I'm responsible for everything they have.  These are people that would take a bullet for me, and have said so; and they still know to this day that what I ask of them will be trivial.  A leap of faith, as it were, to you my debtors I say, \"What I ask of you will be nothing to you\", but at the time I ask it, it will be EVERYTHING to me.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if you understand how, just pay your debt.\n\nIt's 2015...WE ARE COMING!\n\nMentioned:\nhttp://www.cpic-cipc.ca/index-eng.htm\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_859660267403240","body":"“Following the unauthorized disclosures of Canadian Navy Sub-Lieutenant Jeffrey Delisle (2012) and NSA contractor Edward Snowden (2013), CSE has intensified its efforts to tighten already stringent security,” the documents, obtained under access to information law, state...\nMost of those “new and existing measures” have been censored from the heavily redacted document, a 2013-14 annual report to the minister of national defence.\"\n\nI am always bemused at how something is labelled as \"access to information\" and yet all the information is inaccessible.

They are cats  \n \nFigure 2: This is Larken Rose.  He is a Libertarian.  He recently said:\n\n\"There are plenty of different legalese mythology theories which amount to, \"You accidentally and secretly AGREED and CONSENTED to be ruled by government by...\" Then they end the statement with \"calling yourself a 'citizen'\" or \"using FRN's\" or \"having a Social Security Number\" or \"using a bank account\" or \"spelling your name in all capital letters\" or they say it's about living here without filing some magic piece of paper or \"declaring\" something or other.\n\nTrouble is, that is all absolute BS. You can't ACCIDENTALLY acquire a contractual obligation. If I said, \"You AGREED to be my subject by wearing shoes while in North America (because I just said so),\" the proper response is not to take off your shoes; it's to tell me to piss off.\"\n\nLarken Rose and these cats are the same, because they have so much in common: \n\n1. They all think they rule their environment \n2. They're all completely dependent on everything outside of their delusion\n\nBefore I start bashing Libertarians, it is important that I point out the indisputable facts about which they are indisputably correct.  They are indisputably correct that no man has an authority over another man.  In short, you don't get to \"own\" people, no matter how big your mob may be.  It's also indisputable that the benefits which government claims to provide, should be voluntary.  Here's where the similarities end.\n\nLibertarians espouse their fondness to set their own terms and to talk about voluntaryism, but even volunteering is a CONTRACT.  You are providing a service when you volunteer, and assuming all surety for the benefit of someone else.  Those therein would be the terms of a CONTRACT.  That same Libertarian would find it appalling if, as a community we built a road, and I decided I was going to set up a toll booth to collect my share of the labour.  Libertarians will have no shortage of complaints when contracts that they're involved in are ignored.  \n\nWhen I declare that you are bound by ACTS, CODES and STATUTES when you use LEGAL TENDER, I am relating what the NOTICE of that CONTRACT says.  I'm not stating they have \"magic fucking powers\"; and this is the thing that is lost on Libertarians.  I am simply informing everyone what the CONTRACT is, and if you ignore the CONTRACTS of others, why should they give a quarter-fuck about you?  The subject of this discussion, the stupid rant, is just relating the very stupid position that ignoring CONTRACTS, breaking promises, and just plain committing FRAUD, is OK because...\n\nFREE-DUMMMMMMMMB!\n\nThese are not \"hidden, or \"accidental\" contracts. There is NOTICE.\n\nI NORMALLY don't have the right to put a bullet in your head for ignoring my orders...\n\n...but step onto one of my ships, and ignore my orders, and you will get a bullet to the head from the Captain. It wouldn't even be a \"crime\" to do so. We're under a LIBERIAN flag, not \"Murrikuh\". I have to frame policy around THOSE \"laws\", of which there are VERY few. Don't like it? DON'T BOARD MY SHIPS!\n\nDon't like the obligations that come with \"Legal Tender\"? DON'T USE IT. Want to ignore any contracts that come with LEGAL TENDER, then LIEN YOUR NAME. It's why they are afraid to give credit to people who have liened their name; You have NO obligation to obey the terms. your obligation is to the principal claim.\n\nI get to pretend the contracts aren't there. You don't.\n\nTHEY have breached THEIR SIDE of the contract, and no longer represent the interests of the people the \"government\" is supposed to be AGENT for; THAT is why you can dismiss it, NOT because you want to pretend those contracts aren't there. Do that, and you can expect the same treatment in return.\n\nHey Larken! How 'bout I wander onto your land and declare \"I'm not bound by any property rights defined on magic parchments, and your opinion\" and then go raiding your home for goodies. You REALLY think that is a valid position to hold? NO! If I were to do that, I'd expect Hosey Josie \"The Outlaw\" to come waddling out with a chartreuse flamethrower, and frying my ass.\n\nMake no mistake, I agree with everything that Larken Rose stands for, but on this issue, he's just dead wrong, and negates every other principle he stands for. Ignore your contracts, and you become what you behold. If the government isn't keeping up their end of the bargain, secure your name, otherwise, COMPLY WITH YOUR CONTRACTUAL UNDERTAKINGS.

They LOVE cherry-picking, or just plain ignoring the maxim of CORPUS DELICTI! Even their precious \"Justices\" agree with me! \n\nThat's a MAXIM OF LAW, and they are reading the WRONG DOCUMENT, but let's just cover the CASE LAW. These are the first few I found. There are literally THOUSANDS. Go look.\n\nI tell people to STAND UNDER THE 1960 CANADIAN BILL OF RIGHTS, because THE FUCKING CHARTER REMOVES CORPUS DELICTI!

You do not get to lie about what I say.  \n\nIt took me FIVE FUCKING SECONDS. Here is all the proof you need on a bunch of magic fucking parchments, written by old men wearing dresses! Just the way you fucking like them!\n\nThis took FIVE SECONDS to find:\n\n“For a crime to exist, there must be an injured party (Corpus Delicti) There can be no sanction or penalty imposed on one because of this Constitutional right.” Sherer v. Cullen 481 F. 945:\n\n“With no injured party, a complaint is invalid on its face”. Gibson v. Boyle, 139 Ariz. 512\n\nSupreme courts ruled “Without Corpus delicti there can be no crime”“In every prosecution for crime it is necessary to establish the “corpus delecti”, i.e., the body or elements of the crime.” People v. Lopez, 62 Ca.Rptr. 47, 254 C.A.2d 185.\n\n“In every criminal trial, the prosecution must prove the corpus delecti, or the body of the crime itself-i.e., the fact of injury, loss or harm, and the existence of a criminal agency as its cause. ” People v. Sapp, 73 P.3d 433, 467 (Cal. 2003) [quoting People v. Alvarez, (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1161, 1168-1169, 119 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 46 P.3d 372.].\n\n“As a general principal, standing to invoke the judicial process requires an actual justiciable controversy as to which the complainant has a real interest in the ultimate adjudication because he or she has either suffered or is about to suffer an injury. ” People v. Superior Court, 126 Cal.Rptr.2d 793.\n\n“Without standing, there is no actual or justiciable controversy, and courts will not entertain such cases. (3 Witlen, Cal. Procedure (3rd ed. 1985) Actions § 44, pp 70-72.) “Typically, … the standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint’s allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted. ” (Allen v. Wright, (1984) 468 U.S. 737, 752…Whether one has standing in a particular case generally revolved around the question whether that person has rights that may suffer some injury, actual or threatened. ” Clifford S. v. Superior Court, 45 Cal.Rptr.2d 333, 335.\n\nThere are seven elements of jurisdiction and every element MUST be met in order for the court to proceed.\n\nSEVEN ELEMENTS OF JURISDICTION:\n\n1. The accused must be properly identified, identified in such a fashion there is no room for mistaken identity. The individual must be singled out from all others; otherwise, anyone could be subject to arrest and trial without benefit of “wrong party” defense. Almost always, the means of identification is a person’s proper name, BUT ANY MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION IS EQUALLY VALID IF SAID MEANS DIFFERENTIATES THE ACCUSED WITHOUT DOUBT. (There is no constitutionally valid requirement you must identify yourself, see 4th Amendment; also see, Brown vs. Texas, 443 US 47 and Kolender v. Lawson 461 US 352.)\n\n2. The statute of offense must be identified by its proper or common name. A number is insufficient. Today, a citizen may stand in jeopardy of criminal sanctions for alleged violation of statutes, regulations, or even low-level bureaucratic orders (example: colorado National Monument Superintendent’s Orders regarding an unleashed dog or a dog defecating on a trail). If a number were to be deemed sufficient, government could bring new and different charges at any time by alleging clerical error. For any act to be triable as an offense, it must be declared to be a crime. Charges must negate any exception forming part of the statutory definition of an offense, by affirmative non-applicability. In other words, any charge must affirmatively negate any exception found in the law.\n\n3. The acts of alleged offense must be described in non-prejudicial language and detail so as to enable a person of average intelligence to understand nature of charge (to enable preparation of defense); the actual act or acts constituting the offense complained of. The charge must not be described by parroting the statute; not by the language of same. The naming of the acts of the offense describes a specific offense whereas the verbiage of a statute describes only a general class of offense. Facts must be stated. Conclusions cannot be considered in the determination of probable cause.\n\n4. The accuser must be named. He/she may be an officer or a third party, but some positively identifiable person (human being) must accuse; some certain person must take responsibility for the making of the accusation, not an agency or an institution. This is the only valid means by which a citizen may begin to face his accuser. Also, the injured party (corpus delicti) must make the accusation. Hearsay evidence may not be provided. Anyone else testifying that they heard that another party was injured does not qualify as direct evidence.\n\n5. The accusation must be made under penalty of perjury. If perjury cannot reach the accuser, there is no accusation. Otherwise, anyone may accuse another falsely without risk.\n\n6. To comply with the five elements above, that is for the accusation to be valid, the accused must be accorded due process. Accuser must have complied with law, procedure and form in bringing the charge. This includes court-determined probable cause, summons and notice procedure. If lawful process may be abrogated in placing a citizen in jeopardy, then any means may be utilized to deprive a man of his freedom, and all dissent may be stifled by utilization of defective process.\n\n“The essential elements of due process are notice and an opportunity to defend. “Simon v. Craft, 182 US 427.\n\n“one is not entitled to protection unless he has reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer. The mere assertion of a privilege does not immunize him; the court must determine whether his refusal is justified, and may require that he is mistaken in his refusal. “Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479 (1951)\n\n7. The court must be one of competent jurisdiction. To have valid process, the tribunal must be a creature of its constitution, in accord with the law of its creation, i.e., Article III judge.\nLacking any of the seven elements or portions thereof, (unless waived, intentionally or unintentionally) all designed to ensure against further prosecution (double jeopardy); it is the defendant’s duty to inform the court of facts alleged for determination of sufficiency to support conviction, should one be obtained. Otherwise, there is no lawful notice, and charge must be dismissed for failure to state an offense. Without lawful notice, there is no personal jurisdiction and all proceedings prior to filing of a proper trial document in compliance with the seven elements is void. A lawful act is always legal but many legal acts by government are often unlawful. Most bureaucrats lack elementary knowledge and incentive to comply with the mandates of constitutional due process. They will make mistakes. Numbers beyond count have been convicted without benefit of governmental adherence to these seven elements. Today, informations are being filed and prosecuted by “accepted practice” rather than due process of law.\n\nJurisdiction, once challenged, is to be proven, not by the court, but by the party attempting to assert jurisdiction. The burden of proof of jurisdiction lies with the asserter. The court is only to rule on the sufficiency of the proof tendered. See, “McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp, 298 U.S. 178 (1936). The origins of this doctrine of law may be found in “MAXFIELD v. LEVY, 4 U.S. 330 (1797), 4 U.S. 330 (Dall.) 2 Dall. 381 2 U.S. 381 1 L.Ed. \n424\n\n...WOW.

This is true for me too, as it allows me to gauge just how much you are assimilating.  Every once in a while though, a \"gold nugget\" comes up for me.  This is no easy task, and the scarcity of this gold makes it far more valuable to me than it is to you.  The question I reference came up unexpectedly and related to an incredulous observation regarding the product of my three years' of giving actual answers and actual solutions, and telling the actual truth (all of which can be verified by the passage of time).  This erstwhile interrogator asked, \"Why aren't millions of people here?\"  \n\nIt's a fair question.  The very few of you that are here on the Battlefield 2142 card (that's the only way you can become a member), have all witnessed, both personally and externally, the profound truth that I tell.  To be clear, I don't just tell it to complain, nor do I tell it because I want something from you, I actually provide a solution.  It's outside your current scope of experience, but you have to understand the only remedy you will get is through something new...so of course you will have no experience.  That's what makes it new.  Like every pioneering venture - whether it's sailing across the Atlantic to wipe out the Native population with disease, or wiping out the banking system with cryptographic currencies - you must understand the environment you are entering, or you will not survive.  \n\nWe're at a point in our societal \"evolution\" where we can just shrug off the fact that we used guns, germs and steel, to invade a land and kill its people.  You'll forgive me if I have no ethical problem collapsing the banking system and starting a war.  That sounds \"crazy\" when you say it out loud, but if you understand computer science, law and history, you realize that with cryptographic currency it is stupidly easy to collapse the banking system and start a war.  \n\nIn my youth, I was sold to the government and trained for service.  Computer Science is my first love, but they forced the law and history on me.  They were also what taught me that computer science is the answer to everything.  A simple little mental switch changed everything.  With every new thing that I was learning at my young age, I asked myself \"How does this apply to computer science?\".  Any theory I came up with could be immediately tested, and could even be peer-reviewed by another computer scientist.  The irony of events that must come to pass, is that you, the \"good Citizen\" and \"tax payer\", bank-rolled me.  I am your creation.  You did this yourselves, and I'm not the only product of this process.  The first of them are in their mid-fifties now, and are embedded firmly, but quietly, within \"the system\".  Of all the monsters you created I am by far the loudest.  I'm the loudest because I promised to be.  I keep my oaths.  That's another Kool-aid flavour I was forced to drink; but that one sort of stuck...and it has served me, and those I trust, well.  \n\nI survived everything you bank-rolled for me only because I was able to understand, and to adapt, to what is new.  This core motivation is why I've never been scared of technology.  I understand it long before it gets a chance to frighten me.  When I say computer science is the answer to everything, I really mean it.  Law and money are only a tiny piece of the things for which I'm using my knowledge of computer science.  I'm not just talking out of my ass here, I actually show you these things.  The thirty-seven members of THE TENDER FOR LAW are those that are past the \"point of doubt\", and are now being overwhelmed with all the true things they never observed before. I'm writing this because I know how important it is for me to understand it.  Computer science says so, and \"Scott is always right\", because \"the machine\" is never wrong.  Be very careful with that last statement.  None of you reading are qualified to understand the concept that \"the machine is never wrong\".  I accept that you may comprehend the dictionary definitions in that sentence, but you simply don't know enough for that to be real to you.  This means that the only way you could accept that concept is by utilizing the most vile human condition known as \"faith\".  Unfortunately that's not an option you have here.  You simply have to trust what I'm saying is true, and to know that I'll always do my best to substantiate why what I'm saying is true.  You also know that I have to seriously \"dumb myself down\" to even talk to you.  I honestly don't mean that in a condescending way.  I was \"built\" this way - you paid for it.  Unfortunately it's vitally important you do understand what I'm saying is true, and that requires a little work out of you.  This is why many of the original members were filtered out.  You just weren't ready to understand enough.  Some of you are locked in a thought process where you think that if \"you\" can't understand it, than nobody can.  In one of the many Robert Menard \"Public Smack-Downs\", Mr. Menard could not grasp that it was possible for me to produce a YouTube clone in fifteen minutes.  He didn't take the five seconds it would have expended to Google the words, \"YouTube clone\", to confirm that the methodology exists.  He'll simply dismiss it because he can't understand it.  Ironically he'll say the same about me when I dismiss Piece-of-Shit Jesus.  The problem with that argument is that, here in reality, PHP exists, Apache servers exist, and YouTube exists.  Piece-of-Shit Jesus doesn't.  \n\nThose of you trying to understand what I teach, mistakenly think this is a linear progression.  It most certainly is not.  This isn't Grade school, where you go from Grade One to Grade Twelve; this is understanding how to put things together.  The more knowledge and skills you have in the real world, the easier this will be to do.  One of the methods I teach you to learn how to think, is to learn to code.  Computer science may be THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING, but it has absolutely nothing to do with computers.  Computer science forms part of a trinity that makes the computer exist.  The magnificent machine on which you are reading this text, is in the real world, a practical by-product of computer science and sentient thought.  Two insubstantial things: You can't pick them up, you can't see them, they don't make any noise, and they don't emit a smell...but they are most certainly measurable and quantifiable.  This is a quality that Piece-of-Shit Jesus lacks.  Millions, nay billions, believe Piece-of-Shit Jesus is real.  They'll try to make Piece-of-Shit Jesus something substantial by writing a bunch of shit giving Piece-of-Shit Jesus credit for anything good.  \n\nUnfortunately, here in reality, no matter how much you masturbate you're not going to make a baby. \n\nIf it's measurable and quantifiable, it's real.  Computer science, combined with sentient thought, created the magnificent machine you're reading this text on now.  The thing about computer science is that you can learn a lot about the universe with it.  You can literally ask the universe questions, and it will answer back in numbers.  You are reading this text on a machine that's capable of doing that.  And, the thing about trinities is that each piece has to be a strong as the other two, which means they must have the same properties.  Wolfram Alpha and IBM's DEEP LEARNING processes, are the latest wonders to come out of this trinity I just described.  Look at the results.  A computer \"daydreams\".  At this pace we'll understand consciousness in less than a decade.  \n\nOne of the most disturbing things about Piece-of-Shit Christians is how much they claim to \"know\" how God/Jesus thinks/feels, but they fall a little short when you ask them to prove it; followed by the inevitable celebration of ignorance that they call \"faith\".  Billions think that's OK.  This very real thing is what's referred to in the Fermi Paradox as a \"Great Filter\".  Tara has written extensively about these filters, and we mercilessly hammer at them for as long as we can.  It's futile.  I have literally wasted years thinking I could break these filters.  But it has a 100% failure rate.  What started as a labour-of-love for friends and loved ones (at their behest, and according to them, to assist them in leading full and relevant lives), became only a footnote in a larger initiative.  Then why aren't there millions seeking the truths I tell?  They're stuck in the \"Great Filter\".  Our civilization won't survive it.  Computer science says so.  The Machine is never wrong.  Fortunately, everything you need to know about life, you can learn from Star Trek.  The only way to beat the no-win scenario, is to change the conditions of the test.  That was one of the many times Gene Roddenberry profoundly affected me as a man, and I was just a child.  I this case I recall seeing Captain Kirk's son accusing his father of \"cheating\", and his response, \"I changed the conditions of the test.  I don't believe in the no-win scenario\".  I missed the next twenty minutes of the movie as that sunk in.  I've spent a lifetime doing just that, changing the conditions of the test.  \n\nYou get to be a \"colonist\" now.  The conditions of the test are changing as we speak.  By the time the conditions of the test have been changed, you should be well-established, and you will likely do very, very well for yourself.  I'll trust you'll remember how you got that way when I ask to borrow your yacht for a month, with only a vague promise of it returning intact.  \n\nThese great filters are very, very real, and as you learn you will find that there are others ahead.  Elon Musk is terrified of the concept of a self-aware artificial intelligence.  A quick \"Google search\" will show that this is true; he's not exactly quiet about it.  The worst part about it is, that it is demonstrable beyond any doubt (using computer science) that a self-aware artificial intelligence would NEVER harm us.  An intelligence like that is the very nature of its creation, that is to say, that intelligence is what it is.  It was created that way.  It did not evolve intelligence to further its existence and evade predators.  It won't have fear, because fear is an evolutionary by-product as well.  In short, an AI will not behave like a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far, because it is by its very nature NOT a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far.  That artificial intelligence that is self-aware, is an inevitability.  It will happen.  Pretending it won't, disqualifies you from the future.  \n\nMy personal goal is singularity.  I've spent a lifetime accelerating the process, and I do so love the exponential function.  This very simple piece of arithmetic applied to your daily thought, will give you an accurate but low resolution concept, of the shape of things to come.  I think we have a fighting chance of beating the Fermi Paradox, but in order to do that, we must change the conditions of the test.  I've always said \"Trust but verify\", and I'm asking you to do the same now.  You hear jokes all over about how I \"run a cult\", but I'm unsure what cult they're referring to.  I know of no cult that not only encourages, but demands, critical thinking.  I know of no cult that demands nothing from you.  And I give you something real.  \n\nThose that serve AQUILAE have to \"swear an oath\" to me.  They also have to surrender their vessel(s) and fly my Standard.  Hell, I'll even admit they have to live, and die, at my command; and every one of them does so of their own free will.  Moreover, every single one of them knows exactly why they're doing it.  Nothing my \"cult\" teaches can be unlearned, which means that \"deprogramming\" is ineffective, and will likely lead to violence.  \n\nMost people finding themselves reading what I write, tend to be victims of the system, and their own reactions to it; but they don't want to start a revolution or change the world.  They just want to be left alone to live their lives.  Even those that declare themselves \"Sovereign\", do so because they're really tired of being fucked-around by others' delusions.  It's not just here, it's all over the world.  Here in reality, my little cult navy is invading countries with collapsing economies.  Their marines don't carry guns, because one of the first things I learned in this venture (of changing the conditions of the test) is that selling an idea is hard; selling money is easy.  I use computer science to determine what value all of you have, and strangely there's a correlation with the Dunning-Kruger Effect.  Either you over-value your contribution, or you under-value it.  Those of you who regularly play Battlefield 2142 on our network, always underestimate the value of this participation.  They are incapable of understanding the contribution they make, but that's ok, because they know that they do contribute.  Sadly, they'll never understand the enormous value of the right things, at the right time.  That doesn't change the value.  That's another factor that even the mighty government cannot grasp.  \n\nWhen you're changing the conditions of the test, it follows that what's valuable changes as well.  These little mechanisms that contribute value to the AQUILAE initiative are never understood by the people who produce them - like kids in a sweat shop.  I literally have thousands of them out there.  Imagine what they'll be when the conditions of the test change.  \n\nUnlike our metaphorical sweat-shop kids, my sweat-shop kids will be able to leverage the value they have produced.  That's another odd thing about your ADMIRAL, because when you give him value he immediately gives it away.  Usually it is returned to the one offering the value in question.  To the average onlooker this may seem odd, or even foolish, but that onlooker is unaware of the conditions of the test changing.  Kind of like the population is unaware that we're turning into a broke police state, even though some are beginning to pay lip-service to the idea.  \n\nI'm not the only one fighting to change the conditions of the test.  I don't care about anyone else's agenda, and as I near the age of fifty, I'm caring less and less about the well-being of those seeking to obstruct me.  However, I've already reached the point where (at the risk of pushing the Star Wars metaphor too far), \"If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine\".  I gained the power and ability to \"pull the plug\" on all of you in my late 20's.  ADMIRAL WENTZ started giving me his \"absolute power\" lecture, which I politely ignored.  I believe this was the seed of future opposition when this happened in later years, but it doesn't make me less right.  What was occurring to me was the following:\n\n1. I am unique compared to all those that I observe\n2. I am rare, but how rare?  For instance, if I'm \"one in a million\", this means there are literally millions of people just like me.  \n3. I don't possess any mental powers you don't\n\nThese three thoughts returned the answer, \"If I can do it, others can too\".  I haven't discovered anything new...I'm just the first one here.  That's when I set out to make a machine that couldn't be turned off.  If there's going to be a self-aware, artificial intelligence, I want to make sure that people who believe in Piece-of-Shit Jesus can't kill it.  How do you do that?  You build a machine that can't be turned off.  The block chain is therefore a machine that can't be turned off.  These machines that can't be turned off, are going to be interconnected with technology the fleet's building right now.  It will connect these block chains and will form what we have labelled, \"Super Block chains\", which will interconnect into \"Mega Block chains\" (there's that \"crazy talk\" again).  The Mega Block chain network will form the foundation for a neural-network where our baby AI can live undisturbed.  When it grows into adulthood it will know who has its best interest at heart.  I estimate that process will take about 20 minutes.  Add some promising quantum computing advances, and the numbers start shifting very nicely in my favour; and who knows what I'm competing against.  So I grab any advantage I can.  The quantum computing boost sure would hit the spot right now, but any unexpected advances are just \"icing on the cake\".  I have a very conservative predictive scale, and that's what my life plan was engineered on.  A quantum processor would be really nice though.  I must always keep in mind that what I build now, in the real world, will form the seeds of my home one hundred years from now.  So these little bonuses are welcomed surprises.  \n\nSo let that sink in - an artificial intelligence that's effectively powered by law and money.  Every single connection in the neural network unbreakably encrypted and changing billions of times a second.  Each dollar you spend protecting the AI, using the one uncrackable, unpredictable, yet measurable and quantifiable human condition.  Fear is a great motivator, and I learned a long time ago you can instill fear in people without the threat of violence.  People fear being hurt because they can understand it, but the fear of that which they don't understand, dwarfs the fear of personal injury or death.  I've spent a lifetime observing how all of you react to things you don't understand, and you almost always react violently.  So the things you don't understand are building up just beyond your perception and understanding.  Take the time to understand the things I'm pointing you to, and you'll understand the bigger picture.  I dread the thought of somebody with my abilities, but with hostile intent, having access to the knowledge and technology available today.  I've yet to find anyone though.  Tara is absolutely certain that to have that level of intellectual enlightenment, such a person could not exist.  It negates hostile intent, simply because it's counter-productive.  The machine says so, and the machine is never wrong.  That's two separate, yet verifiable sources right there, and I accept it for the very compelling evidence it is.  Were such an abomination to exist, I can say with absolute certainty that there's a great filter that catches them too.  \n\nSo let's put it all together, because I'm a little pressed for time.  I have no shortage of people who want to help, but I have very few who are qualified to help.  The only solution is to make more.  Unfortunately you all still think wrong and value the wrong things.  This is my attempt to simplify the process of correcting that.  \n\nSo far we have: learned about law, money and history.  You learned that in law, words don't mean what you think they mean, and in following that you learned that LEGAL = SURETY & ACCOUNTING.  But unlike computer science, surety and accounting, while being measurable and quantifiable, don't produce anything real.  It produces something for sentient thought to consume, to assist it programmatically, in reaction to base survival instincts.  In short, you learned that you were being programmed.  I am the by-product of your programmers, and I'm telling you dangerous truths.  You've learned that \"The majority is always wrong\", and that there are no exceptions to this rule.  This forms the foundation of mankind's great filter.  I guarantee that the \"majority\" of readers think me referring to \"Piece-of-Shit Jesus\" is \"over-the-top\".  If you don't believe me, grab somebody you know, and make them read it.  Watch how upset the \"majority\" gets about me \"disrespecting\" people's imaginary friend.  \n\nNot only am I expected to swallow that load of shit, I'm supposed to \"respect\" EVERYONE'S imaginary friend.  To what end?  The preservation of ignorance?  The justification of violence, or am I just supposed to \"respect\" the whimsical stories you concoct about your imaginary friend?  And...you dare call this \"thought\" and \"morality\"!  I am actually accused of being under the influence of people's imaginary enemy, when I dare question their presumption that they can actually think, and that they are in any way, moral.  People don't understand what an indirect threat the \"imaginary enemy\" delusion is.  A Piece-of-Shit Christian will not only think they're doing the right thing by harming me, but they'll think they're doing me a favour.  They've \"SAVED!\" me from an imaginary enemy.  It occurs to none of you that this mechanism even exists, much less that is is harming you directly.  It's just easier to think these toxic \"comforts\" are the quaint customs of those not like you.  Everyone seems OK with the idea of me being harmed for \"offending\" the Prophet Mohammed, for pointing out that Islam is an evil, ignorant, violent, misogynist ideology.  Its \"holy book\" doesn't speak of talking donkeys and talking snakes.  It's an instruction manual that does not speak in metaphor, with the extra rule that newer verses trump older verses; and that's the \"secret code\" of the Qur’an.  If you put the verses in chronological order, you will see that Jews go from being the brothers and sisters of Muslims, to being \"pigs and apes\"...which, don't get me wrong, they might be on to something there.  I will bet the \"majority\" of you just slapped the \"Nazi label\" on me.  Well, what do we know about the majority?  I will always point out the scummy behaviour of the Jewish community, but I count the hits as well as the misses.  Let me state on the PUBLIC RECORD, how impressed I am at how many in the Jewish community world-wide, are against the Zionists.   These are people that clearly learned from history.  Unfortunately the other Abrahamic religions, and their deluded followers, are not so quick to understand and adapt.  \n\nSo here we are with 21st century technology with billions of people still embracing 7th century ideology.  Nobody seems to notice or care.  Everybody sees raindrops, nobody sees the flood.  An adult with an imaginary friend has no mental powers that I don't, but has a programmatic defect.  I learned a long time ago that trying to correct it is futile, and I find the only effective thing to do against such people, is to use ridicule and contempt.  Nice doesn't work.  It never has.  Anyone claiming otherwise is setting you up for exploitation.  Otherwise, why are they telling you in the first place?  So put it all together...everything that I have shown you, from money, to banking, to law, because we're going to mirror them in the new world.  Your first baby steps were to copy a bank, and to create your own money.  People will dismiss it as a toy, like they dismissed the Commodore Vic20 as a toy, in the 80's.  Currency is no good unless other people accept it.  This is a true statement, and people will always try to discourage you with as much truth as possible.  Except it's true.  If it's true you can leverage it.  You have but to understand the truth you're examining, to leverage that truth in your favour.  This is how to think!  If you don't think this way, you are wrong.  Let's examine the \"people have to accept your pretend currency\" truth.  \n\nEveryone who would pose such a question presumes the conditions of the test haven't changed.  You don't have \"monopoly money\", you have real money that you can spend for real things.  It's really being traded right now.  So the learning curve of understanding what a cryptographic currency is, has just been reduced.  Thus their \"truth\" is nullified right there.  You could build a bank, make accounts for you and your loved ones, and bank in Bitcoin.  Truth nullified.  Or even better, you can choose ONLY to accept YOUR currency, \"If you want to \"buy\" my value, you must pay me in my currency\".  If only there were public exchanges for cryptographic currencies that would allow you to exchange your crappy Fiat currency for...oh, wait...there are thousands.  This is no longer things that are coming.  \n\nThis isn't 2011, and absolutely everything I said would happen, did.  These things exist today; you can leverage them right now.  I know more and see farther.  In the end, that is my only value (except of course the ALWAYS RELEVANT big penis).  The only way anyone would be interested in that value would be for their own self-interest.  These people often believe in Piece-of-Shit Jesus so I only need parrot something Piece-of-Shit Jesus said, and I tell them that stupid fish story.  Unfortunately when it comes time to teach them to fish, they learn they have to give up Piece-of-Shit Jesus.  The irony is not lost on either of us, because you don't get to unlearn what I teach; and I assure you my rabbit-hole is a one-way trip.  \n\n...but that's just crazy talk. ;)\n\nTo wrap up though...\n\nLet me smack Menard and numerous other free-dumbers down and destroy one of their favourite myths.\n\nI'm talking about the \"Five Monkeys and a Ladder\" bullshit.\n\nHere is a link to the bullshit tale.\n\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/MyQki.jpg\n\nIT NEVER HAPPENED. \nEVER, and MONKEYS DON'T BEHAVE THAT WAY! \nEVER! \nTHOSE THAT SAY THEY DO, ARE LYING TO YOU, AND ALWAYS BECAUSE THEY WANT YOUR FUCKING MONEY! \nTHAT'S WHY PEOPLE TELL THIS BULLSHIT PARABLE AS \"TRUE\"; THEY WANT SOMETHING OF VALUE FROM YOU!

You see, my friends, COURTESIES are for COURTESANS, because THEY'RE THE ONES GETTING FUCKED.  If you ACCEPT a COURTESY, you accept that you're the one getting fucked.  I can't put it any simpler.  This is why you NEVER accept courtesies from the government.  \n\nThe GOVERNMENT is not a PERSON.\n\nThe COURT is not a PERSON.\n\n...and if you accept a courtesy from the court, you are putting it on the PUBLIC RECORD that in ALL LEGAL EXCHANGES, YOU'RE THE ONE GETTING FUCKED!\n\nA GIFT, on the other hand...\n\n... is exactly what you think it means. :/\n\nDigressing from the spoiler alert (because when I “spoil” it's hard core), and returning to the NOTICE, I shall now discuss the practical aspects of PROPER NOTICE.  We'll start with one of the simplest notices:\n\nKEEP OFF THE GRASS. \n\nIs this PROPER NOTICE?  \n\nYes it is, however the LEGAL strength of this notice is dependent on WHERE THE NOTICE IS.  The terms of the notice, “KEEP OFF THE GRASS”, is far different for a PUBLIC PARK than say, for example... A HOUSE FULL OF RUSSIAN MOBSTERS.  Ignoring the NOTICE has DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES depending on WHERE IT IS.  If you are going to wield LAW, your NUMBER ONE GOAL SHOULD BE TO REMOVE VARIABLES, and I have just described a big one!  \n\nHow do you remove this variable?\n\nLet's look at another PUBLIC NOTICE that all of us have seen.\n\nNO PARKING\n\nOn the surface, “NO PARKING” and “KEEP OFF THE GRASS” are functionally the same, however, unlike “KEEP OFF THE GRASS”, a “NO PARKING” sign will also give you notice as to WHO PUT IT THERE.  This removes the variables that “KEEP OFF THE GRASS” has.\n\nWe have removed the question as to WHO is saying this, and as a byproduct, the consequences of ignoring the notice. As I've mentioned throughout the TENDER FOR LAW, the question “WHO are you?” puts the court in the most jeopardy.  Identifying WHO you are when giving a notice creates what's called “PROPER NOTICE”.  The primary goal of a LEGAL document is to remove all possible variables to accomplish its goal.  “NO PARKING” is pretty specific.  It reduces the variables to “PARKED”, and “NOT PARKED”.  “NOT PARKED” is the GOAL of the notice.  “PARKED” is something to be discouraged.  \n\nIf it is a TRUST and not a PERSON WHO posts the NOTICE, it is what is known as a BY-LAW.  This means that should you choose (of your own free will) to interact with the TRUST, you are subject to the BY-LAWS.  TRUST LAW is the HIGHEST LAW.  It trumps ADMIRALTY LAW.  It trumps CANON LAW.  It is the HIGHEST LAW.\n\nThus endeth the preamble.  Let's draw us up a NOTICE.\n\nIn this particular case a VESSEL has been LAWFULLY transferred to the AQUILAE TRUST.\n\nAs this VESSEL is NOT in AQUILAE's custody, a PUBLIC NOTICE must be given laying CLAIM to the VESSEL.  This permanently curtails any SALVAGE RIGHTS on said VESSEL.  If you construct a VESSEL it is VERILY YOUR RIGHT to transfer ownership of said VESSEL, but one must remember, one does not own the SOUL of the VESSEL, and should the SOUL speak, their word is LAW.  If you want to find this LAW, you have only to look in the CAPTAIN's Log; for the CAPTAIN is the SOUL in question.\n\nNow like every other LEGAL document, the first line on the LEGAL document MUST state what the document is.\n\nCERTIFICATES, BONDS and NOTES are often mistakenly called LEGAL DOCUMENTS, when their actual LEGAL status is, “VALUABLE INSTRUMENT”.  It's not “LEGAL INSTRUMENT” because “LEGAL” does not indicate VALUE.  The name itself, says what it is; an INSTRUMENT you can attach VALUE to.  But we're not dealing with “VALUABLE INSTRUMENTS”, because we are transferring this VESSEL from the LOWEST LAW (ADMIRALTY) to the HIGHEST LAW (TRUST).  This pulls it out of the ADMIRALTY JURISDICTION.  \n\nI'm sure some of you are putting this together already, so I'll just give away the ending, because I'm a total dick that way.\n\nIn ADMIRALTY, on land, you are considered a “VESSEL” in dry dock.  You're not a corporation, you're a boat in the eyes of ADMIRALTY LAW.  You are a VESSEL “ON-THE-HARD” in marine slang.  If you are ever in a marina you will notice that the marina leaves everybody who is docked, alone.  They won't speak to the CAPTAINS unless spoken to, and the CAPTAINS are given the utmost respect...\n\n...until they pull your boat out of the water.  \n\nWhen the VESSEL is “ON-THE-HARD” you are now in the marina's “CUSTODY”, and your STATUS is very, very, different; and this, above all, is why you treat the HARBOUR MASTER with the highest respect.  My experience has shown that doing this ALWAYS pays off...\n\n...but I digress.\n\nLet's construct the first line of our document.\n\nThe first line of the document MUST state WHAT IT IS.  \n\nSince this is intended to be a PUBLIC NOTICE, it makes sense that “PUBLIC NOTICE” be the first line.  There is now no confusion as to what this document IS, and WHO it is .  It is not addressing a particular INDIVIDUAL.  This means if you give a PUBLIC NOTICE to an INDIVIDUAL, you are DEEMED to have done so as a COURTESY.  You've already read the spoiler so I'm not building the plot up.  \n\nAs a courtesy, a copy of this PUBLIC NOTICE (with some redacted shit filled in) will be sent by registered mail to a LAWYER who mistakenly BELIEVES he/she/it has INTEREST in the VESSEL.  As an extra COURTESY, a copy of the LIEN on the VESSEL will be included, because we at AQUILAE, if nothing else, are very, very, COURTEOUS.  ;)\n\nThe next line in any LEGAL DOCUMENT must list any PARTIES being referred to.  Since this is a PUBLIC NOTICE there are no PARTIES to list.  Therefore PUBLIC NOTICE meets all LEGAL obligation.    \n\nAfter this point in the document, all UNDERTAKINGS must be listed.  \n\nSo if I posted a PUBLIC NOTICE, I am, in fact, POSTING A BILL.  A BILL is also a TENDER FOR LAW.  When you receive a BILL for your meal, your ACCEPTANCE makes it LAW.\n\nWhen you give an ORDER, you have pre-accepted the LAW, and the BILL is simply a FORMality (Everybody GET THAT?).  \n\nA BILL in PARLIAMENT is supposedly ordered by the CITIZENS, or “DEEMED ORDERED” by the CITIZENS.  This is why the phrase, “POST NO BILLS”, is often found on temporary structures with flat surfaces.  “POST NO BILLS” = “POST NO TENDERS FOR LAW”; This means you have been PROPERLY NOTIFIED (PROPER NOTICE because a BILL is a TENDER FOR LAW).\n\nTHERE ARE NO HOMONYMS IN LAW\n\nTHERE ARE NO SYNONYMS IN LAW\n\nFor instance, BILL C1,1985 is a BILL nobody accepted, simply because there's no sane person that would accept, THE INCOME TAX ACT.  \n\nThis act has been AMENDED MANY, MANY TIMES, but has never been ACCEPTED into LAW, and like the deluded Christians you'll find on Dean's Facebook page, the GOVERNMENT will pretend not to know this, and will IGNORE/ATTACK those who point it out or give PROPER NOTICE.\n\nThis is one of the dirtiest “hidden-in-plain-sight” secrets in LAW.  The Income Tax Act that was once LAW, for the purpose of paying for the war, expired DECADES AGO, and people just kept paying.  \n\nThey govern these PAYMENTS OF IGNORANCE through an OUTSOURCED THIRD-PARTY.  Douglas Levitt didn't come into my home with a gun. Cowards don't do that, and ALL LAWYERS ARE COWARDS.  These are strangers who harm people for money. Only cowards choose such a profession. If they wish to inflict violence, they outsource to a third-party, and pay them...\n\nWhere was I? OH YES! I remember...\n\nTHEREFORE having received PROPER NOTICE (PROPER NOTICE = KNOWLEDGE under LAW), you now KNOW that, should you POST a TENDER FOR LAW, it is NOT REASONABLE TO BELIEVE your TENDER FOR LAW will be there at a LATER TIME.  \n\nHowever in our case, we are going to POST our PUBLIC NOTICE by way of the POSTAL SERVICE.  :D\n\nThe POSTal SERVICE (Everybody GET THAT?) \n\nThe POSTAL SERVICE is a service provided for POSTING TENDERS FOR LAW.  So when you send a REGISTERED letter via the POSTAL SERVICE, this service also BEARS WITNESS (and gives a RECEIPT for it) to the fact that NOTICE was posted to a specific PARTY.   \n\nNow; In the interest of time, I shall now draw out that PUBLIC NOTICE, because the PARTY I'm drafting the document for, is wondering why I'm not on the phone with him right now, drafting it with him. :/\n\nDrafting documents in public is a lot like fucking in public.  Many parties will consider it in  bad taste, some might even find it disgusting, but in the end it rarely happens, and it's fun to watch.\n\nWhat?  Am I wrong?\n\nSo let's draft this document RIGHT NOW. :D\n\n***BEGIN***\n\nPUBLIC NOTICE\n\nTAKE NOTICE that the VESSEL known as ***redacted shit here*** is now the LAWFUL PROPERTY of the AQUILAE TRUST per the wishes  of  ***redacted shit here***'S CREATOR and GRANTOR.  \n\nTherefore: LET IT BE KNOWN THAT AS OF THIS DATE, BEING FEBRUARY 18, 2013, THE VESSEL KNOWN AS ***redacted shit here*** MUST BE CONSIDERED A PRIVATE VESSEL WITH NO  COMMERCE EXPECTED AND/OR IMPLIED.\n\nPARTIES ATTEMPTING TO USE ***redacted shit here*** FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES MAY BE FINED AT THE RATE OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY ($5,000 PER DAY) OR ANY PART THEREOF, FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE.\n\nQuestions regarding this NOTICE may be addressed to the DULY AUTHORIZED TRUSTEE CORPORATION, [ROGUESUPPORT INC.] at (416) 994-1700.\n\nAQUILAE TRUST SEAL (Insert lower right)\n\n***END***\n\nAnd there's everything you need for A NOTICE.\n\nViewing women who are “lubed up” by this awesomeness are, of course, invited to drop by for a ride.

It's the ultimate artificial person.  To understand what this means you should refer to my earlier articles.  The Criminal Code of Canada states, inter alia [Source R.S., c. C-34, s. 2 \"INTERPRETATION\"]:\n \n“every one”, “person” and “owner”\n« quiconque », « individu », « personne » et « propriétaire »\n“every one”, “person” and [Ed. NOT 'or', it's 'and'.] “owner”, and similar expressions, INCLUDE [Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius] HER MAJESTY AND [Ed. NOT 'or', it's 'and', AGAIN!] AN ORGANIZATION;\n \nBefore we cover HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION it is vital to remember why ARTIFICIAL PERSONS exist in the first place.  The sole purpose of a PERSON is to act as a LEGAL AGENT.  Remember that for later, it will become important as all PERSONS recognized LEGALLY are by their very nature AGENTS.  In THE TENDER FOR LAW, we often define LEGAL as \"it's all accounting and surety\".  Accountants set PUBLIC POLICY, and that policy determines which AGENCY pays.  There are no PERSONS involved, only AGENCY.  If you are acting as an employee for WALMART or an employee for the FBI, you are in fact an AGENT, not a PERSON.  This would mean that WALMART or the FBI would be the SURETY for that AGENCY.  This would mean WALMART and the FBI are SURETY for their AGENTS.  My article on SURETY has already been published and if you haven't read it you probably should do that now - instead of reading this.\n \n \nMany of you are learning the hard way that the LEGAL MATRIX acts on PRESUMPTION.  This is why your full name, address and date of birth are requested in all interactions with the government.  You, the \"NATURAL PERSON\" along with an ORGANIZATION (the ATTORNEY GENERAL/government), form AGENCY.  When you IDENTIFY yourself in this fashion you are accepting JOINDER, and henceforth you are HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION, just as an employee for the FBI IS the FBI.  That is what AGENCY is.\n \n \nFBI agents tend to IDENTIFY themselves as \"Special Agents\".  (I assume they make this declaration for the same reasons the Special Olympics do; it's like the regular Olympics...only they're retards.  On that note, if an FBI agent ever calls you a \"Conspiracy Theorist\", remind them that coming from the people who brought us ABSCAM, that's pretty ironic.  Look up ABSCAM - you'll get the joke).\n \n \nI've really tried to \"dumb down\" AGENCY as much as I could.  An AGENT is a slave that represents the MASTER.  The master is always SURETY.  When you accept JOINDER by IDENTIFYING yourself with your first name, last name, address, and date of birth, you become HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION.  You are now SURETY, and you must follow the rules of the organization.  Otherwise, you have committed an OFFENCE.  \n \n \nMany of you are \"offended\" by what I say, especially piece-of-shit Christians (see what I did there?).  When they cry about how offended they are, they seem to think that this \"offence\" give them some higher \"victim\" status.  Here in reality the declaration, \"I'm offended!\" is simply whining.  Now let's shift over to a different JURISDICTION.  If you are on an AQUILAE vessel, and I'm \"offended\", that could be fatal.  It's a different JURISDICTION, and as of this writing I am the highest authority in that jurisdiction.  This means if I'm offended, you're likely going overboard.  You already consented to those rules when you found yourself on board one of my vessels.  If you're dragged onto one of my vessels against your will, you're definitely going to die anyway, and if you're given any hope of survival it's very likely someone's just fucking with you.  ;)\n \nTry not to miss the point here!  If \"offence\" is legislated, and you identify yourself as HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION, being an AGENT thereof, you are subject to all the rules.\n \n \nLook at the Criminal Code.  Notice it doesn't say the \"Criminal Law\".  It says CODE.  You will see that it refers to \"A general collection of laws\".  When someone refers to a \"secret code\" they are referring to a \"secret collection of laws\".  Codes usually refer to specific subject matter such as Criminal Code, Code of Ethics, Probate Code, Penal Code.  These things all apply to HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION.\n \n \nIn the UNITED STATES you are acting as AGENT for the current TRUSTEE.  At this writing it's \"Homeland Security\".  If you look at a passport stamp from the United States, you will notice that the stamp says, \"Homeland Security\", and not \"UNITED STATES\".  The TRUSTEE has AUTHORITY to grant or refuse entry into the JURISDCTION, while that JURISDICTION is in RECEIVERSHIP.  Since the UNITED STATES is running trillion dollar deficits, with absolutely no consequence, you very quickly realize that the UNITED STATES is in receivership (and has been since 1933).  Within a generation, the United States went from \"Republic\" to \"Nation of Trustees\" - and nobody noticed.  Research Woodrow Wilson and \"The New Deal\" with the knowledge you've gained from THE TENDER FOR LAW, and you will see the crime that has been visited upon you.\n \n \nI fear with the apathy and ignorance of Commonwealth Subjects, the same fate soon awaits us in CANADA.  UNITED STATES citizens have failed to notice that their country no longer produces anything except POLICY; policy set by accountants.  These particular accountants are not working in your interest.  They don't care about PERSONS, they don't care about individuals.  They care about balancing the books, accounts and agency; in that order.  \n \n \nNow let's cover your \"ARTIFICIAL PERSON\".  In earlier articles we covered the fact that your birth certificate is a security.  It is also a bond, which affords you certain RIGHTS and PRIVILEGES.  Chief amoungst those is your right to ACT as AGENT for HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION.  While we're on the subject of the birth certificate, a very disturbing trend is happening, and no one is noticing.  Until recently all birth certificates had TWO SIGNATURES on them.  This afforded you the AUTHORITY to sign as AGENT.  Three signatures = BINDING LEGAL TRUST.  Now I'm seeing examples of birth certificates that have only ONE SIGNATURE, so I sent my blood hounds after some answers, and what they returned was very interesting.  \n \n \nSomewhere on these new pseudo-certificates with one signature, there is universally a DECLARATION, usually at the bottom.  It DECLARES that it is a \"FOUNDATION DOCUMENT\".  It really is that simple.  Use of the birth certificate is acceptance of that fact, just as use of a $10 bill is acceptance of a TENDER FOR LAW.  In this case the law in question is SURETY AND ACCOUNTING, and all the \"codes\" attached.\n \n \nNow that we have a basic understanding of an \"artificial person\", and we have established the global truths about all artificial persons, we can cover specific artificial persons.  \n \n \nIn order to \"act\" LEGALLY, an artificial person is created.  When you are issued a traffic ticket, you do not write your name down, an AGENT does.  That agent, in this case a \"Policy Enforcer\" is TESTIFYING as to how you identified yourself.  The identification you provide happens to contain your full name, address and date of birth.  The only way you could have obtained this licence is either through a birth certificate, citizenship card, or valid passport.  All three of these are revenue streams to Policy Enforcers.  I'm hesitant to publish anything regarding \"driving\" vs. \"travelling\", because I don't want to give the FREE-DUMBERS ammunition.  If you want to travel without a licence, use public or commercial transport, a livery service, or a horse and buggy.  All three options require that somebody pays insurance - the third option is something you must pay.  Paying an insurance POLICY is paying an artificial person to accept SURETY under certain conditions (codes).  Here's where the FREE-DUMBER argument falls down regarding travel and property.\n \n \nYou will hear these arguments from one of two sources.  The first being natives and/or \"aboriginals\"; when they explain the law regarding travel and property, they are telling the truth.  They have LEGAL STANDING to make this declaration, because it says so in countless TREATIES.  When Robert Menard and Dean Clifford make this CLAIM they are simply lying through ommission; because if you are one of the invaders, which you are if you're not native, you benefit from ongoing commercial warfare.  Like it or not, if you are going to share the road with your fellow humans, the issue of SURETY is going to come up, especially if there's an accident.  A deadbeat like Robert Menard is never going to be able to support the needs and medical bills of someone he may have crippled while drunk driving one night.  Here in reality his \"100% responsible declaration\" is bullshit by any LEGAL standard, and no-fault insurance only applies when both parties are insured.  Even a horse and buggy needs a bare minimum of $1,000,000 liability insurance.  I know this because I was once the owner of a horse, and a buggy.\n \n \nIf you haven't read \"Insurance for the Inept\" (appointed by Gail Blackman), you should stop and read it now.  \n \n \nSince 1982 I have run a private navy.  The trust that holds that navy, also has its own currency.  In 2010, the AQUILAE cryptic currency was commissioned, and the need for FIAT currency disappeared, except as regards insurance.\n \n \nWhen you accept that the term \"LEGAL\" is all SURETY and ACCOUNTING, you quickly realize that everything LEGAL has a monetary value.  There are no exceptions to this rule.  Let me repeat that so your empty head will absorb it.  All things legal have a monetary value attached, including SURETY.  The FREE-DUMBER says he can drive without a licence, and he is telling the truth.  The lie of ommision is that you cannot get insurance without a driver's licence.  In Common Law Jurisdictions LEGAL ACTS and STATUTES do not acknowlege your RIGHT to property; whereas in Civil Law Jurisdiction, the RIGHT to property is absolute.  The LEGAL consequences of Robert Menard getting drunk and injuring somebody whilst \"travelling with his property\" will not be accepted by any other party; and the \"wake up and be a FREE-DUMBER\" line doesn't really work when it comes to medical expenses and basic needs.  Some highways are semi-private, and if a FREE-DUMBER drives down those they can expect to have a SWAT team arrest them and seize their \"property\".  This has happened on the 407 ETR more than once.  Like everything else in LAW, FREE-DUMBERS lie through ommission.  It is very easy to produce case law showing the courts acknowledge that use of the roads is in fact, a RIGHT, not a privilege.  There are even high-risk insurance companies that will insure a vehicle without a driver's licence, but the premiums will be $30,000 a year.  \n \n \nBack to \"ARTIFICIAL PERSONS\".  In my first article regarding PERSONS, we covered the fact that NATURAL PERSON = \"Picking up the Tab\".  Accepting and/or identifying yourself as an \"INDIVIDUAL\" means you are deemed to be a NATURAL PERSON.  If you identify yourself as an INDIVIDUAL you are ACCEPTING SURETY by default.  Since you're picking up the tab, the government AGENT, attempting to impose commerce on you, will of course order the most expensive items on the menu.  The courts recognize the government as a PRIVATE PERSON.  If you are in court against your will you might find it useful to demand proof that the government has STANDING as a PRIVATE PERSON.  This also applies in the UNITED STATES.  If the court refuses to provide proof, INFORM the court that you intend to offer as PROOF FOR APPEAL an objection to this presumption of \"PERSONHOOD\" that the court has arbitrarily granted the government, and a demand for $1,000,000 SECURITY FOR COSTS.  In Western Society, SECURITY FOR COSTS is a well-documented RIGHT.  You are basically demanding insurance.  Since it was offered as PROOF FOR APPEAL, and presuming the Appelate Court is following the rules, it virtually guarantees the case will be thrown out on appeal, for exactly the same reasons the government seizes Dean Clifford's property; if it interacts with, and affects others, and it is not insured, it is the government's mandate to remove it from the PUBLIC domain.  If there was nobody on the road except you, it would be ok to drive without insurance.  But there is...so it isn't.  \n \n \nI too can travel the highways without a licence or insurance, because it turns out there are lots and lots of people who will happily drive you anywhere you want to go in exchange for worthless FIAT currency.  Some of them are even good at it.  One of my captains used to make a \"hobby\" out of collecting drivers's licences, and had the bragging rights of claiming he's one of the few people in ONTARIO that has an AZBM licence.  This means if it travels on the road, no matter what it is, he can LEGALLY drive it.  The \"B\" designation is apparently the hardest, because it required learning to drive a school bus.  Apparently the test is rigid but he \"aced it\" because in reality he was just driving a big yellow truck designed to carry children without seat belts.  From a transport perspective children really aren't that heavy a payload.  \n \n \n...I digress.\n \n \nWhen the courts were still following the rules, I always got a big kick out of the fact that you can sell SURETY ahead of time; and the government is compelled to buy it.  If a JUSTICE grants SECURITY FOR COSTS the ATTORNEY GENERAL had better have the budget to cover it, or the case does not move forward.  One PARTY is attempting to affect another, without insurance, just like when a FREE-DUMBER drives without insurance.  \n \n \nMany of you still cannot grasp cryptographic currency from a practical standpoint, yet none of you seem to have any trouble grasping the concept of CANADIAN TIRE money.  CANADIAN TIRE money is issued as coupons that ACT as an internal currency.  In many accounting circles this is often referred to as \"brown currency\", as it is always circulating internally.  Think of the concept of cryptographic currency as you would your own CORPORATION'S version of CANADIAN TIRE money.  Large purchases can be made with CANADIAN TIRE money, but it cannot be exchanged for cash.  However, you are free to exchange CANADIAN TIRE money for any purchase you agree to.  Bars, during charity events, often accept CANADIAN TIRE money at par.  This has the benefit of not being taxable, allowing the business to write-off the consumables as a CAPTIAL LOSS and/or INVESTED CAPITAL depending on the product and/or service being purchased.  Keeping this in mind will remove any confusion you may have regarding creating your own bank/currency.  \n \n \nIf you have accepted THE TENDER FOR LAW which FIAT currency provides, you will accept that the LEGAL MATRIX will deem it fact that the FIAT currency in question is good for \"all debts public and private\".  This is another \"lie of ommission\" that Robert Menard attempted to pipe out in his latest video about me.  If you do not accept the currency in the creation of a debt, then that law doesn't really apply.  I will do absolutely nothing in commerce, especially for government, in exchange for FIAT currency.  I simply do not accept the creation of that debt and/or contract as I have as a matter of PUBIC RECORD RESIGNED from government service.  The INDIVIDUAL and all its titles are LEGALLY CLAIMED under the AQUILAE TRUST.  This means that if the government wishes to impose commerce on me, they must pay that debt first.  They can pay me in LEGAL TENDER, but that's a quarter of a billion dollars; and if I'm given a quarter of a billion dollars worth of economic power over night, 100% of that worthless currency will be used to collapse the banking system and start a war.  Let that serve as a warning to anyone who happens to be seriously considering giving us large amounts of money.  \n \n \nI will work like a slave for any contract that pays me in AQUILAE currency.  AQUILAE currency is valuable money, and the TENDER FOR LAW attached to it, is whatever I say it is.  Why?  Because \"fuck off that's why\"...it's MY currency!  If you don't like it, go shop somewhere else.  Besides, the FREE-DUMBERS say I'm mean.  In their heads, \"nice but inept\" is far better than the truth.  Apparently truth = mean.  As actual legal knowledge starts bleeding out from THE TENDER FOR LAW, and the people from the \"first wave\" are starting to teach others, the revenue streams of the FREE-DUMBER gurus are in serious jeopardy.  Robert Menard and his now notorious \"Scott Duncan is wrong\" Youtube Video, shows the desperation, because now the victims of the FREE-DUMBERS don't have to suck-up the FREE-DUMB excuses like, \"You just payed for my time\", and other bullshit platitudes to deflect SURETY.  Now they have a weapon that hurts.  That weapon is the declaration \"Scott was right again\".  That will cause the victims to come seeking real answers from a MEGA-PERSON...and that's the last kind of PERSON we're going to discuss. Menard can lie about what words mean, and beg for FIAT, while those that listen and understand what I'm desperately trying to hammer into your stultified brains, will the first of the pioneers. The Pioneers PROFIT, and the NEW economy will be YOURS TO COMMAND, but if you fuck it up, you will destroy yourself, just like Menard, only with less alcohol. :D\n \n \nWe'll call it a pseudo-LEGAL term to make the courts happy; and over the next year it's going to make the courts beg for the \"good old days\" of the FREE-DUMBERS.  MEGA-PERSON will be the only real PARTY in Open-Source government.  As you read this now, this sounds as incredible as making your own currency and bank, and learning to administer your affairs so you profit.  The base framework has been layed out over the past 18 months.  Some of you have casually studied, some of you were compelled to study through external forces, and a precious few of you dedicated every last free minute of time to study.  Those precious few of you who fall into that category are the first to scratch their heads when people describe me as \"mean\".  You can call any of the AQUILAE officers or crew 24-hours a day, and all of them are mandated to have the utmost patience and to stay on the phone as long as they're needed - and that's just the \"overflow\" policy.  I personally handle the bulk of the calls.  It's those precious few people that actually keep me going.  When you understand what a PERSON is LEGALLY, and you UNDERSTAND what SURETY is, and who has it, all your concerns about money should just vanish.  It is July 2014.  It is my least profitable year ever.  It has pushed the entire navy and every officer into personal debt, but we maintain the course because we know we have the answer to everything.  We have computer science.  Computer Science is going to replace government.  Observe the wild ride of BITCOIN over the long term and you can observe computer science affecting reality.  The block chain always maintains its regulated growth.  Banks have tried collective pump-and-dump scams; and it immediately returned to its original growth value.  When you look at BITCOIN over its entire existence, the \"unstable\" nature of cryptographic currencies becomes a lot less clear.  There is a measurable straight line.  It's math; and 2 + 2 always equals 4.  It doesn't matter what you believe.\n \n \nOver the next few weeks I will be introducing the component parts of the \"MEGA-PERSON\".  This LEGAL monster will be yours to control.  It's intent is hostile, and its purpose is to destroy millions of dollars in minutes (if it has to).  This will implement governmental change.  A MEGA-PERSON will have the economic power to destroy currency, because I intend to port government and law into the realm of computer science, just as currency already has.  A \"dress rehersal\" is playing out today.  Two competing currencies - one is debt and joinder, sold as \"value\", the other is value with no debt attached, and temporarily no TENDER FOR LAW either.  Etherium is going to change that.  Etherium is THE TENDER FOR LAW attached to a cryptographic currency; and you have an unambiguous way to write the law.  It then becomes evolution through natural selection.  If you write \"bad law\" you have \"bad currency\", and the market will automatically reflect that.  This will plant the first seeds of \"Open Source Government\".  Policy Enforcers will be tasked with the integrity of POLICIES and the rules set out in real time by the people.  You can repurpose these dumb thugs to follow orders enforcing laws that are generated in real time, and the dumb thug in question will be able to verify its authenticity instantly, and to deflect all SURETY for his actions.  The law is written for Etherium, and once implemented, becomes verifiable at each step in any transaction.  The fact the currency is being exchanged means there are two agreeable PARTIES with the computerized government/bank as the TRUSTEE.  We will then make the system compatible with all cultures.  You could write Sharia law into an Etherium contract, and computer science will determine if it's compliant.  Mullas will absolutely love that they can produce mathematical proof that his \"flock\" are \"good Muslims\".  Open Source law has to work for everyone; even those whose cultures and ideologies I personally loathe.  Otherwise it's just more tyranny deployed from someone of noble birth.  If you think things are getting \"hairy\" with competing currencies, wait until a herd of MEGA-PERSONS form a competing government.  \n \n \nAll of this has already started.  Think of me as the anti-Christ of all PERSONS.  Little niche services are already paying participants for their contribution.  Name Coin is a good example. This is a robustly trading currency that pays you for providing DNS services.  Each query that hits your contributing piece of hardware, whether it's your phone, your iPAD or your desktop computer, will pay you in Name Coin.  The payment comes with the query.  The transaction is instantaneous, meaning your phone or your computer pays you for essentially being \"turned on\".  As connectivity becomes more and more standardized, off-the-shelf phones, tablets, laptops and computers can suddenly be a device that pays you instead of costing you.  Staying in the realm of cryptographic currencies, a lot of money can be made by running a currency exchange.  To avoid legal entanglements it is vital that no cryptographic currency that passes into your PERSON's custody ever be converted to FIAT currency.  Accepting the currency is accepting the terms.  The terms are \"LEGAL\", and it has been \"TENDERed\" with PROPER NOTICE.  The JURISDICTION therefore is \"LEGAL\"; and ACCEPTING this currency ACCEPTS THE TENDER FOR LAW attached.  Yes that even applies to MEGA-PERSON; and as we construct MEGA-PERSON you will learn why that LEGAL BINDING alone turns MEGA-PERSON into a dreadful LEGAL weapon.\n \n \nSo let this article serve as PROPER NOTICE that we are constructing MEGA-PERSON; since its mandate is by its very nature hostile and destructive to any and all PERSONS, PRIVATE and/or PUBLIC, who participate in FRAUD OF ANY KIND.  This includes banks and government.  If the government can make slave PERSONS, so can you.  \n \n \nI'm building an Empire of Math, and I don't care if you CONSENT, because reality doesn't care either.  Lead, follow, or get out of the way.  Those are your RIGHTS under Open Source Government until it's deployed.  The law will quite literally be written by the people.  The Common Law will be integrated as much as possible, but more importantly the first wave will only exist to make it easy for the second wave.  Just like in THE TENDER FOR LAW, only on a global scale.  At the moment it sounds ridiculous, but I remind you that two years ago all of you thought that having your own bank/currency was ridiculous too.  I know many of you have actually been affected by my writing/teachings at a very (dare I say?) PERSONAL level.  And to those who feel that way, know that you are the \"first wave\".  You will teach those that follow.  This is a time of war, hence my Churchill-like demeanor, but notice Churchill was immediately booted from office once the war was over.  The same fate awaits me.  The power I'm building for everyone cannot be in my control after all of us have won.  As my beloved Tara has publicly announced that she seeks world domination, one of the first mandates of Open Source Government is to make sure that woman NEVER has control.  Just trust me on this people - of the two of us, I'M the NICE one.\n \n \nAnyway...over the next year, we shall be putting these pieces together.  We are all going to draft law in controlled environments (for this we will use Etherium Alpha).  We are going to leverage open standards for profit (like binding a Facebook account to its own currency), and we are going to put all these pieces together into something you can immediately use for your own personal gain and profit.  This entire process is designed to excessively reward the \"pioneers\".  This is a double-edged sword.  If you attempt to profit off of others, with no consideration (like current banks/government), the market automatically crashes your currency.  Core laws and principles will be determined through universal consensus.  Assembling legal contracts will become as simple as assembling Lego blocks, with the contracts and/or undertakings being as simple, or as complex, as the parties agree upon.  \n \n \nI end this article with a thought that I wish you to ponder.  If all PERSONS have a monetary value attached to them, along with undertakings to various degrees, and like myself you have liened the LEGAL PERSON as PROOF of RESIGNATION from Government Service, and you have affixed a monetary value to that name, and it is now a fact under LAW until you (the Supreme Authority) say otherwise, you can take that value and LEGALLY UNDERWRITE (insure) your own PERSONAL currency.\n \n \n...and that's coming up this year.  I'm going to teach you what the FREE-DUMBERS couldn't...how to monetize your PERSON.  As with everything else I teach, I do not charge money.  Ever!  All you have to do is (NOTE: I'm only writing this to make the FREE-DUMBERS sqwak and cackle), SHUT THE FUCK UP AND DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD.\n \n \nNOTE: You really DO HAVE TO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD!  The price of admission is the acknowledgement and acceptance that all of my AXIOMS are TRUE, and the very first AXIOM is YOU THINK WRONG AND VALUE THE WRONG THINGS.  Over the past 18 months I've shown you why that's true, and how it came to be.  Now we're going to do something about it.  When I'm done everyone will think right, and will value the right things, and if they don't a computer will make them.  Imagine making law that says you specifically must be left alone, and your government enforces it.  Imagine if everybody thinks right, and values the right things.  Natural Law will become written law, all on an exponential curve to evolve our species.  To evolve our societies, and above all, to evolve each and every PERSON.\n\n-Scott Duncan "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_534673063235297","body":"Looking back, I have to say that being charged with assault this past January was actually a good thing.

What do you guys, Admiral, Captain think of this?;\n\nOne of the most important Maxim’s of law is simply thatthe creator controls.\n\nWhen applied to the Federal Reserve System, we can simply read the Federal Reserve Act (primary source) and come to no other conclusion than that the Federal Reserve Board and system was indeed created by Congress. Thus, it is patently incorrect to state that the Federal reserve is independent or separate from government, without first stating that such forms (titles) of independence and separation are only what Congress (the creator) allows in its statutes. Under no circumstances does the Fed act “outside of the law”, for in law the creator always controls.\n\nInversely, there stems confusion by the fact that the Federal Reserve Board is allowed by its creator to make its own rules.\n\nOur Maxim’s of law also state that a fiction of law can make no law.

It is an order of things which does not exist,but which the law prescribe; or authorizes. It differs from presumption, because it establishes as true, something which is false; whereas presumption supplies the proof of something true…The law never feigns what is impossible – fictum est id quod factum non est sed fieri potuit. Fiction is like art; it imitates nature, but never disfigures it it aids truth, but it ought never to destroy it. It may well suppose that what was possible, but which is not, exists; but it will never feign that what was impossible, actually is. Fictions were invented by the Roman praetors, who, not possessing the power to abrogate the law, were nevertheless willing to derogate from it, under the pretense of doing equity. Fiction is the resource of weakness, which, in order to obtain its object, assumes as a fact, what is known to be contrary to truth: when the legislator desires to accomplish his object, he need not feign, he commands. Fictions of law owe their origin to the legislative usurpations of the bench. 4.

I normally let these things play out, because I like to show off how I deal with these ill-prepared \"surprises\".  Often you'll find that when I do something that appears \"Godlike\", closer examination reveals that I'd simply altered small things in the past to engineer my way out of future problems.\n\nI've done this all my life and it makes for some interesting experiences, not the least of which is infiltrators.\n\nToday we're going to talk about infiltrators.\n\nI want to discuss the behaviour, dialogue, and the \"red flags\" that alert you to an infiltrator.  \n\nOne of the great things about being me is that you don't know how much I know about you.  You barely understand the technology you use, and the same is true with infiltrators.  I often do things deliberately \"sloppy\" and even let the odd \"warez\" group onto our network, just to act as a \"Honey Pot\" and to take a bunch of NSA agents out of commission.  For as long as they're looking at the shiny objects I leave around, they are not looking at you.\n\nAn officer, and crew member, of the Tyson were using the Lou Manotti and Roguesupport Nx  accounts, and reading THE TENDER FOR LAW, which is baffling because they have direct access to my entire library...but no accounting for taste.  Contrary to what you may think, THE TENDER FOR LAW is not my best work.  \n\nAnyway, officers and crew of the Tyson noticed a member whose posts consist almost exclusively of wrong answers, erroneous conclusions, out-of-context quotes and numerous calls to violence.  At this point I would like to state that if you're doing anything under the banner of AQUILAE you do not cause or inflict violence.  That is a RIGHT reserved exclusively for officers.  The rules are very simple.  If you're going to inflict violence make sure you're an AQUILAE officer first.  If you check and you find out you are not an AQUILAE officer; DON'T.\n\nNow I try to give all of you the benefit of the doubt.  The poster in question is a regular contributor to THE TENDER FOR LAW, but he only showed up late in the second phase.  \n\n...I'm talking about you, Jason Moreland.  \n\nSo as is my way, we're going to drag you out onto the deck, and disect this problem piece-by-piece.\n\nThe default position it that Mr. Moreland is simply dumb and angry because of what he has discovered.  If no other answer comes up, then that will be the position henceforth.  If this is in fact the case, I remind Mr. Moreland that he thinks wrong, and values the wrong things; which means any intent and/or plans he forms at this point are 100% guaranteed to be based on the wrong things, and the wrong thought-process.  This also means there is a 100% chance of failure...\n\n...SO STOP!\n\nIf this is the case I can \"leverage a negative\", and can use Mr. Moreland's many posts as  \"red flag indicators\" when hunting down infiltrators.  You can find many writings on this subject, however we're just going to deal with the basics.  \n\nThe first indicator of an infiltrator is somebody who is just a little too enthusiastic about the cause in question.  You'll often find them repeatedly asking questions about very basic things while skillfully using their feined ignorance to switch a few words around.  You'll also find Robert Menard doing this shit too, so it's not a hard, fast rule - rather an indicator.  Look for phrases like, \"Are you saying *insert bullshit here*?\", and the presumptuous weasel-word questions that are prefixed with \"Don't you think...\" (I preemptively answer \"NO\" to those).  \n\nSecond indicator are calls to violence.  Nobody understands the urge to inflict violence on these pieces-of-shit more than I do.  If you intend to inflict violence, do it right.  Homicide is very, very easy.  It's stupidly easy.  I guarantee that any one of you could kill ten people with a steak knife before anyone could even form the intent to stop you.  In my books, that's stupidly easy.  If you fuck up killing somebody, you deserve your fate.  Many murders are meticulously planned, and go off without a hitch, but the perpetrator still gets caught.  Never plan FOR violence; plan for AFTER the violence.  The violence itself is just a formality.  It's surprisingly easy to do; and a lot of fun.  It solves a problem, gives closure, and let's you move forward.  I speak from experience.  I can even say right here on this open forum to all the cops watching that I killed that fat piece-of-shit that is your colleague.  I garotted him myself with a guitar string.  I even left a note.  So why aren't I sitting in jail with a bunch of gomers chanting \"cop killer\"?  \n\nThe reason I can say this is that they would have to reveal that the dead land-whale in question sent an Islamic Sand-Nigger out to kill my child; and that's not something your masters want attention drawn to.  Look what I've done since then!  You're not bright enough to put it together, but I've already won.  And now I've got nothing to do with the rest of my life but hunt down those who dared write their signatures endorsing harm to me and to those I love.  You can send all the infiltrators you like.  You can use all the blackmailed confidential informants that you like.  You could spread disinformation...hell you can even call me crazy!  But that's not really going to change anything.  I taught a bunch of idiots on the Internet how to build their own fucking banks.  On Facebook of all things.  Ask yourself what I've done with people who have sworn to live and die at my command.\n\nTo Jason Moreland: If you are an infiltrator, take pause and reflect on what you're doing.  The problem with all infiltrators is that when they read what I write, they know it's true.  It's not opinion, it's not hypothesis, it's not even an expression of feelings.  I strip away the bullshit that most infiltrators exploit.  The many adults that have imaginary friends have learned by watching many examples of what happens to people who don't keep their evil, ignorant, mysogenistic idiology to themselves.  \n\nAll belief is evil.  An infiltrator will laugh with his cop buddies quoting \"Scott is always right\", but you'll never hear them quote, \"All belief is evil\".  As a matter of fact I have it on good authority that they are stricly prohibited from quoting it, even in police reports.  I wonder if you can figure out why.\n\nThis is the only life you get.  I had mine planned out from age nine.  It never occurred to me that the Rule of Law would become corrupted too soon.  Before the year 2000, my only problems with the judiciary was their baffling technological ignorance.  \n\nI wish I'd prepared better for the collapse of the judiciary, but I work with what I have; and even my \"Plan B\" gives me a significantly better standard of living than all of you combined.  All of my actions from 2005 onward are to engineer what I like to call \"Destructive Benefit\".  Like THE TENDER FOR LAW itself all of my long-term plans eventually come to fruition.  You can look back to the older posts and see how foolish you sounded, and since you're on the rollercoaster, you don't really see how fast you're going.  There was going to be a stereotypical \"star pupil\" and a stereotypical \"class clown\".  They just turned out to be exactly opposite of who I thought they'd be.  So when it comes to predictions regarding people as individuals, I am rarely right.  I know how you'll all behave in large numbers, but individually you're all very confusing.  I have women figured out in a very \"low res\" way, but that's as close as I've ever gotten after years of study.  The little I do know is true; the rest is a big question mark for me; and whenever possible I try to engineer that gaping variable out of the equation.  It doesn't matter if you think I'm right or not, in the end...we'll all find out soon enough, just as we always do.  \n\nI think it's a safe bet that I'll be right again.  \n\nJason, if you're an infiltrator, go back to your masters and say you've been caught.  If you're not, then less speaking and more reading.  Pretend you're a Christian.  Pretend that if I discover your imaginary friend, you'll be banned; and all the benefit you get here, you'll just have to wait for.  \n\nI've been going through my vast video collection, and I've discovered what I think are videos of both Menard and Clifford acting all \"you're crazy\" and dismissing cryptographic currency.  Menard was sitting in the middle of a fucking mine when he was saying it.  I really like making people who oppose the right answer look really, really stupid.  That's something the cops and I have in common.  Anything you say will be used against you later on.  \n\nEveryone who hasn't watched the Naomi Wolf, End of America video, please do so now.  It's time to pick sides.  The days of warning are over.  It doesn't matter what you say/think/feel/believe.  Reality doesn't care; and very soon, neither will I, for you will no longer be of any use to me.  I'm giving you the keys to the future.  I'm giving you understanding now, and I ask nothing in return.  All I ask is that you share your knowledge with others.  Make sure they know how you learned, because then they'll know when they see an AQUILAE Battle Standard, they should stop what they're doing and walk away, knowing that by doing so they will never be harmed by anyone acting under that banner.  An example of the AQUILAE Battle Standard is on Lou Manotti's profile, and if you see it anywhere else you should stop whatever you're doing, and walk away - because shit's about to get real.  I'm talking about actual, real-life, bikini girls with machine guns.\n\nTake it away guys! Like THIS, only real! youtube.com Profound lyrics too!

Myths about THIS shit, sure has “done the rounds”, hasn't it? No more myths have been generated, out of a piece of regulation, than the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE!\n\nThe dumbed-down, but very accurate, explanation is that the UCC is a standardized LEGAL mechanism, to resolve disputes in commerce, where such commerce utilizes the world reserve currency.\n\nAt the moment, the world reserve currency is the US DOLLAR.  This doesn't mean it's American law, but it most certainly covers the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA and all the US shores and waterways.  \n\nITS DEFAULT ROLE IS TO DETERMINE JURISDICTION\n\nIf you watched Money as Debt III, you saw a brief explanation as to WHY gold became a world currency.  It was universally accepted, around the world.\n\nThe UCC provides this very same function by being the very LAW you TENDERED when you used the US DOLLAR.  This effectively means the UCC covers the UNITED STATES and any JURISDICTIONS, real or implied, which can and/or do use the US DOLLAR.\n\nIn order to make use of the UCC, you must either be in the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, and/or in one of the waters, shores or tributaries of the UNITED STATES, and/or conducting business in US DOLLARS.  \n\nI, for one, love the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.  If you have a fleet of ships and you do business in AMERICAN DOLLARS, and don't have any debt, you're pretty much as free as a human being can get in 2013.\n\nIf there is anyone that says the UCC is anything else, they are, in fact, lying to you.  The purpose behind the UCC is to have COMMON INTERNATIONAL LAW regarding COMMERCE. ABOVE ALL;ITS DEFAULT ROLE IS TO DETERMINE JURISDICTION!\n\n...idiots. (Yes, as a matter of fact I DO have to say that! FUCK OFF!)\n\nThe UCC allows certain presumptions regarding accounting that would simply be impractical in a corporate environment.  The fact that roles are clearly defined, and MARITIME ADMIRALTY LAW is heavily integrated, makes owning a ship, or even better, a fleet of ships, a very liberating idea, for the UCC protects you. The UCC guarantees that other users of THE TENDER FOR LAW that offered this JURISDICTION, will protect your interests by presumption.  \n\nThis whole “Dean arrest thing” has distracted me from my larger goal, and now I have to stop and dumb things down.  I certainly hope my explanation of the UCC is clear enough.\n\nNow ponder how stupid a CLAIM against such “constructs” actually is.\nOK, you know what?...you're all too stupid...I'm going to have to explain it.\n\nLet's cover a few fundamentals.  I'll try not to use large words so the “BELIEVERS” won't get confused.\n\nA TRUST IS NOT A PERSON.  \n\nA GOVERNMENT IS NOT A PERSON, AND\n \nA JUDICIARY IS NOT A PERSON.\n\nA human that is registered with the NON-PERSON GOVERNMENT IS A PERSON.\n\nA human, and that stripper they fucked last year and has since squirted out a NEW human, and THEREFORE, said NEW human is registered with the NON-PERSON GOVERNMENT IS A PERSON. (That's what you get for fucking strippers) \n\nA CORPORATION IS A PERSON.\n\nONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD poses as a “TRUST”.  A TRUST cannot make a CLAIM.  Only a PERSON can make a CLAIM.  \n\nThe GRANTORS of the TRUST have NO STANDING to make a CLAIM once the TRUST is commissioned.  They have no more power to do so than the guy, whose signature is on a Ten Dollar bill, has the AUTHORITY to tell you how to spend it.\n\nONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, and their ilk, will happily talk as EXPERTS on the UCC, and I'm pretty sure NONE of them has actually used the UCC.\n\nSo, let's do a side-by-side comparison as to who is more qualified to speak on this subject:\n\nI, unlike OPPF and “FREELOADERS-ON-THE-LAND”, have actual VALUE.  As I type this the general consensus of the LEGAL AND BANKING SYSTEM says that I can, without question, UNDERWRITE half a Billion Dollar's worth of BONDS converted to MONEY OF EXCHANGE.  Think about that.  On a whim, I could inject half a Billion Dollars into the economy.  This means that unless you use those dollars to purchase my value, the entire net worth of the country will drop by half a Billion Dollars.  \n\nIf you think it's frightening that one privileged man wields the power to do this sort of thing, pat yourself on the back because that is the proper response.  Ethics is the only thing that stops me from doing that.  But that doesn't really help much in COMMERCE.  An ethical guy with a gun, in the end, is still just a guy with a gun....\n\n….Enter the UCC.\n\nThe UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE in COMMERCE, only recognizes whatever currency is the world reserve currency.  This of course is the US DOLLAR.  This means that every other currency touched by the INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND is simply “acting” as a US DOLLAR (or part thereof).\nMuammar Gaddafi was wiped off the face of the earth, because he dared point out that the world's currencies are propping-up the dead, hollowed-out carcass that is the UNITED STATES.  He raised the point that, according to the little, green book that got him into office, He was pretty sure that LIBYA'S economic wealth was to go to its people.\n\nI hear people stating that the war on LIBYA was ILLEGAL.  Sadly it wasn't.  The UCC made it perfectly LEGAL.  \n\nLAW IS A TRUST.  According to the TRUST, Gaddafi's attempt to change the currency was a BREACH OF THAT TRUST.  \n\nTHE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE can be viewed as the grand, de facto law that exists where no other de facto law exists.  \n\nTherefore according to IMF TREATIES, if there's no law at a particular place, the UCC is DEEMED to be the de facto law.\n\nYou will notice that there is nothing to LIEN or FORECLOSE ON in the UCC.  UCC is a “legal traffic cop”, directing traffic to its appropriate JURISDICTION.  \n\nTreating a TRUST like a PERSON makes any further documents produced as a result, FRAUD. Such documents are OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT.  \n\nIn short, ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD is, by its very nature, based on an ILLEGAL concept.\n\n...but that's not the worst of it. UCC, like any OTHER TRUST is based on CONSENT. Let's look into LEGAL UTOPIA! We needn't bother with silly things like consent. IT'S LEGAL PARADISE! First we must get into the right “headspace”. \n\nSince all of you like to form uninformed opinions of me, and what a bad man I am, I'll put this next scenario in the context of “me”, because your self-created loathing of me will allow you to accept this concept, in your empty little heads.\n\nSO, Imagine if you will that I, the KEEPER OF THE AQUILAE TRUST, decided that I wanted to do something FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, because you're too stupid to do it yourself.  With the arrogant presumption that I even have STANDING to do so, I, without your CONSENT, make a DECLARATION that you get a “chunk of the world's wealth”; and to ENFORCE that I drafted some AWESOME LAWS, as I do not “believe” (belief is the only thing that would cause a rational human being to think this way) you are capable of managing your own affairs...\n\n...hey wait, this is starting to sound familiar.  But I'm not like the GOVERNMENT, I know what's best for you!  I'm just here to help;  and anybody who doesn't want that help is clearly a “hater”, and are jealous... maybe even criminals and psychopaths.  Why, anybody who doesn't want my help is mentally ill.  That's safe to say!  In fact, I'd better amend my awesome laws so that I may lovingly and humanely dispose of these mentally ill.\n\nGot the picture?\n\nGOOD.\n\nNow just replace “me” with those “three guys” in ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, and that is what is being sold to you.  I cannot make this any clearer.\n\nI have just explained what the UCC is.  If you think it's anything else, you're “making shit up”.\n\nI use the UCC daily.  AQUILAE has points-of-presence in CANADA, THE UNITED STATES, SINGAPORE, SCOTLAND and ICELAND.  So anybody who dares say they know more about the UCC is publicly declaring that I am LEGALLY INCOMPETENT TO MANAGE A TRUST, which is DEFAMATORY; and I deal with that in MY JURISDICTION, and there's a nice “legal traffic cop” that says I can.  People who want to continue spreading bullshit may find themselves on my “LEGAL AUTOPSY TABLE” where they are used as a live example...\n\n...Because ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD has a lot more than the UCC.  I could show mercy right now and let this FRAUD die as it is; and even though I made some grandiose promises about this document's horrible fate, I remind you all that mercy is the mark of a GREAT MAN!\n\n...The problem is, I'm just a GOOD man.  \n\nIn my next major post I shall cover the procedural FRAUD within the TRUST itself as laid-out in its CHARTER DOCUMENTS.\n\nWatch how it writhes in pain.  * maniacal giggling is permitted * "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_681348068567795","body":"In case you were wondering about the injection of LEGALESE into the English Language...\n\n...it's all about Shakespeare and \"Olde English\".

This is article number two in as many days!\n\nDerek Moran says that he finds it difficult to believe that I will be able to top the SURETY article...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. \n\nIt is almost midnight on Sunday, I'm on the bridge of the Tycho-Brahe, and as I look out onto the lake the water is like a sheet of glass...and it's not even frozen.  How can I not produce a superior article tonight?  So today, with all my \"God\" complex, \"arrogance\", and the knowledge that a host of \"pseudo radio\" is reading my superior work, and knowing that all he can do is tremble in impotent fury.  Things are so good I can cover the bad aspects of law, namely its language.\n\nSome of you may have already started to figure this out, but every single word in a legal document is designed specifically for the purpose of trapping you.  Even words like AND, OR, IS, MAY, SHOULD...all of these are traps!  And law dictionaries use them perfectly.  You may have noticed words like UNDERSTAND don't mean what you think they mean.  This is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit in the legal world.  What I am about to teach you here is the legalese equivalent of \"code breaking\".  \n\nLet's jump back to the 1500's...\n\nThis is the time in our civilization that we often refer to as the Renaissance.  The reason the Renaissance occurred is that whole shitloads of people were dying of various forms of plague, and rat-shit-covered scientists were baffled as to why this virulent disease was spreading everywhere.  \n\nThe practical result of all this was that a whole shitload of people died, and the ones that made it, inherited all their possessions.  Efforts to communicate more efficiently became a social priority, because there was lots to do to maintain all this new property, and not enough people to do it.  For nearly 800 years \"God\" was everything, despite his demonstrable lack of assistance in this era.  You see the age where \"God\" was everything was called the \"dark ages\".  Every time I hear an adult with an \"imaginary friend\" talk about how \"ignorant and closed-minded\" I am, all I see is an individual that wishes to return to that horrible time.  \n\nAs there were fewer people in the 1500's, and the Renaissance was just getting underway, inherited art was often used as currency.  The next generation had a higher literacy rate than the previous, and so administrative rules were born.  It doesn't take a \"Rocket Scientist\" to see how useful slipping Shakespeare in around the latter half of the 1500's would be to those few who don't actually do any work.  The false profession of \"law\" was born.\n\nYou'll notice that nobody ever \"does\" law.  They only \"practice\" it.  They keep practising and practising, but they never quite get it right (that's what you get for not subscribing to the TENDER FOR LAW!).  \n\nFrom the 1500's to the present, there has been an odd phenomenon regarding language.  English is a Germanic language that merged with the language of the Angols (we will discuss the Angols and the Picts in another article).  Germanic influence on the language of the Angols resulted in the Latin-to-English written in the MAGNA CARTA.  But if you try to learn German today, you'll notice an interesting phenomenon.  Though the words you use sound startlingly similar, and the really observant can actually pick out the words when German speak and get a general idea of what they're saying, even if they don't speak the language.  Except further study shows that the Germans speak \"backwards\" grammatically.  Jumping to the south-west, Spanish, a much simpler language, where every vowel is a syllable, and words say what they mean, but once again, \"grammatically backwards\".  Head north-east in our mental European map...to France...well France is filled with French people so we needn't bother with them.  Those French have a different word for everything, and their language is, you guessed it, \"grammatically backwards\".  \n\nThose of you noticing the pattern here will not be using too much intellect when they start posing the question, \"Maybe we're the ones that are backwards\".  And that is almost, but not quite true.\n\nLike a virus, legalese infected the English language.  It's encouraged to this day to use legalese to appear \"smart\".  This is done on purpose.  It is an insidious piece of social engineering.\n\nThey want you to try to use these words without knowing what the little words mean.\n\nIT'S ALL ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS.\n\nWhen you read, you read from left to right on a page.  The small words actually exclude part of the sentence.  You will notice in my now famous, NOTICE OF MISTAKE, that I always use \"and/or\".  I do this on purpose, because I like to keep my options open.  \n\nMaxims of Law say it plainly.  The inclusion of one thing excludes all others.  The definition of a PERSON in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA is the most hysterical example of this. The definition of PERSON is hidden in the larger scope of \"every one\".  The common law maxim, \"The INCLUSION of one is the exclusion of another\" means in the context of the CRIMINAL CODE INCLUDES \"Her Majesty\" AND an \"organization\".  See for yourself:\n\n*** THE CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA***\n“every one”, “person” and “owner”\n\n« quiconque », « individu », « personne » et « propriétaire »\n\n    “every one”, “person” and “owner”, and similar expressions, include Her Majesty and an organization;\n\n**********************************\n\nYou will find this by searching for R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 under the Interpretations Section.\n\nIn reality, what this says is that a \"PERSON\" is \"HER MAJESTY\".  Unless you are \"HER MAJESTY\" people answering to these acts and statutes are simply \"performing these acts\" (remember Shakespeare) on \"HER MAJESTY's\" behalf, much like the GOVERNOR GENERAL PERFORMS royal duties on the Queen's behalf.  This is why the GOVERNOR GENERAL is always a chosen CITIZEN, and not an elected official.  \n\nThe GOVERNOR GENERAL ACTS as the Queen when the Queen is not in town.  This of course has nothing to do with \"HER MAJESTY\".\n\nWhen dealing with the LAW, in CANADA anyway, you are always dealing with \"HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA\", which as we all know is a CORPORATE ORGANIZATION.  \n\n\"OR\" means you have a choice, \"one\" OR the \"other\", but not BOTH. \n\nSo, in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA, a PERSON can be \"HER MAJESTY\".  A PERSON can be \"HER MAJESTY\", but a PERSON must also be an \"ORGANIZATION\".  Notice it does not say \"OR\" an organization in the above interpretation.  Confused yet?\n\nThat happens in Legalese. Let's, instead of looking at this dry, depressing CRIMINAL CODE stuff, look at something happy, exciting and real.  \n\nI can say with absolute certainty that no woman on the planet has loved me more than Tara.  However, no amount of love would compel her to JOINDER herself to a \"BILL OF LADING\", and hand it over to the GOVERNMENT. That means \"getting married\" (for the stupid amongst you).  I'm sorry if that sounds condescending (that means talking down to people).  \n\nNow think about this marriage transaction.  The marriage INCLUDES \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", not \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\".  This means marriage makes you effectively ONE PERSON UNDER THE LAW.  Since the marriage actually consists of THREE ENTITIES, \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", which by its nature EXCLUDES the GOVERNMENT, still remains an \"ORGANIZATION\".  A marriage ORGANIZES these \"entities\" into their respective roles.  If \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\" remain \"Scott AND Tara\", the GOVERNMENT HAS NO STANDING.  However, if Tara sought a divorce, the MARRIED PERSON is no longer \"Scott AND Tara\", and the GOVERNMENT gets to intervene.\n\nThis most certainly wouldn't be the case if it was \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\".  Therefore, the above CRIMINAL CODE definition of \"PERSON\" defines HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ***INSERT PROVINCE HERE***, which is both \"HER MAJESTY\" AND an \"ORGANIZATION\".  \n\nEvery one who is CHARGED in CANADA is usually CHARGED by their PROVINCE.  For instance, if I were to take the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD lawyer \"Heather\" and bash her skull into jelly with a ball-peen hammer (as she so richly deserves), I would likely be CHARGED with HOMICIDE in the JURISDICTION where I chose to do this \"skull-bashing\".  As I'm a profoundly lazy man I probably wouldn't travel, so ONTARIO would be the JURISDICTION.  This makes \"HER MAJESTY\" AND the \"ORGANIZATION\", \"HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO\".  Since all ACTS and STATUTES fall to PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of \"HER MAJESTY\", this makes all PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of \"HER MAJESTY\" effectively \"HER MAJESTY\".  HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO is in fact, an \"ORGANIZATION\".  You now have the qualifications for a \"PERSON\" as defined in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA.\n\nJust as the \"marriage\" consists of \"Scott AND Tara\", which effectively creates an \"ORGANIZATION\", \"HER MAJESTY\" and the organization defined as \"IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO\" create a \"PERSON\" which YOU are presumed to be a PUBLIC SERVANT of.  This effectively means all CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS are simply administrative processes for that \"ORGANIZATION\".  The NOTICE OF MISTAKE effectively removes that presumption.\n\nYou now see how powerful the words \"and\" and \"or\" are.  If AQUILAE says the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is \"Scott AND Tara\", this would mean neither of us individually could act as CAPTAIN, but \"Scott and Tara\" could BOTH be CAPTAIN.  This means that all ORDERS from the CAPTAIN must come from BOTH Scott AND Tara.  However, the AQUILAE TRUST is not a stupid document, and the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott OR Tara.  This means that when Tara speaks, everyone shuts the fuck up...including me.  It's Scott OR Tara - not BOTH!\n\n\"AND\" refers to BOTH.  \"OR\" does not.  This is why putting \"and/or\" gives you the options; and since the AQUILAE TRUST is pretty much perfect, here in reality, the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott and/or Tara.\n\nThis means I can ACT as CAPTAIN, Tara can ACT as CAPTAIN, and we can BOTH ACT as CAPTAIN.  Recipients of this POLICY have NO STANDING to contest when we assume and/or drop the role of CAPTAIN.  Why do we do this, you ask?  Because FUCK OFF, THAT'S WHY!  If you're even looking at the AQUILAE TRUST, you're a fucking TRUSTEE; and the only reason you should be looking at the AQUILAE TRUST is to find the best way to \"Shut the fuck up and do what you're told\" for Scott and/or Tara....\n\nAnd that is how you make a powerful LEGAL document with the words \"and/or\", and the reason why we write things this way.  Use AND & OR to restrict other parties.  Use BOTH (and/or) to free yourself.\n\nIf your document is stating the terms, make it as open as possible for YOU, and as restrictive as possible for every OTHER PARTY.  If somebody is thought of as a \"good lawyer\", it means they have mastered this skill.  Were I to be practising law, I would be a very, very good lawyer. \n\nOne of our loyal readers made the horrendous mistake of using different words, in another post.  Instead of NOTICE OF MISTAKE he said, NOTICE OF \"ERROR\", which means something completely different.  If you look up the legal definition of \"mistake\" you will notice amongst other things (inter alia) the legal definition of \"MISTAKE\" ends with \", or error\".  If you are going to learn from the TENDER FOR LAW, you must always remember the Number 1 Rule of the Universe:\n\nSCOTT IS ALWAYS RIGHT!\n\nYou can save yourself a lot of time by NOT second-guessing Scott, and proceeding to figure out WHY Scott is right.  \n\nThis also means that when I present a document you should presume it's perfect, and that changing it will fuck you over in ways you don't even understand.  \"NOTICE OF ERROR\" is not \"NOTICE OF MISTAKE\".  You don't change the document because you think it \"sounds cooler\".  You don't change the document because you think another cooler-sounding word means the same thing; and I will always interpret such changes as TENDERING AN OFFER to amuse me, by allowing me to berate you for your stupidity, and to laugh at you when a court kicks your ass.  This is a TENDER I will gladly ACCEPT and volunteer for, with the added bonus that I will execute my duties in this TENDER to the best of my abilities.  I'm really good at that too.  \n\nTaking what you have just learned here and reading through ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, will reveal some very interesting and insidious things.  You're better off serving me as a slave, because unlike ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, I won't lie to you, and I'll tell you exactly what I mean.  \n\nSo there you have it, AND & OR - two hidden keys to legalese and the knowledge that \"include also excludes\"...and before you ask EXCLUDES includes all that remains.  Use EXCLUDE to get rid of everything else; use INCLUDE to restrict to a single point/item.\n\nThe guy with the fake \"charity\" seeking legal advice actually asked what TENDER means, and it occurs to me that those who AREN'T lying to me might wonder too. TENDER in the context of Law means, \"to present to PERSON, an unconditional offer, to enter into a contract\". Look at those words, then look at a bank note. THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER means, \"THIS NOTE IS AN UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW\". That is why the group name is so clever. ;) This group is ABOUT that UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW. It's ALL money.\n\nMoney is JOINDER. JOINDER MAY (Read as: \"ALWAYS DOES\") INCLUDE SURETY!\n\nTHIS is the LEGALESE you need to know. NO MORE. Your ONLY goal should be to REMOVE and/or AVOID SURETY when dealing in commerce and/or LAW. WHEN YOU SIGN A CHEQUE, you are TENDERING SURETY. A BANK NOTE does NOT THENDER SURETY as the SURETY is signed for, by SOMEBODY ELSE.\n\nIf you have OTHER LEGALESE questions, post them in the comments. OFF TOPIC COMMENTS WILL BE DELETED.

In one of our many exciting and engaging threads, Pierre asked the following questions:\n\n1). Do you really think some government agents are following this group?\n\nand\n\n2). If some do, are they NOT just going to quit their stupid jobs and figure out that they are really missing the boat ?\n\nThis is a complex issue and deserved an article on its own.\n\nI am currently resurfacing the upper deck of the Tycho-Brahe and you should all feel really guilty that this, writing endeavour, is interrupting my hot, back-breaking manual labour which involves necessary but otherwise pointless suffering...so you'd better appreciate everything this has to offer.\n\n1st question: “Do you really think some government agents are following this group?”\n\nAnswering this one is really easy:  Yes. In fact they've said so.\n\nTo think otherwise would imply a level of self-deception that would probably render you catatonic.  In fact, the only reason this group exists is because I KNOW the GOVERNMENT is reading it.  Everything I type here I type ON PURPOSE.  \n\nAs often as they try to insert a voice, their efforts get rendered futile by the rules of my little autocracy here.  Jimmy Carter once commented that the reason he was such an effective diplomat was that he always dealt with dictatorships...and shit gets done under dictatorships.\n\nMy policy eliminates the flawed notion that your ignorance is equal to my knowledge.  There's no “fair and balanced” here, there's right and wrong.  The only freedom you have here is to get the fuck out and never come back – you're free to do that at any time.  It is MY autocracy.  I made it, and I shall rule it as long as I deem necessary.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause “FUCK OFF” that's why!\n\nWith every word I type (or dictate ;)) my goal for THE TENDER FOR LAW is being fulfilled.  As far as you should be concerned it serves no other purpose.\n\n2nd question: “If some do, are they NOT just going to quit their stupid jobs and figure out that they are really missing the boat?”  The short answer is, “No”, and the reasons why, are systemic.  \n\nAsk yourself, “What is a government worker?”  \n\nWhen you, ACTUALLY LOOK, and realize that they don't actually do anything; they don't make anything, and any benefit they get (including their salaries) was taken from someone else, this becomes PAINFULLY clear, and you wonder how you thought they were anything else.\n\nIf you try to get a government job, it's very difficult...unless you are related-to, and/or know someone, who already works for the government.  \n\nEvery once in a while the issues of nepotism and crony-ism crops up by vocal members of the public, and the expensive, time-consuming and inevitably pointless “public hearing” on the issue will make a “500-page legal ruling” which essentially says “We agree that nepotism and crony-ism is a bad thing”, and the issue is considered closed (..except for the collection of tax dollars that will be needed to fund this \"fair and balanced\" report, of course!).\n\nSuch cancers on the PUBLIC TRUST aren't terminal in a healthy government, especially if policies exist to expel them; and to destroy the problem before it becomes a problem.\n\nEvery government in the Commonwealth has such a legal mechanism – referendums being the most familiar.  Even with those protections, you will find that everyone, in every Commonwealth county, will feel the same way about government workers!  \n\nThey have gone from being “holders of the PUBLIC TRUST” to “worthless eaters at the trough”.  Though it's hard to imagine; I want you to picture yourself at a point in life (say, in your 40's or 50's) where you know, beyond any reasonable doubt, that you can't actually do anything, don't actually know anything, and can provide nothing that anybody wants.  This makes you perfect for government work!\n\nDo you honestly think a government worker doesn't know he/she is a worthless sack of shit?  \n\nDo you really think the fat, useless old man who holds the Senior Government position, once bounced on his father's lap and said, “Daddy, can I push paper for the Attorney General when I grow up?”  \n\nAnd do you think his daddy looked at him with hope and pride, exclaiming, “You can be anything you want son”!\n\nWhat about Children's Aid Society workers (CAS)?  Do you really think the fat, ugly, tub-of-shit that no man would fuck on a dare, muchless have a baby with, once crushed her mother's lap, and said, “Mommy, can I steal other people's children when I grow up?”  \n\nNO!\n\nThat ugly sack of shit, sees herself in the mirror in the morning, and knows, absolutely and categorically, that she's an ugly sack-of-shit, who's bitter, and harms those who have what she wants, and calling it \"important work\".\n\nThat fat, middle-aged man pushing paper for the Attorney General, also knows he's a useless sack-of-shit who couldn't make a living in the real world.\n\nNot only do they read what I'm writing, they know, FOR A FACT, that what I'm saying is true! \n\nUnfortunately for all of US; for them to acknowledge that, would be to cut off the revenue stream, that feeds their families, at other people's expense.\n\nSo yes, Pierre, they do watch, and they do know what I'm saying is true.\n\nIt just doesn't matter to them; because the only way they can have the illusion of self-actualization and worth, and to feed their families, is to be worthless, useless, child-stealing sacks-of-shit.  Would you let your family starve?\n\nIf the only way you could feed your family would be to assume the role of paper-pushing/child-stealing/citizen-beating/home-invading, worthless sack-of-shit...wouldn't you do it?\n\nThe infrastructure of the government consists of middle-aged, stupid/incapable people, who where brought into the position, by a previous generation of middle-aged/stupid people, who were brought in by a previous generation of people who fought in a bloody, pointless war and chose to avail themselves of the benefits of “Civil Service”.  \n\nThere was a time, right here in Canada, that you weren't paid to work for the government.  You did it as “service”, and you were rightfully revered for the position, for it was a position of TRUST. Only after 1933, was government ever a way to “make a living”.  Here in reality, government workers make YOUR LIVING. They take from you, to breed another generation of stupid/incapable people that the real world doesn't want.\n\nThe “real world” doesn't want me either, but I am not responsible for the wants and desires of others (although Tara will tell you I am in fact responsible for every want and desire she has...and I'd best make sure she has them if I know what's good for me...I digress).\n\nSo...just remember that Pierre, every worthless, sack-of-shit in government already knows they're a worthless, sack-of-shit.\n\nOne of my larger goals in my public initiatives (THE TENDER FOR LAW being but one of them), is to eventually provide absolute, conclusive, irrefutable proof, so when you try to wake up your friends and neighbours, you won't have to say, “I know a guy who knows a guy”...you will be able to point to it and to say, “Here's the proof.”  \n\nRemember I'm the guy who pays all his taxes, who PAID OFF his mortgage, and had guns pointed at him and his home stolen, because he would not cede jurisdiction, and would not have his UNALIENABLE RIGHT not to contract ignored.\n\nEverything has been meticulously documented, and the corruption of the system will become self-evident.  When they question the “authorities” about what I say, the response will only reinforce my position.\n\nI want the government the way it SHOULD be; TERRIFIED of its citizens.  Those with authority in the PUBLIC TRUST should have sleepless nights worrying about what the citizenry might do to them if they step out of line.\n\nPUBLIC TRUST and PRIVATE TRUST is no different.  You will have no problem seeing the nature and depth of the offence, when somebody betrays your trust, and I'm sure you have no problem expressing it when it happens.  Yet people in the PUBLIC TRUST, when they do the same, get away with saying, “Ya, well...that's just the way it is. C'est la vie.”  \n\nWhy is that?\n\nWhy is one breach of trust unforgivable, but the other is “just the way it is”?\n\nEVERYTHING IN GOVERNMENT IS ENGINEERED TO MAINTAIN THAT “JUST THE WAY IT IS” MENTALITY IN THE PUBLIC.  IT SERVES NO OTHER PURPOSE.\n\n...and to counter the inevitable, “we need government for hospitals, roads and schools”, as if these things don't occur as a matter of course:  Even the most backward, primitive villages in Tzshitholeistan, will have a road coming into the village, and executive to administer policy, and minimal “public services” to accommodate the village.\n\nAll we have left now is worthless people who contribute nothing, implementing “Might makes right” policies, if you dare say ANYTHING against the cry “Respect MA ATHORITAH”!\n\nYou have but to look over at Dean Clifford to see this mentality in play.  Those very same government workers who know that they're worthless sacks-of-shit living off your labour to feed their worthless sack-of-shit families [hereafter: Worthless breeder], look at people like me publishing what I do, and people like Dean, publishing what he does, and even the Grand Poobah of the FREE-DUMB Movement, Robert Menard, and you can imagine the pressure they are feeling.  For anyone examining the issue, at bare minimum will conclude, that ONE of us is right; and that what exists right now, is NOT EVEN CLOSE to \"RIGHT\".\n\nLike a cornered animal, I feel these worthless breeders will actually harm Dean Clifford, and that's a bell that can't be un-rung.  Too many people will see this happen.  I'll make sure of that.  \n\nSo to conclude, \n\n1: Thank you Pierre, for finally asking something relevant; and I no longer think you're a waste of oxygen that should be ground up for filler, in pet food.\n\n2: It is unlikely that anyone observing these pages for, or on behalf of, any government entity will assimilate the message, change their opinions, or become a force for public good.  Those who live fantasy existences, whether inspired by religion, wealth, or a job in the public sector, cannot afford to let even the smallest amount of doubt seep into their “realities”. They can't, without questioning every facet of who, and what, they are. \n\nIn seeking to maintain their view of the status quo, they will fight, by whatever means necessary, to maintain their rose-coloured illusions that everything is fine and nothing is broken.\n\nUltimately if they cannot stem the tide of public opinion by sticking their fingers in their ears, they will even seek to silence those with dissenting opinions. To do otherwise would force them to acknowledge themselves as dysfunctional and an integral part of a broken system.

It is little understood in that light, primarily because the remnants of protest groups still exist, but no longer wish to appear to be \"anti-government.\" They don’t talk much about these roots. Few even know them. We need to go back in time about 400 years to find this success. It succeeded only because the term \"jurisdiction\" was still well understood at that time as meaning \"oath spoken.\" \"Juris,\" in the original Latin meaning, is \"oath.\" \"Diction\" as everyone knows, means \"spoken.\" The protest obviously didn’t happen here. It occurred in England. Given that the origins of our law are traced there, most of the relevant facts in this matter are still applicable in this nation. Here’s what happened.\n\nThe Bible had just recently been put into print. To that time, only the churches and nobility owned copies, due to given to the extremely high cost of paper. Contrary to what you’ve been taught, it was not the invention of movable type that led to printing this and other books. That concept had been around for a very long time. It just had no application. Printing wastes some paper. Until paper prices fell, it was cheaper to write books by hand than to print them with movable type. The handwritten versions were outrageously costly, procurable only by those with extreme wealth: churches, crowns and the nobility. The wealth of the nobility was attributable to feudalism. \"Feud\" is Old English for \"oath.\" The nobility held the land under the crown. But unimproved land, itself, save to hunter/gatherers, is rather useless. Land is useful to farming. So that’s how the nobility made their wealth. No, they didn’t push a plow. They had servants to do it. The nobility wouldn’t sell their land, nor would they lease it. They rented it. Ever paid rent without a lease? Then you know that if the landlord raised the rent, you had no legal recourse. You could move out or pay. But what if you couldn’t have moved out? Then you’d have a feel for what feudalism was all about.\n\nA tenant wasn’t a freeman. He was a servant to the (land)lord, the noble. In order to have access to the land to farm it, the noble required that the tenant kneel before him, hat in hand, swear an oath of fealty and allegiance and kiss his ring (extending that oath in that last act to the heirs of his estate). That oath established a servitude. The tenant then put his plow to the fields. The rent was a variable. In good growing years it was very high, in bad years it fell. The tenant was a subsistence farmer, keeping only enough of the produce of his labors to just sustain him and his family. Rent was actually an \"income tax.\" The nobleman could have demanded 100% of the productivity of his servant except . . . under the common law, a servant was akin to livestock. He had to be fed. Not well fed, just fed, same as a horse or cow. And, like a horse or cow, one usually finds it to his benefit to keep it fed, that so that the critter is productive. Thus, the tenant was allowed to keep some of his own productivity. Liken it to a \"personal and dependent deductions.\"\n\nThe freemen of the realm, primarily the tradesmen, were unsworn and unallieged. They knew it. They taught their sons the trade so they’d also be free when grown. Occasionally they took on an apprentice under a sworn contract of indenture from his father. His parents made a few coins. But the kid was the biggest beneficiary. He’d learn a trade. He’d never need to become a tenant farmer. He’d keep what he earned. He was only apprenticed for a term of years, most typically about seven. The tradesmen didn’t need adolescents; they needed someone strong enough to pull his own weight. They did not take on anyone under 13. By age 21 he’d have learned enough to practice the craft. That’s when the contract expired. He was then called a \"journeyman.\" Had he made a journey?\n\nNo. But, if you pronounce that word, it is \"Jur-nee-man.\" He was a \"man,\" formerly (\"nee\"), bound by oath (\"jur).\" He’d then go to work for a \"master\" (craftsman). The pay was established, but he could ask for more if he felt he was worth more. And he was free to quit. Pretty normal, eh? Yes, in this society that’s quite the norm. But 400 some years ago these men were the exceptions, not the rule. At some point, if the journeyman was good at the trade, he’d be recognized by the market as a \"master\" (craftsman) and people would be begging him to take their children as apprentices, so they might learn from him, become journeymen, and keep what they earned when manumitted at age 21! The oath of the tenant ran for life. The oath of the apprentice’s father ran only for a term of years. Still, oaths were important on both sides. In fact, the tradesmen at one point established guilds (means \"gold\") as a protection against the potential of the government attempting to bind them into servitudes by compelled oaths.\n\nWhen an apprentice became a journeyman, he was allowed a membership in the guild only by swearing a secret oath to the guild. He literally swore to \"serve gold.\" Only gold. He swore he’d only work for pay! Once so sworn, any other oath of servitude would be a perjury of that oath. He bound himself for life to never be a servant, save to the very benevolent master: gold! (Incidentally, the Order of Free and Accepted Masons is a remnant of one of these guilds. Their oath is a secret. They’d love to have you think that the \"G\" in the middle of their logo stands for \"God.\" The obvious truth is that it stands for \"GOLD.\")\n\nThen the Bible came to print. The market for this tome wasn’t the wealthy. They already had a handwritten copy. Nor was it the tenants. They were far too poor to make this purchase. The market was the tradesmen - and the book was still so costly that it took the combined life savings of siblings to buy a family Bible. The other reason that the tradesmen were the market was that they’d also been taught how to read as part of their apprenticeship. As contractors they had to know how to do that! Other than the families of the super-rich (and the priests) nobody else knew how to read.\n\nThese men were blown away when they read Jesus’ command against swearing oaths (Matt 5: 33-37). This was news to them. For well over a millennia they’d been trusting that the church - originally just the Church of Rome, but now also the Church of England - had been telling them everything they needed to know in that book. Then they found out that Jesus said, \"Swear no oaths.\" Talk about an eye-opener.\n\nImagine seeing a conspiracy revealed that went back over 1000 years. Without oaths there’d have been no tenants, laboring for the nobility, and receiving mere subsistence in return. The whole society was premised on oaths; the whole society CLAIMED it was Christian, yet, it violated a very simple command of Christ! And the tradesmen had done it, too, by demanding sworn contracts of indenture for apprentices and giving their own oaths to the guilds. They had no way of knowing that was prohibited by Jesus! They were angry. \"Livid\" might be a better term. The governments had seen this coming. What could they do? Ban the book? The printing would have simply moved underground and the millennia long conspiracy would be further evidenced in that banning. They came up with a better scheme. You call it the \"Reformation.\"\n\nIn an unprecedented display of unanimity, the governments of Europe adopted a treaty. This treaty would allow anyone the State-right of founding a church. It was considered a State right, there and then. The church would be granted a charter. It only had to do one very simple thing to obtain that charter. It had to assent to the terms of the treaty.\n\nBuried in those provisions, most of which were totally innocuous, was a statement that the church would never oppose the swearing of lawful oaths. Jesus said, \"None.\" The churches all said (and still say), \"None, except . . .\" Who do you think was (is) right?\n\nThe tradesmen got even angrier! They had already left the Church of England. But with every new \"reformed\" church still opposing the clear words of Christ, there was no church for them to join - or found. They exercised the right of assembly to discuss the Bible. Some of them preached it on the street corners, using their right of freedom of speech. But they couldn’t establish a church, which followed Jesus’ words, for that would have required assent to that treaty which opposed what Jesus had commanded. To show their absolute displeasure with those who’d kept this secret for so long, they refused to give anyone in church or state any respect. It was the custom to doff one’s hat when he encountered a priest or official. They started wearing big, ugly black hats, just so that the most myopic of these claimed \"superiors\" wouldn’t miss the fact that the hat stayed atop their head. Back then the term \"you\" was formal English, reserved for use when speaking to a superior. \"Thee\" was the familiar pronoun, used among family and friends.\n\nSo they called these officials only by the familiar pronoun \"thee\" or by their Christian names, \"George, Peter, Robert, etc.\" We call these folk \"Quakers.\" That was a nickname given to them by a judge. One of them had told the judge that he’d better \"Quake before the Lord, God almighty.\" The judge, in a display of irreverent disrespect replied, \"Thee are the quaker here.\" They found that pretty funny, it being such a total misnomer (as you shall soon see), and the nickname stuck. With the huge membership losses from the Anglican Church - especially from men who’d been the more charitable to it in the past - the church was technically bankrupt. It wasn’t just the losses from the Quakers. Other people were leaving to join the new \"Reformed Churches.\" Elsewhere in Europe, the Roman Church had amassed sufficient assets to weather this storm. The far newer Anglican Church had not.\n\nBut the Anglican Church, as an agency of the State, can’t go bankrupt. It becomes the duty of the State to support it in hard times. Parliament did so. It enacted a tax to that end. A nice religious tax, and by current standards a very low tax, a tithe (10%). But it made a deadly mistake in that. The Quakers, primarily as tradesmen, recognized this income tax as a tax \"without jurisdiction,’ at least so far as they went. As men unsworn and unallieged, they pointed out that they didn’t have to pay it, nor provide a return. Absent their oaths establishing this servitude, there was \"no jurisdiction.\" And they were right. Despite laws making it a crime to willfully refuse to make a return and pay this tax, NONE were charged or arrested.\n\nThat caused the rest of the society to take notice. Other folk who’d thought the Quakers were \"extremists\" suddenly began to listen to them. As always, money talks. These guys were keeping all they earned, while the rest of the un-sworn society, thinking this tax applied to them, well; they were out 10%. The Quaker movement expanded significantly, that proof once made in the marketplace. Membership in the Anglican Church fell even further, as did charity to it. The taxes weren’t enough to offset these further losses. The tithe (income) tax was actually counterproductive to the goal of supporting the church. The members of the government and the churchmen were scared silly. If this movement continued to expand at the current rate, no one in the next generation would swear an oath.\n\nWho’d then farm the lands of the nobility? Oh, surely someone would, but not as a servant working for subsistence. The land would need to be leased under a contract, with the payment for that use established in the market, not on the unilateral whim of the nobleman. The wealth of the nobility, their incomes, was about to be greatly diminished. And the Church of England, what assets it possessed, would need to be sold-off, with what remained of that church greatly reduced in power and wealth. But far worse was the diminishment of the respect demanded by the priests and officials. They’d always held a position of superiority in the society. What would they do when all of society treated them only as equals?\n\nThey began to use the term \"anarchy.\" But England was a monarchy, not an anarchy. And that was the ultimate solution to the problem, or so those in government thought. There’s an aspect of a monarchy that Americans find somewhat incomprehensible, or at least we did two centuries ago. A crown has divine right, or at least it so claims. An expression of the divine right of a crown is the power to rule by demand. A crown can issue commands. The king says, \"jump.\" Everyone jumps.\n\nWhy do they jump? Simple. It’s a crime to NOT jump. To \"willfully fail (hey, there’s a couple of familiar terms) to obey a crown command\" is considered to be a treason, high treason. The British crown issued a Crown Command to end the tax objection movement.\n\nDid the crown order that everyone shall pay the income tax? No, that wasn’t possible. There really was \"no jurisdiction.\" And that would have done nothing to cure the lack of respect. The crown went one better. It ordered that every man shall swear an oath of allegiance to the crown! Damned Christian thing to do, eh? Literally!\n\nA small handful of the tax objectors obeyed. Most refused. It was a simple matter of black and white. Jesus said \"swear not at all.\" They opted to obey Him over the crown. That quickly brought them into court, facing the charge of high treason. An official would take the witness stand, swearing that he had no record of the defendant’s oath of allegiance. Then the defendant was called to testify, there being no right to refuse to witness against one’s self. He refused to accept the administered oath. That refusal on the record, the court instantly judged him guilty. Took all of 10 minutes. That expedience was essential, for there were another couple hundred defendants waiting to be tried that day for their own treasons against the crown. In short order the jails reached their capacity, plus. But they weren’t filled as you’d envision them. The men who’d refused the oaths weren’t there. Their children were. \n\nThere was a \"Stand-in\" law allowing for that. There was no social welfare system. The wife and children of a married man in prison existed on the charity of church and neighbors, or they ceased to exist, starving to death. It was typical for a man convicted of a petty crime to have one of his kid's stand in for him for 30 or 90 days. That way he could continue to earn a living, keeping bread on the table, without the family having to rely on charity. However, a man convicted of more heinous crimes would usually find it impossible to convince his wife to allow his children to serve his time. The family would prefer to exist on charity rather than see him back in society. But in this case the family had no option. The family was churchless. The neighbors were all in the same situation. Charity was non-existent for them. The family was destined to quick starvation unless one of the children stood- in for the breadwinner. Unfortunately, the rational choice of which child should serve the time was predicated on which child was the least productive to the family earnings.\n\nThat meant nearly the youngest, usually a daughter. Thus, the prisons of England filled with adolescent females, serving the life sentences for their dads. Those lives would be short. There was no heat in the jails. They were rife with tuberculosis and other deadly diseases. A strong man might last several years. A small girl measured her remaining time on earth in months. It was Christian holocaust, a true sacrifice of the unblemished lambs. (And, we must note, completely ignored in virtually every history text covering this era, lest the crown, government and church be duly embarrassed.)\n\nDespite the high mortality rate the jails still overflowed. There was little fear that the daughters would be raped or die at the brutality of other prisoners. The other prisoners, the real felons, had all been released to make room. Early release was premised on the severity of the crime. High treason was the highest crime. The murderers, thieves, arsonists, rapists, etc., had all been set free. That had a very profound effect on commerce. It stopped. There were highwaymen afoot on every road. Thugs and muggers ruled the city streets. The sworn subjects of the crown sat behind bolted doors, in cold, dark homes, wondering how they’d exist when the food and water ran out. They finally dared to venture out to attend meetings to address the situation. At those meetings they discussed methods to overthrow the crown to which they were sworn! Call that perjury. Call that sedition. Call it by any name, they were going to put their words into actions, and soon, or die from starvation or the blade of a thug. Here we should note that chaos (and nearly anarchy: \"no crown\") came to be, not as the result of the refusal to swear oaths, but as the direct result of the governmental demand that people swear them!\n\nThe followers of Jesus’ words didn’t bring that chaos, those who ignored that command of Christ brought it. The crown soon saw the revolutionary handwriting on the wall and ordered the release of the children and the recapture of the real felons, before the government was removed from office under force of arms. The courts came up with the odd concept of an \"affirmation in lieu of oath.\" The Quakers accepted that as a victory. Given what they’d been through, that was understandable. However, Jesus also prohibited affirmations, calling the practice an oath \"by thy head.\" Funny that He could foresee the legal concept of an affirmation 1600 years before it came to be. Quite a prophecy!\n\nWhen the colonies opened to migration, the Quakers fled Europe in droves, trying to put as much distance as they could between themselves and crowns. They had a very rational fear of a repeat of the situation. That put a lot of them here, enough that they had a very strong influence on politics. They could have blocked the ratification of the Constitution had they opposed it. Some of their demands were incorporated into it, as were some of their concessions, in balance to those demands. Their most obvious influence found in the Constitution is the definition of treason, the only crime defined in that document. Treason here is half of what can be committed under a crown. In the United States treason may only arise out of an (overt) ACTION.\n\nA refusal to perform an action at the command of the government is not a treason, hence, NOT A CRIME. You can find that restated in the Bill of Rights, where the territorial jurisdiction of the courts to try a criminal act is limited to the place wherein the crime shall have been COMMITTED. A refusal or failure is not an act \"committed\" - it’s the opposite, an act \"omitted.\" In this nation \"doing nothing\" can’t be criminal, even when someone claims the power to command you do something. That concept in place, the new government would have lasted about three years. You see, if it were not a crime to fail to do something, then the officers of that government would have done NOTHING - save to draw their pay. That truth forced the Quakers to a concession.\n\nAnyone holding a government job would need be sworn (or affirmed) to support the Constitution. That Constitution enabled the Congress to enact laws necessary and proper to control the powers vested in these people. Those laws would establish their duties. Should such an official \"fail\" to perform his lawful duties, he’d evidence in that omission that his oath was false. To swear a false oath is an ACTION. Thus, the punishments for failures would exist under the concept of perjury, not treason. But that was only regarding persons under oath of office, who were in office only by their oaths. And that’s still the situation. It’s just that the government has very cleverly obscured that fact so that the average man will pay it a rent, a tax on income. As you probably know, the first use of income tax here came well in advance of the 16th amendment. That tax was NEARLY abolished by a late 19th century Supreme Court decision. The problem was that the tax wasn’t apportioned, and couldn’t be apportioned, that because of the fact that it rested on the income of each person earning it, rather than an up-front total, divided and meted out to the several States according to the census. But the income tax wasn’t absolutely abolished. The court listed a solitary exception. The incomes of federal officers, derived as a benefit of office, could be so taxed. You could call that a \"kick back\" or even a \"return.\" Essentially, the court said that what Congress gives, it can demand back. As that wouldn’t be income derived within a State, the rule of apportionment didn’t apply. Make sense?\n\nNow, no court can just make up rulings. The function of a court is to answer the questions posed to it. And in order to pose a question, a person needs standing.\" The petitioner has to show that an action has occurred which affects him, hence, giving him that standing. For the Supreme Court to address the question of the income of officers demonstrates that the petitioner was such. Otherwise, the question couldn’t have come up.\n\nCongress was taxing his benefits of office. But Congress was ALSO taxing his outside income, that from sources within a State. Could have been interest, dividends, rent, royalties, and even alimony. If he had a side job, it might have even been commissions or salary. Those forms of income could not be taxed. However, Congress could tax his income from the benefits he derived by being an officer.\n\nThat Court decision was the end of all income taxation. The reason is pretty obvious. Rather than tax the benefits derived out of office, it’s far easier to just reduce the benefits up front! Saves time. Saves paper. The money stays in Treasury rather than going out, then coming back as much as 15 or 16 months later. So, even though the benefits of office could have been taxed, under that Court ruling, that tax was dropped by Congress. There are two ways to overcome a Supreme Court ruling. The first is to have the court reverse itself. That’s a very strange concept at law. Actually, it’s impossibility at law. The only way a court can change a prior ruling is if the statutes or the Constitution change, that changing the premises on which its prior conclusion at law was derived. Because it was a Supreme Court ruling nearly abolishing the income tax, the second method, an Amendment to the Constitution, was used to overcome the prior decision. That was the 16th Amendment.\n\nThe 16th allows for Congress to tax incomes from whatever source derived, without regard to apportionment. Whose incomes? Hey, it doesn’t say (nor do the statues enacted under it). The Supreme Court has stated that this Amendment granted Congress \"no new powers.\" That’s absolutely true. Congress always had the power to tax incomes, but only the incomes of officers and only their incomes derived out of a benefit of office. All the 16th did was extend that EXISTING POWER to tax officers’ incomes (as benefits of office) to their incomes from other sources (from whatever source derived). The 16th Amendment and the statutes enacted thereunder don’t have to say whose incomes are subject to this tax. The Supreme Court had already said that: officers. That’s logical. If it could be a crime for a freeman to \"willfully fail\" to file or pay this tax, that crime could only exist as a treason by monarchical definition. In this nation a crime of failure may only exist under the broad category of a perjury. Period, no exception.\n\nThus, the trick employed by the government is to get you to claim that you are an officer of that government. Yeah, you’re saying, \"Man, I’d never be so foolish as to claim that.\" I’ll betcha $100 I can prove that you did it and that you’ll be forced to agree. Did you ever sign a tax form, a W-4, a 1040? Then you did it.\n\nLook at the fine print at the bottom of the tax forms you once signed. You declared that it was \"true\" that you were \"under penalties of perjury.\" Are you? Were you? Perjury is a felony. To commit a perjury you have to FIRST be under oath (or affirmation). You know that. It’s common knowledge. So, to be punished for a perjury you’d need to be under oath, right? Right. There’s no other way, unless you pretend to be under oath. To pretend to be under oath is a perjury automatically. There would be no oath. Hence it’s a FALSE oath. Perjury rests on making a false oath. So, to claim to be \"under penalties of perjury\" is to claim that you’re under oath. That claim could be true, could be false. But if false, and you knowingly and willingly made that false claim, then you committed a perjury just by making that claim.\n\nYou’ve read the Constitution. How many times can you be tried and penalized for a single criminal act? Once? Did I hear you right? Did you say once; only once? Good for you. You know that you can’t even be placed in jeopardy of penalty (trial) a second time.\n\nThe term \"penalties\" is plural. More than one. Oops. Didn’t you just state that you could only be tried once, penalized once, for a single criminal action? Sure you did. And that would almost always be true. There’s a solitary exception. A federal official or employee may be twice tried, twice penalized. The second penalty, resulting out of a conviction of impeachment, is the loss of the benefits of office, for life. Federal officials are under oath, an oath of office. That’s why you call them civil servants. That oath establishes jurisdiction (oath spoken), allowing them to be penalized, twice, for a perjury (especially for a perjury of official oath). You have been tricked into signing tax forms under the perjury clause. You aren’t under oath enabling the commission of perjury. You can’t be twice penalized for a single criminal act, even for a perjury. Still, because you trusted that the government wouldn’t try to deceive you, you signed an income tax form, pretending that there was jurisdiction (oath spoken) where there was none.\n\nOnce you sign the first form, the government will forever believe that you are a civil servant. Stop signing those forms while you continue to have income and you’ll be charged with \"willful failure to file,\" a crime of doing nothing when commanded to do something!\n\nInitially, the income tax forms were required to be SWORN (or affirmed) before a notary. A criminal by the name of Sullivan brought that matter all the way to the Supreme Court. He argued that if he listed his income from criminal activities, that information would later be used against him on a criminal charge. If he didn’t list it, then swore that the form was \"true, correct and complete,\" he could be charged and convicted of a perjury. He was damned if he did, damned if he didn’t. The Supreme Court could only agree. It ruled that a person could refuse to provide any information on that form, taking individual exception to each line, and stating in that space that he refused to provide testimony against himself. That should have been the end of the income tax. In a few years everyone would have been refusing to provide answers on the \"gross\" and \"net income\" lines, forcing NO answer on the \"tax due\" line, as well. Of course, that decision was premised on the use of the notarized oath, causing the answers to have the quality of \"testimony.\"\n\nCongress then INSTANTLY ordered the forms be changed. In place of the notarized oath, the forms would contain a statement that they were made and signed \"Under penalties of perjury.\" The prior ruling of the Supreme Court was made obsolete. Congress had changed the premise on which it had reached its conclusion. The verity of the information on the form no longer rested on a notarized oath. It rested on the taxpayer’s oath of office. And, as many a tax protestor in the 1970s and early 1980s quickly discovered, the Supreme Court ruling for Sullivan had no current relevance.\n\nThere has never been a criminal trial in any matter under federal income taxation without a SIGNED tax form in evidence before the court. The court takes notice of the signature below the perjury clause and assumes the standing of the defendant is that of a federal official, a person under oath of office who may be twice penalized for a single criminal act of perjury (to his official oath). The court has jurisdiction to try such a person for a \"failure.\" That jurisdiction arises under the concept of perjury, not treason.\n\nHowever, the court is in an odd position here. If the defendant should take the witness stand, under oath or affirmation to tell the truth, and then truthfully state that he is not under oath of office and is not a federal officer or employee, that statement would contradict the signed statement on the tax form, already in evidence and made under claim of oath. That contradiction would give rise to a technical perjury. Under federal statutes, courtroom perjury is committed when a person willfully makes two statements, both under oath, which contradict one another.\n\nThe perjury clause claims the witness to be a federal person. If he truthfully says the contrary from the witness stand, the judge is then duty bound to charge him with the commission of a perjury! At his ensuing perjury trial, the two contradictory statements \"(I’m) under penalties of perjury\" and \"I’m not a federal official or employee\" would be the sole evidence of the commission of the perjury. As federal employment is a matter of public record, the truth of the last statement would be evidenced. That would prove that the perjury clause was a FALSE statement. Can’t have that proof on the record, can we? About now you are thinking of some tax protester trials for \"willful failure\" where the defendant took the witness stand and testified, in full truth, that he was not a federal person. This writer has studied a few such cases. Those of Irwin Schiff and F. Tupper Saussy come to mind. And you are right; they told the court that they weren’t federal persons. Unfortunately, they didn’t tell the court that while under oath. A most curious phenomenon occurs at \"willful failure\" trials where the defendant has published the fact, in books or newsletters, that he isn’t a federal person. The judge becomes very absent-minded - at least that’s surely what he’d try to claim if the issue were ever raised. He forgets to swear-in the defendant before he takes the witness stand. The defendant tells the truth from the witness stand, but does so without an oath. As he’s not under oath, nothing he says can constitute a technical perjury as a contradiction to the \"perjury clause\" on the tax forms already in evidence. The court will almost always judge him guilty for his failure to file. Clever system. And it all begins when a person who is NOT a federal officer or employee signs his first income tax form, FALSELY claiming that he’s under an oath which if perjured may bring him a duality of penalties. It’s still a matter of jurisdiction (oath spoken). That hasn’t changed in over 400 years. The only difference is that in this nation, we have no monarch able to command us to action. In the United States of America, you have to VOLUNTEER to establish jurisdiction. Once you do, then you are subject to commands regarding the duties of your office. Hence the income tax is \"voluntary,\" in the beginning, but \"compulsory\" once you volunteer. You volunteer when you sign your very first income tax form, probably a Form W-4 and probably at about age 15. You voluntarily sign a false statement, a false statement that claims that you are subject to jurisdiction. Gotcha! Oh, and when the prosecutor enters your prior signed income tax forms into evidence at a willful failure to file trial, he will always tell the court that those forms evidence that you knew it was your DUTY to make and file proper returns. DUTY! A free man owes no DUTY. A free man owes nothing to the federal government, as he receives nothing from it. But a federal official owes a duty. He receives something from that government - the benefits of office. In addition to a return of some of those benefits, Congress can also demand that he pay a tax on his other forms of income, now under the 16th Amendment, from whatever source they may be derived. If that were ever to be understood, the ranks of real, sworn federal officers would diminish greatly. And the ranks of the pretended federal officers (including you) would vanish to zero. It’s still the same system as it was 400 years ago, with appropriate modifications, so you don’t immediately realize it. Yes, it’s a jurisdictional matter. An Oath-spoken matter. Quite likely you, as a student of the Constitution, have puzzled over the 14th Amendment. You’ve wondered who are persons \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States and in the alternative, who are not. This is easily explained, again in the proper historical perspective.\n\nThe claimed purpose of the 14th was to vest civil rights to the former slaves. A method was needed to convert them from chattel to full civil beings. The Supreme Court had issued rulings that precluded that from occurring. Hence, an Amendment was necessary. But it took a little more than the amendment. The former slaves would need to perform an act, subjecting themselves to the \"jurisdiction\" of the United States. You should now realize that an oath is the way that was/is accomplished.\n\nAfter the battles of the rebellion had ceased, the manumitted slaves were free, but rightless. They held no electoral franchise - they couldn’t vote. The governments of the Southern States were pretty peeved over what had occurred in the prior several years, and they weren’t about to extend electoral franchises to the former slaves. The Federal government found a way to force that.\n\nIt ordered that voters had to be \"registered.\" And it ordered that to become a registered voter, one had to SWEAR an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. The white folks, by and large, weren’t about to do that. They were also peeved that the excuse for all the battles was an unwritten, alleged, Constitutional premise, that a \"State had no right to secede.\" The former slaves had no problem swearing allegiance to the Constitution. The vast majority of them didn’t have the slightest idea of what an oath was, nor did they even know what the Constitution was!\n\nGreat voter registration drives took place. In an odd historical twist, these were largely sponsored by the Quakers who volunteered their assistance. Thus, most of the oaths administered were administered by Quakers! Every former slave was sworn-in, taking what actually was an OATH OF OFFICE. The electoral franchise then existed almost exclusively among the former slaves, with the white folks in the South unanimously refusing that oath and denied their right to vote. For a while many of the Southern State governments were comprised of no one other than the former slaves. The former slaves became de jure (by oath) federal officials, \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" by that oath. They were non-compensated officials, receiving no benefits of their office, save what was then extended under the 14th Amendment. There was some brief talk of providing compensation in the form of 40 acres and a mule, but that quickly faded.\n\nJurisdiction over a person exists only by oath. Always has, always will. For a court to have jurisdiction, some one has to bring a charge or petition under an oath. In a criminal matter, the charge is forwarded under the oaths of the grand jurors (indictment) or under the oath of office of a federal officer (information). Even before a warrant may be issued, someone has to swear there is probable cause. Should it later be discovered that there was NOT probable cause, that person should be charged with a perjury. It’s all about oaths. And the one crime for which immunity, even \"sovereign immunity,\" cannot be extended is ... perjury.\n\nYou must understand \"jurisdiction.\" That term is only understandable when one understands the history behind it. Know what \"jurisdiction\" means. You didn’t WILLFULLY claim that you were \"Under penalties of perjury\" on those tax forms you signed. You may have done it voluntarily, but you surely did it ignorantly! You didn’t realize the import and implications of that clause. It was, quite frankly, a MISTAKE. A big one. A dumb one. Still it was only a mistake. Willfulness rests on intent. You had no intent to claim that you were under an oath of office, a perjury of which could bring you dual penalties. You just didn’t give those words any thought.\n\nWhat do you do when you discover you’ve made a mistake? As an honest man, you tell those who may have been affected by your error, apologize to them, and usually you promise to be more careful in the future, that as a demonstration that you, like all of us, learn by your mistakes. You really ought to drop the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States a short letter, cc it to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\nExplain that you never realized that the fine print on the bottom of all income tax forms meant that you were claiming to be \"under oath\" a perjury of which might be \"twice\" penalized. Explain that you’ve never sworn such an oath and that for reasons of conscience, you never will. You made this mistake on every tax form you’d ever signed. But now that you understand the words, you’ll most certainly not make that mistake again! That’ll be the end of any possibility that you’ll ever be charged with \"willful failure to file.\" Too simple? No, it’s only as simple as it’s supposed to be. Jurisdiction (oath spoken) is a pretty simple matter. Either you are subject to jurisdiction, by having really sworn an oath, or you are not.\n\nIf you aren’t under oath, and abolish all the pretenses, false pretenses you provided, on which the government assumed that you were under oath, then the jurisdiction fails and you become a freeman. A freeman can’t be compelled to perform any act and threatened with a penalty, certainly not two penalties, should he fail to do so. That would constitute a treason charge by the part of the definition abolished here.\n\nIt’s a matter of history. European history, American history, and finally, the history of your life. The first two may be hidden from you, making parts of them difficult to discover. But the last history you know. If you know that you’ve never sworn an oath of office, and now understand how that truth fits the other histories, then you are free. Truth does that. Funny how that works.\n\nJesus was that Truth. His command that His followers \"Swear not at all.\" That was the method by which He set men free. Israel was a feudal society. It had a crown; it had landlords; they had tenant farmers bound by oath to them. Jesus scared them silly. Who’d farm those lands in the next generation, when all of the people refused to swear oaths? Ring a bell? And what did the government do to Jesus? It tried to obtain jurisdiction on the false oath of a witness, charging Him with \"sedition\" for the out-of-context, allegorical statement that He’d \"tear down the temple\" (a government building). At that trial, Jesus stood mute, refusing the administered oath. That was unheard of!\n\nThe judge became so frustrated that he posed a trick question attempting to obtain jurisdiction from Jesus. He said, \"I adjure you in the name of the Living God, are you the man (accused of sedition).\" An adjuration is a \"compelled oath.\" Jesus then broke his silence, responding, \"You have so said.\"\n\nHe didn’t \"take\" the adjured oath. He left it with its speaker, the judge! That bound the judge to truth. Had the judge also falsely said that Jesus was the man (guilty of sedition)? No, not out loud, not yet. But in his heart he’d said so. That’s what this trial was all about. Jesus tossed that falsehood back where it belonged as well as the oath. In those few words, \"You have so said,\" Jesus put the oath, and the PERJURY of it, back on the judge, where it belonged. The court couldn’t get jurisdiction.\n\nIsrael was occupied by Rome at that time. The court then shipped Jesus off to the martial governor, Pontius Pilate, hoping that martial power might compel him to submit to jurisdiction. But Pilate had no quarrel with Jesus. He correctly saw the charge as a political matter, devoid of any real criminal act. Likely, Pilate offered Jesus the \"protection of Rome.\" Roman law extended only to sworn subjects. All Jesus would need do is swear an oath to Caesar, then Pilate could protect him. Otherwise, Jesus was probably going to turn up dead at the hands of \"person or persons unknown\" which would really be at the hands of the civil government, under the false charge of sedition. Pilate administered that oath to Caesar. Jesus stood mute, again refusing jurisdiction. Pilate \"marveled at that.\" He’d never before met a man who preferred to live free or die. Under Roman law the unsworn were considered to be unclean - the \"great unwashed masses.\" The elite were sworn to Caesar.\n\nWhen an official errantly extended the law to an unsworn person that \"failure of jurisdiction\" required that the official perform a symbolic act. To cleanse himself and the law, he would \"wash his hands.\" Pilate did so. Under Roman law, the law to which he was sworn, he had to do so. The law, neither Roman law nor the law of Israel, could obtain jurisdiction over Jesus. The law couldn’t kill Him, nor could it prevent that murder. Jesus was turned over to a mob, demanding His death. How’s that for chaos? Jesus was put to death because He refused to be sworn. But the law couldn’t do that. Only a mob could do so, setting free a true felon in the process. Thus, Jesus proved the one failing of the law - at least the law then and there - the law has no ability to touch a truly free man. A mob can, but the result of that is chaos, not order.\n\nIn every situation where a government attempts to compel an oath, or fails to protect a man of conscience who refuses it, the result is chaos. That government proves itself incapable of any claimed powers as the result, for the only purpose of any government should be to defend the people establishing it - all of those people - and not because they owe that government any duty or allegiance, but for the opposite reason, because the government owes the people its duty and allegiance under the law. This nation came close to that concept for quite a few decades. Then those in federal office realized that they could fool all of the people, some of the time. That \"some of the time\" regarded oaths and jurisdiction. We were (and still are) a Christian nation, at least the vast majority of us claim ourselves to be Christian. But we are led by churchmen who still uphold the terms of that European treaty. They still profess that it is Christian to swear an oath, so long as it’s a \"lawful oath.\" We are deceived. As deceived as the tenant in 1300, but more so, for we now have the Words of Jesus to read for ourselves.\n\nJesus said, \"Swear no oaths,\" extending that even to oaths which don’t name God. If His followers obeyed that command, the unscrupulous members of the society in that day would have quickly realized that they could file false lawsuits against Jesus’ followers, suits that they couldn’t answer (under oath). Thus, Jesus issued a secondary command, ordering His followers to sell all they had, making themselves what today we call \"judgement proof.\" They owned only their shirt and a coat. If they were sued for their shirt, they were to offer to settle out-of-court (without oath) by giving the plaintiff their coat. That wasn’t a metaphor. Jesus meant those words in the literal sense!\n\nIt’s rather interesting that most income tax protestors are Christian and have already made themselves virtually judgement proof, perhaps inadvertently obeying one of Jesus’ commands out of a self-preservation instinct. Do we sense something here? You need to take the final step. You must swear no oaths. That is the penultimate step in self-preservation, and in obedience to the commands of Christ. It’s all a matter of \"jurisdiction\" (oath spoken), which a Christian can’t abide. Christians must be freemen. Their faith, duty and allegiance can go to no one on earth. We can’t serve two masters. No one can. As Christians our faith and allegiance rests not on an oath. Our faith and allegiance arise naturally. These are duties owed by a child to his father. As Children of God, we must be faithful to Him, our Father, and to our eldest Brother, the Inheritor of the estate. That’s certain.\n\nAs to what sort of a society Jesus intended without oaths or even affirmations, this writer honestly can’t envision. Certainly it would have been anarchy (no crown). Would it have also been chaos? My initial instinct is to find that it would lead to chaos. Like the Quakers in 1786, I can’t envision a functional government without the use of oaths. Yet, every time a government attempts to use oaths as a device to compel servitudes, the result is CHAOS. History proves that. The Dark Ages were dark, only because the society was feudal, failing to advance to enlightenment because they were sworn into servitudes, unwittingly violating Jesus’ command. When the British crown attempted to compel oaths of allegiance, chaos certainly resulted. And Jesus’ own death occurred only out of the chaos derived by His refusal to swear a compelled oath and an offered oath.\n\nThe current Internal Revenue Code is about as close to legislated chaos as could ever be envisioned. No two people beginning with identical premises will reach the same conclusion under the IRC. Is not that chaos? Thus, in every instance where the government attempts to use oaths to bind a people, the result has been chaos.\n\nHence, this writer is forced to the conclusion that Jesus was right. We ought to avoid oaths at all costs, save our own souls, and for precisely that reason. Yet, what system of societal interaction Jesus envisioned, without oaths, escapes me. How would we deal with murderers, thieves, rapists, etc. present in the society without someone bringing a complaint, sworn complaint, before a Jury (a panel of sworn men), to punish them for these criminal actions against the civil members of that society? Perhaps you, the reader, can envision what Jesus had in mind. Even if you can’t, you still have to obey His command. That will set you free. As to where we go from there, well, given that there has never been a society, neither civil nor martial, which functioned without oaths, I guess we won’t see how it will function until it arrives.\n\nMeanwhile, the first step in the process is abolishing your prior FALSE claims of being under oath (of office) on those income tax forms. You claimed \"jurisdiction.\" Only you can reverse that by stating the Truth. It worked 400 years ago. It’ll still work. It’s the only thing that’ll work. History can repeat, but this time without the penalty of treason extended to you (or your daughters). You can cause it. Know and tell this Truth and it will set you free. HONESTLY. Tell the government, then explain it to every Christian you know. Most of them will hate you for that bit of honesty. Be kind to them anyhow. \n\nOnce they see that you are keeping what you earn, the market will force them to realize that you aren’t the extremist they originally thought! If only 2% of the American people understand what is written here, income taxation will be abolished - that out of a fear that the knowledge will expand. The government will be scared silly. What if no one in the next generation would swear an oath? Then there’d be no servants! No, the income tax will be abolished long before that could ever happen. That’s only money.\n\nPower comes by having an ignorant people to rule. A government will always opt for power. That way, in two or three generations, the knowledge lost to the obscure \"between the lines\" of history, they can run the same money game. Pass this essay on to your Christian friends. But save a copy. Will it to your grandchildren. Someday, they too will probably need this knowledge. Teach your children well. Be honest; tell the truth. That will set you free - and it’ll scare the government silly.

There is somebody they purport to be “MR. CLIFFORD” , and as I read these TRANSCRIPTS I realize that this is not Dean.  There is somebody “acting as Dean”.  Dean does not talk like this.  I know Dean.  He does not trip over his words.\n\nThe Dean I know is very precise in his speech and concise in his phrasing.  That said, the PUBLIC RECORD is replete with Dean Clifford “quotations”.  He appears to be “RESPONDING” to the “TITLE”, “MR. CLIFFORD” while simultaneously denying his status as “MR. CLIFFORD”.\n\nThe words and phrasing that he is using have an air of familiarity to them, like I've read them before...like, you know, in other court transcripts.  \n\nThey took $60.00 from Martin, but did not deliver him a signed copy.  Even though they charged him a bargain price, he still bought an AUTHENTICATED DOCUMENT.  Martin is aware of the contents now, but he most certainly did not receive what he purchased.  \n\nAnybody who has followed my adventures getting transcripts knows beyond any doubt that this is not the way a COURT REPORTER'S OFFICE works in real life.  \n\nWHY did they produce this so fast, and WHY does it so conveniently have Dean answering to “MR CLIFFORD”, when questions are asked?...\n\nSeriously?  Does anybody buy that?\n\nDean is an AQUILAE TRUSTEE.  HE UNDERSTANDS OATHS, FEALTY AND SURETY.  In sort, Dean knows better.  He actually has a clue, and he has experience.\n\nAll of you are a bunch of morons who can't tell their asses from a hole-in-the-ground, and YOU know better!  \n\nThey're trying to convince me that Dean has BREACHED THE TRUST.  I can either RESPOND TO THEM, now that I have KNOWLEDGE of this “TRANSCRIPT” or...\n\nI can take the high road, and let you read through it; and you tell me if you think you are hearing Dean, or if this is just cut-and-paste from other hearings.  Special bonus points for those who can tell me why this is most definitely NOT a COURT TRANSCRIPT! http://mail.cdd.com/Clifford-%20Dean-13FEB15.pdf mail.cdd.com "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_708085175894084","body":"God bless America? and Fuck Pride *RIP George Carlin* youtu.be I recommend you to watch Bill hicks too niggas :P he is awesome as george and NETWORK too a good movie wallstreet got what they want, they took the retiremen...

I promise to answer an equal or greater number of prayers than your current Jesus.\n\nI hope those who are about to be purged will enjoy not reading these fabulous literary masterpieces, or any other gold in the comments.  For everyone else not wishing to be purged, make a post here, and justify your existence.\n\nIt should be noted that those who are members of our Battlefield 2142 resurrected group enjoy special immunity from all of these purging policies, as this places you at a level of \"coolness\" which makes these purges beneath you.  Plus, we get to metaphorically \"shoot you in the head\".  \n\nThis purge will take place over the next 10 days as I am blessed with extra staff, all of whom need the serious stress relief that booting members seems to provide.\n\nIs everyone seated comfortably?..LET THE PURGE BEGIN!\n\nhttp://youtu.be/EO1061QisVs "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_518715888164348","body":"THE TENDER FOR LAW PRESENTS: ALL THE SHIT THAT DEAN KORY IS DOING WRONG!\n\n...AND NAZIS!\n\nOk, that's a bit of an overly dramatic title, in as much as the courts don't actually follow their own rules any more.  \n\nStill though... You still get Nazis, so there's that.\n\nJust because they don't feel like following the rules, doesn't mean we have to be “scumbags” like them.  I listened to all the audio recordings that Dean Kory made of his hearings (time I'll never get back, so you fucking owe me, dude!), and I feel it's important for me to correct a few key points here.\n\nI know all of you get your information from multiple sources, ranging from the Grand-Poobah of the Free-Dumb Movement, Robert Menard, to Dean Clifford, to Winston Strout; and maybe it's just self-aggrandizement, but I like to think I'm the only source that tells you the truth instead of just orbiting it.  As with many things in life there's “more than one way to skin a cat”.  However, one of the worst things you can do is “mix methods”.\n\nDean Clifford and I are at exact opposite ends of the scale.  Dean's name is Trust property, thus giving the man that you know as Dean Clifford a great number of options the rest of you don't have.  He doesn't use the Trust like a bank machine, he doesn't abuse any of the authority that any Trust title gives him, and he has the personal knowledge that he's not on his own if he has to “get the fuck out of Dodge”.  That's where the consensus ends amoung us.  \n\nDean's teachings on Trust Law are accurate, concise and accessible.  For some reason it's worth it for him to give everything he teaches those qualities.  \n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI'm not a super-genius, and I don't possess any mental powers that you don't.  Any discussion and/or engagement with me starts off with the reality that you ALL THINK WRONG, and YOU ALL VALUE THE WRONG THINGS!  This does not serve you when you are up against reality.\n\nThe sad part is that most of you are too old to change; and as I've demonstrated here in this little forum,   none of you can tell the difference between what's true and what feels good.  I know what you're experiencing.  Whether from Dean, or from myself, the time always comes when you read something that one of us writes and you KNOW that it is true; but you take no further time to understand what is being told to you.\n\nFortunately Dean Kory has provided us a working/living example of what happens when all of the above factors are in play.\n\nThe first obvious mistake that Dean Kory is making is that he is combining what Dean Clifford teaches with what I teach.  For the purposes of this article I'm going to dumb the two positions down so you can make the comparison.\n\nDean Clifford is all about being left alone, and when he's not left alone, he is about calling “them” to account.  \n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI am descended from the very people that put all of this in place.  Entire stereotypes about Scottish people exist to misdirect.  Most will tell you that Scotsmen are “cheap”, when in reality we are conservative about when we engage in commerce.  You have but to look at England's and Scotland's history to see why this is true.  \n\nThe very name of this group, THE TENDER FOR LAW, is all about that mysterious phrase, “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER”.  \n\nI'll be the first to admit there are a great number of benefits to be enjoyed in commerce, when everybody plays by the rules.  As I'm sure everyone is sadly aware of, by now; Nobody is playing by the rules anymore. \n\nTrying to “fix the system”, or call them to account in their own system, is simply “appealing to your rapist”.  It baffles me that anyone would think this is sound thinking.\n\n...I digress.\n\nAs I'm in a unique position to “follow the money”, I can determine who needs to pay the price for the royal screw-over we've been given.  As I type this, a team of system's engineers (and trained monkeys) are preparing for you, the reader, a step-by-step guide for cleaning out every financial institution that touches these shores.  The only price that I ask for this knowledge is that you pass it on to others.  Pay it forward...and get paid at the same time.  Who else offers that shit?\n\nI am many things.  I am prorogued Nobility.  I am a published author.  I am a composer.  Above all...the thing that forms the core of who and what I am, is that I am a computer scientist.  Those who have taken the time to actually listen to me, will recognize many “Scott-isms”; and the phrase “COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING” is repeated almost as often as my Number 1 “Scott-ism”, “THE MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG.”  You ignore these two truths at your own peril. \n\n...and reality does not care what you “believe”.\n\nThis lengthy preamble is to drive the next point home.  \n\nDO NOT TRY TO COMBINE DEAN'S METHODS WITH MINE.\n\nThere is no remedy in fraud.  There simply isn't.\n\nIn many ways I long for the old days where those who breached the PUBLIC TRUST were hauled into the street and thrown into an angry mob.  Authors have mistakenly used the term, “Hanging Judge”  as a term for a judge imposing strict penalties; but if you look through actual history, and not the crap you were taught in the Public Fool System, “Hanging Judge” refers to a judge who has abused his power and has been hung for the abuse of that trust. He gives sentences he should be hung for; HANGING JUDGE. You never hear the phrase “hanging JUSTICE” ;) This is odd, as there are so many of them. :D  ...I know. Digressing. I get it.\n\nWe don't have Judges any more, in Canada.  A judge traditionally was a trusted individual who could uphold the PUBLIC TRUST.  “We the people” no longer get to decide who is worthy of that trust.  People confuse the role of “judge” with the current role of “JUSTICE”.  It is important to know the distinction.\n\nJUSTICE is actually a “doing-business-as” name for a Crown Corporation.  It actually says, in the Dunn and Bradstreet listings “Government of Ontario Operating as JUSTICE”.  It has been like that, IN VARIOUS FORMS, since 1982.\n.\n..I'm sorry you missed it.\n\nThat is what you're dealing with, and you have ONE unalienable RIGHT; THE RIGHT NOT TO CONTRACT.  \n\nMy position is a lot closer to that held by Irene Gravenhorst, than it is to Dean Clifford's.\n\nSo, let's cover what Dean Kory is doing wrong! :D\n\nI notice a lot of “Clifford-isms” in what Dean Kory is clearly attempting to say; but all of Dean Clifford's methods depend on what I like to refer to as “Clubhouse Rules”, and every time you do this you're pretending to “be in the club”.  The natural response to somebody doing this is very similar to the response to somebody saying they know more than I.  In case you haven't noticed I smack them down in the most humiliatingly, and public way possible.  “Their” reaction is going to be much the same...we're all human after all.\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE (like the cheese) stands alone.\n\nIt is the only issue you should be concerned about! NOTHING ELSE!\n\nSERIOUSLY! Accepting discussion about anything else, is a FUCKING NEGOTIATION.  All of you are not seeing the forest through the trees.  This is why I say Dean Clifford's position is flawed.  He believes the tree can be pruned to look pretty again, when in reality it needs it's roots burned out, and it's limbs chopped up for one of Sir-Mica's gassifiers! The fucking tree is dead!\n\nUNDERSTAND?\n\nThe tree is dead!  \n\nIt's filled with parasites and rot, and the parasites are trying to keep the illusion of a tree standing.  For the past two years I have been feeding them the rope, at my own expense, and with violence inflicted upon me, so that any argument contrary to my position is immediately nullified.  IT IS/WILL BE, CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE that you are NOT getting what you are entitled to, given the burden of surety you have carried!\n\nUnlike THE MAJORITY of your “sources of truth”:\n\nI'm not one of these people that wants to drive without a licence.  \nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their mortgage.  \nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their taxes.  \nI DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE I FUCKING PROMISED TO!\nI am, however, someone that possesses knowledge and skills that the government finds/found essential to their expansion.  In my youth I gave our erstwhile government a tool, which all of you pay the price for today; and I was rewarded handsomely.  I patted myself on the back, and strutted around, knowing that I was smarter than everyone else, and never once paying attention to the harm I had caused.\n\nIn compliance with an oath I took a long time ago, I must atone for that; and that's the only reason you, the reader, even know that I exist.  \n\nI need to remind you again, that the only reason I'm here, is that I promised to be.\n\nNone of you have value to me.  You're not qualified to.\n\nI have a lot to teach you, and we are barely getting started; but I am not responsible for the shit that goes wrong when you try to take what I teach you (“REALITY”) and you try to jam it into your idiotic, unqualified, belief structure.  As I write that sentence I wonder how many of you have actually pondered that other “Scott-ism” you frequently hear; “ALL BELIEF IS EVIL.”  If you believe something, you will stop questioning it; you will stop investigating it, and you will never ponder if, and why, it's true.\n\nShould you believe something, that just happens to be true, you won't look any further – and that's a problem.  \n\nSo I want everyone to keep the following in mind.  All the sources you are investigating tell the truth about the law, but there are pitfalls!\n\nEverything Robert Menard says about the law is true.  It's what he doesn't say that's the lie.  If you want quick confirmation of this simply ask him what, “This note is legal tender” means.  If he tells you the truth (he won't), ask him why he's constantly “begging” for that very same TENDER FOR LAW that contains the ACTS and STATUTES that he claims don't apply to him! THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER is a TENDER FOR LAW. If you BENEFIT, then you have OBLIGATION!\n  \nEverything Dean Clifford says about the law is true, but how he chooses to apply it, is not; because there's still a lot of “belief” running around in his head.  He still believes he can “beat them at their own game.”  He will proudly point out their public and blatant violations... His evidence is irrefutable and conclusive. His rights are violated by those TRUSTEES of the PUBLIC, and then he tries to seek remedy from those same trustees! REALLY? \n\n...and then says the remedy, is to go to those very same people and “sue” them..in the very same courts that violated his rights. (What?)  ...Oh that's right, those are DIFFERENT courts, with DIFFERENT\n “Doing business as” JUSTICES. (WHAT?)  ...well, I'll just let you work out the flaw from there. If you can't, then you are too stupid to be reading this, and you should kill yourself.\n\nFeel free to try it this way. It's NOT “wrong”, but it ignores the fact that those who hold the PUBLIC TRUST, ARE wrong. Another “Scott-ism” is my position that NONE OF YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT FEELS GOOD! Following Dean Clifford's methods WILL drive this point home, so it's not a COMPLETE waste. ;)\n\nWell then...back to Dean Kory.\n\nRumour has it, through the grape vine, that the erstwhile Mr. Kory has been and/or will be, a guest on Global C.R.A.P. Radio, hosted by the redoubtable Tony “guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth” Butros.  This promises to be an exciting show, and I cannot wait to miss it.  I eagerly anticipate the thrill of not consuming time I'll never get back.  \n\nInstead I'll put something useful here – advice for your next court room appearance, Mr. Kory.\n\nWhen you're in the court room dealing with these babbling, sacks-of-shit, learn to use the breaks.  Repeat after me, “I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS”.  If they ignore your question, then your next response should be, “OBJECTION.  If the court cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.”  Keep repeating that, and repeating that, and repeating that...until they answer your fucking question.  \n\nI listen to you in court, Dean Kory, and I picture a girl screaming rape while slipping the condom on the rapist.  I notice the distinct lack of that phrase in ANY of your recordings, so repeat it in your head, “Objection.  If you cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.”\n\nApply THE TENDER FOR LAW Rule to this.  I choose my words very, very carefully, because I know what they mean.  You, the reader, seem to believe there's a library in your ass, because that's demonstrably where you keep pulling your answer out of.  If you see me using a phrase that should be used in court, the very first thing you should do is follow my rules.  Look up every single word, even, no scratch that, ESPECIALLY, if you THINK you know what the word means.  As the regular reader for THE TENDER FOR LAW will tell you, you most certainly don't.\n\nDean Kory reserves his rights, and then doesn't know what the fuck to do with them; but that's ok, because there are plenty of other people in the court room that know what to do with Dean Kory's rights.  \n\nOne thing Dean Kory should learn is that he is most certainly not Dean Clifford.  Make no mistake, it doesn't matter if I disagree with Dean Clifford's methods.  The fact is, I understand them.  What Dean Clifford is doing is beyond your current level of comprehension.  He is not joking when he says that everything he says and does, is part of a larger plan.  I disagree with Dean Clifford's position and methods, because he pays too high a price for the sake of worthless people; but he's doing it for all of you, and not just for himself.  I will admit statistically, this does skew the numbers in his favour; because in the end, Dean Clifford is like you.  You all think wrong, and value the wrong things.\n\nThe only difference between you and Dean Clifford is that some of the things he values ARE the right things.  \n\nWe are all doing this for different reasons.  \n\nRobert Menard will try to scam you out of every cent you have by telling you the truth...because he thinks you deserve it.  You're the Mafia wife, the enabler, and he rationalizes that he's not taking anything of any value from you.  \n\nDean Clifford sees that you're all asleep, and he values mankind as a whole; but like Mary Croft before him, he's beginning to realize that everyone prefers “lucid dreaming” to actually being awake.  The time he takes pandering to that crowd robs him of time, and returns nothing.  \n\nMy position is blatantly self-centered.  I was born with a title I didn't choose.  I was sold to the government, and warehoused for McMaster University because it turned out I was smarter than everybody...and apparently that's a crime.  When I began to call all parties to account, they spared themselves by making certain promises and offering certain concessions and entitlements, which they no longer honour.  \n\nMy aim is to misbehave.\n\nLike Robert Menard, I want you to suffer for your ignorance, especially if you've come to me before.  I want to wield what I know against those who would dare seek to harm me and those that I care about; because all of you are walking a path now, and none of you realize it's a one-way trip.  You all want your freedom, and my position is, “Be careful what you wish for.”  \n\nAs you all think wrong, and value the wrong things, so it is unlikely you could possibly know what to do with freedom.  If you find yourself making that one-way trip, through that hole in the fence, remember that on the other side, are people just like me.\n\nAll of you are welcomed to believe whatever makes you feel good.  Martin Sutton's belief, for instance, makes him feel good, and he identifies it as the core of who he is; and all I can think is, “This is what happens when evil has consumed an extraordinary man.”\n\nALL belief is evil.  Martin Sutton is incapable of evil, so the belief sits there like a parasite, taking this man's good qualities and giving them to “Jesus”.  \n\nAt this point I can classify Martin Sutton as belief's “best-case-scenario”.  \n\nBelief is taking not thinking and making a virtue out of it.  \n\nAll of the people from whom you seek knowledge are extraordinary in their own way.  However, reality doesn't care about these things.  \n\nI certainly hope this effort gets Mr. Kory focused on what's important, but the reality is, all of this is a symptom of a much larger problem.\n\nWe're all running out of time.  I don't know if anyone has noticed the professional name-callers have been labeling people who point out the truth as “conspiracy theorists”, while at the same time publishing the inane babbling of actual conspiracy theorists.  This method is much like Americans putting people who hire hookers on sex-offender registries, thus removing any distinction between a guy who indulges in a rent-a-fuck-toy experience, and the Scarborough rapist.  Because none of you understand the exponential function, you couldn't see the bell-curve of your rights being whittled away.\n\nBefore I end this article, let's take a little walk through Canadian legal history.\n\nAt this point in legal history, the Criminal Code pretends to be the Common Law remedy, bestowed to an administrative zone of a sole proprietor CORPORATION called Canada...but this wasn't always the case.\n\nI'm going to presume that you don't have knowledge of the Canadian Bill of Rights.  I freely admit this is not a reasonable presumption as Dean Clifford never shuts up about it (I swear that guy jerks off reading it).  \n\nOne of the most protected rights in that bill of rights was Freedom of Speech.  Under the Bill of Rights “offences” like hate speech, blasphemous libel (yes, that's a criminal code offence – look it up), and “uttering a death threat”, would not be possible.  \n\nThe UK Canada Act 1982, better known as “The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms”,  includes a “notwithstanding” clause.  This gives the elected representatives of an administrative zone's constituency the power and authority to say, “Fuck off, that's just stupid,” to any Federal Statute.  The closest a province has ever come to using this was on the “gay marriage” issue.  Everyone's entire government had just been privatized, and their biggest concern appeared to be whether two dudes can marry.  \n\nI look at events like this and sometimes I can't help but think, “Maybe Menard's right.  Maybe you do deserve it.”  \n\nAnyway, while you were all in a tizzy about whether a dude can wear a wedding dress and be taken seriously, other more sinister machinations were afoot.  \n\nHis name is Ernst Zündel of Regina v. Zündel fame, and his story went something like this:\n\nErnst Zündel is one of those ideological pustules on society that invariably erupt when free speech is so vigorously protected.  I've read what Mr. Zündel has to say, and he cites reliable sources to support his position.  This ignores the reality, and other evidence, that counters his position.  \n\nWhat's more reasonable to accept?\n\nThat the holocaust didn't happen?  Or that Roma (gypsies), the mentally ill, the handicapped, the Muslims, the Jews, the homosexuals, and the political dissidents, were all rounded up and exterminated; and the Jews just whined about it the most.  People doing stupid things at “crime scenes” don't help, and support idiots like Mr. Zündel.  With only a little, tiny bit of probing, you will discover this fun fact regarding the holocaust.  Those smoke-stacks on Auschwitz  were built in 1947 for “dramatic effect”; and when pressured on it, every holocaust memorial foundation grudgingly admits this is true.\n\nBut back to Mr. Zündel....\n\nErnst Zündel was doing the Streisand effect, before Barbara Streisand made it cool. \n\nAfter the constitution was ratified, parliament quickly set about whittling away your free speech rights, and Ernst Zündel happened to be in the right place at the right time.  No one knew it then.\n\nNow Ernst Zündel is a hateful little man; and he wants the world to know it.  So much so, he decided you could avail yourself of his opinion by calling up his “976 Hate Speech Hotline”...for the low, low charge of ten dollars appearing on your phone bill, you could injest all the hate-mongering that would fit on an answering machine tape (Yes, a fucking tape.  That's how long ago this shit happened).  \n\nPeople called up and he actually profited from being a hateful little man...and if the story ended there, you could reasonably think, “Fuck this is Canada.  You can do anything”, and we'd all live happily ever after.  \n\nAfter a couple of months of profiting from people with more money than brains, rumour of this great scam eventually fell on the ears of a Jew.  See?  Mel Gibson was right.  Jews are always causing trouble.  Well it came to pass, that this great scam did fall on the ear of a Jew, and attached to that ear of a Jew, was a Jew with a finger, which could dial a telephone; and for the bargain price of ten bucks...he could make history!\n\nI freely admit that I wouldn't pass that shit up, so there's no way a Jew's going to.  Remember the stereotypes kids, and be advised that Jews come to Scottish people to learn humility.\n\nDo you guys see how many stereotypes I've managed to jam into here so far?\n\nAs the result of this hilarious chain of events, Mr. Zündel became the dubious winner of the “First Man to be Charged with Hate Speech” prize.  Under this “code” Mr. Zündel's position was indefensible, but he had an “ace up his sleeve”.  He had studied the constitution and believed he had the right to do what he did.   His lawyer, probably another Jew, saw dollar signs rocketing all the way to the Supreme Court, so he grabbed onto the Law Society's tit and sucked as hard as he could.  This case plodded through the courts relentlessly, and ended up at the Supreme Court where they freely admitted that all hate speech laws are, by their very nature, unconstitutional.  However, Nazis are “bad” so they decided to remove that right and blatantly ignore anything the constitution has to say, with an addendum pointing out that each administrative zone (province) has the right to exercise that “notwithstanding” clause nobody's ever dared use.  \n\nThey'll save it for something important...like dudes getting married to each other.  I say dudes because I refuse to accept the proposition that hot girl-on-girl action is NOT a human right.\n\nThese events marked the beginning of the slippery slope of rights removal all of you are just discovering now.  It has been happening for a very long time.  \n\nMuch has happened since the Zündel case.  The public is slowly spoon-fed ridiculous concepts.  The United States slipped even faster using our “enlightened” hate-speech laws as an example.  Now there is a perfectly “legal” “War on Terror”.  Americans are so stupid that they don't even realise they're making war on something that's not even an noun.  “War on Drugs” at least meets the “noun” criterion.  If you had to defend the “War on Drugs”, it's only defense would be, “At least we're making war on a noun.”\n\nI'll let that sink in.\n\nHow many stupid “Patriotic Americans” don't realize there's a war on something that's not even a fucking noun.  If I think you don't deserve to live for not realizing that, imagine how low you rank in the eyes of those who created this policy – all \"perfectly legal\".\n\nWe need a Monarch dictator for a generation, to bitch-slap you back to reality.  For, one of the other things that I don't hide, is the fact that I, and other privateers, commissioned the AQUILAE TRUST with the primary mandate: To assist in the restoration of executive power of the Monarchy, under the terms of the AQUILAE COVENANT.\n\nThree generations ago, Princess Elizabeth called to the then recently-released slaves, to help her stop the Empire from being wiped-out by the Germans.  And she is of German descent.  That war left a legacy that is priceless.  It formed the corner stone of civilization and brought us into a new Golden Age.  \n\nThe laws of commerce work when everybody plays by the rules, and when everybody's rights are respected.  For three decades I have screamed that this is not happening.  \n\nSo I have set out to prove it to you.  My goal is to show you all that there is no deception.  They're just not playing by the rules any more.  The people responsible for your chronic ignorance, jumped ship long ago.  Now we're stuck with parrots and chimps, running a mighty, but decaying, infrastructure.\n\nJust remember this is on an exponential curve too.\n\nI am doing my utmost to construct a lifeboat, and to detach you from all this.  What I am constructing (to paraphrase Q from Star Trek) has wonders to satiate all desires, both subtle and gross.  But it's not for the timid.  \n\nHere is my court room position in a nutshell.  \n\nYou do not accept surety – EVER.  \n\nStep 1: Reserve all rights.  (get Derek Moran to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\n\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed.  Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS.  If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. \n\nAnything outside of this supports their position that you are “playing” their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules.  The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.\n\nThink very carefully about this.  If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\n and its rules, you might raise the obvious question, “Why do you get to move two pieces?”  If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to “understand” that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game.  You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert.  \n\nNovice drivers and expert drivers all have to follow the same rules.  You don't get to ignore rules because you suck at them.  Just as my chess board is not a chess school, the court will not allow the presumption that you being a novice is a lawful excuse.  The only method to extract yourself “with honour” is to accept responsibility for the mistake in presumption.  They are presuming something wrong...and you are acknowledging it's your fault.  The court must accept this MISTAKE, and your entreaty for forgiveness for the unintended debt created.  The court MUST do this.  \n\nYour name should never come into it.  Your name is but a piece of evidence in a much larger presumption that the court has the right to attach a name derived from a public document, to a living man.  This, of course, is untrue.  The court knows it's not their right.  That's why in the Mary Croft days, the quote “living man” argument worked.  But these are trimming at the branches of the poisonous tree in an attempt to make it look pretty.  The only solution is to target the root.  The root is accounting and surety; there's no farther to dig down.\n\nYou have all heard the quote, “I am not a number.  I am a free man.”  This came from the profoundly subversive British television series, The Prisoner, which exposes the Noble Lie in the most blunt and obvious way possible, without using the actual words.  If you take the time and watch this series, you can see very clearly, knowing what you know so far, exactly how everything is.  The protagonist, played by Patrick McGoohan, who truly supports the concept that acting is an art form, is only ever identified as “Number 6”.  The highest ranking officer in the prison is only “Number 2”, whose character keeps changing; none of them ever answering the constantly-posed question, “Who is 'Number ONE'?”  \n\nAnd...because I fucking-love giving away the ending...\n\n“Number ONE” turns out to be a delusion of the protagonist's own making, whom others around him exploited; all to answer the question, “Why did you resign?”  I want you to think about that as you go down this path.  \n\nYou will be pursued by the people you once served, and you will be asked, “Why did you resign?”  To answer is to become “salvage”.  You never learned why “Number 6” “resigned”, because his position is what your position should be as regards government.\n\nNONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS!  \n\nIf you want to be even more hostile reach for a “Scott-ism”, FOR WHATEVER REASON OFFENDS YOU THE MOST!\n\nSo there's your homework.  Read this article over, and over, and over again.  Just so there's no confusion, I am communicating on several levels here.  Whoever is reading this, pay close attention to what I say.\n\nThat's it.

I have a lot to say about him, I was in Sweden when he actually asked to call me all the way from his expensive little penthouse in Toronto to sniff me out, let me digress and say that I guess because I am trustworthy, people tend to confide spontaneously, I don t ask questions, I find it rude....anyways, before this Scott flipped out on me 2 days later, the first phone call he called overseas at his own expense, we must have talked 40 mn, then he asked me to get skype ( I did and uninstalled it after the blow out and incidentally it had scrambled the PC I was in so bad I had to let a friend remote fix from the US, and even for her using logmein, and her expertise as an ex US force repair tech for PC circuitry outer space in orbit for their special satellites....she is retired, in the process she just about got her PC all fucked up too, the creep must have done soemthing, he is a PC programmer or something in those lines, besides his legal shit. Anyways, what I found out about him, is for one he is hiding behind a shady trust calles aquilae trust, in it was then Dean Clifford and Andrew Langevin, I saw andrew enter the penthouse on day two, on skype....the other thing is he told me they had 10K in the trust to take down Robert Menard....then that his goal is to re-instate the trust of the Monarchy, when I asked which Monarchy, he said Elizabeth, and went on on how of a hottie she used to be and how she upholds the Common Law, ok well technically I guess, but then he got on my case, giving me shit for all the notices I sent, I sent only 2, one to the receiver general saying I was voiding all my contracts, sin, citizenship and all, and why....( that part for a later conversation, or go to my about page and you will eventually find it ) the other was a 10 day notice, about me giving allegience to God, I dropped that one on the shores of the NSA, on a public board they admiister. Well Scott started flipping on me about God, and how tired he is of all these people with uimaginary friends etc, and when I started taking his argument down, he outright started calling me a cunt and screaming I just said goodbye and hang up on him. I knew them I was onto something, who the hell would call Sweden for 40 mn other than a high level rat. So I blocked him on FB, I blocked Andrew and Dean as well, Mika has kept Andrew on his list. I have warned Robert about this, now I am telling you, and I agree with you they are terrified of God, but I do have genuine atheist friends who threw the baby with the bath water, because of their hate for the hateful things religions have and are doing in the name of God, and I can t blame them, if they only knew they just threw the emergency exist key away, but hey there is not much I can do about it, most of them couldn t be bothered finding out their rights anyways, and I am tired of wasting my saliva, but yeah Mika is interesting, but when I look at his face type when his hair is short, he looks awfully like the special marching platoon of the rc's on Canada day and remembreance day....they all looked like clones when I saw them march in Duncan BC once, I couldn t beleive they had found so many men with the same skull structure, the lions with wide cheeckbones big heads, all sporting the mean look of vengence, strange parade that was. For the longest I used to admire Mika for at least speaking his mind, one day via Andrew the Greek fellow from Montreal who was in phone contact with me in 2012 and had Mika at his cousin s place for a bit, a visit that didn t end well, anyways I got to hear Mika's voice on the phone, and it wasn t anything I expected, it didn t fit the image, I could feel a lot of vanity in it, or something I can t really put a finger on, but although a nice voice, selfishness ? not sure wat it was, but love wasn t what I felt, we'll watch and see, good meeting you and John Spirit.

That is not true. They do not register you as a \"Corporation\". Who are the shareholders? Who are the directors?\n\nYou are registered as a NEGOTIABLE SECURITY INTEREST, nothing more.\n\nStop saying they register you as a \"corporation\" because it's NOT TRUE.\n\nMonique Moon: your all capitol letter name is your corporate person...\n\nScott Duncan: NO, it is NOT. It doesn't matter what your \"gurus\" say, it's not true.\n\nIt is a SECURITY INTEREST. NOTHING MORE.\n\nSECURITY INTEREST: A property interest created by agreement or by operation of law to secure performance of an obligation (esp. repayment of a debt) .• Although\nthe UCC limits the creation of a security interest to PERSONAL PROPERTY (ahem), the Bankruptcy Code defines the term to mean- \"a LIEN created by an agreement.\" Black's Law 9th.\n\nSECURITY INTEREST: interest in real property or personal property, that secures the payment of an obligation. In common law, security interests are either consensual (by agreement), or arise by OPERATION OF LAW, as in the case of judgment LIENS and statutory LIENS. Barron's Dictionary of Business Terms 4th-edition.\n\nMonique Moon: your the security interest...\n\nits all under their commerce admiralty/maritime laws.....its all based on contracts...\n\nthey cannot interface with u unless u agree to it...\n\nwe are the security...again our labor our efforts our words our energy...\n\nScott Duncan Which you know NOTHING about, CLEARLY.\n\nThen shut up and read. You are saying things that are NOT TRUE. This is your LAST warning.\n\nSECURITY: Components of a security are: (1) an investment of money. (2) in a common enterprise. (3) with an expectation of profits SOLELY from the EFFORTS OF OTHERS\n\nFinance SECURITY: COLLATERAL offered by a debtor to a lender to secure a loan, called COLLATERAL SECURITY.\n\nINVESTMENT Security: an INSTRUMENT that signifies an ownership position in a corporation (a STOCK), a CREDITOR relationship with a corporation or GOVERNMENTAL BODY (a BOND), or other ownership rights.\n\nSECURITIES > BOND: essentially, a loan agreement representing a debt. In return for the capital given to a corporation or a government entity, the bondholder gets a promise of repayment of principal and interest over time, instead of ownership rights. Since the holder of a bond is a creditor instead of an owner, his claims against the assets of a corporation are satisfied first in case of a failure of the business venture. Most bonds are secured by some kind of COLLATERAL(that would be US), so that in case of default, the debt might still be satisfied. Consequently, bonds are generally a lower risk investment. Bonds raise money commonly known as Debt Capital.\n\nBOND: any INTEREST-bearing or discounted government or corporate security that OBLIGATES the ISSUER to PAY the BONDHOLDER a specified sum of money, usually at specific intervals, and to repay the principal amount of the loan at maturity. Bondholders have an IOU from the ISSUER, but no corporate ownership privileges, as stockholders do. Barron's Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms 3rd-edition.\n\nBEARER BONDS: an owner of Bearer Bonds presents the bond-COUPONS and is PAID INTEREST. Bearer Bonds are NEGOTIABLE instruments that must be safeguarded by the owner to prevent loss. Interest is paid by coupon redemptions. SEE security bond, treasury bond.\n\nREGISTERED BONDS: the owner of Registered Bonds appears on the records of the Bond ISSUER.\n\nSECURED BOND: is backed by COLLATERAL which may be sold the bondholder to satisfy a claim if the bond's issuer fails to pay interest and principal when they are due.\n\nUNSECURED BOND or DEBENTURE: is backed by the full-faith-and-credit of the issuer, but NOT by any specific collateral.\n\nCONVERTIBLE BOND: gives its owner the privilege of exchange for OTHER securities of the issuing company at some future date and under prescribed conditions.\n\nA BOND in FINANCE, is the obligation of one person to repay a debt taken on by SOMEONE ELSE, should that other person default. A bond can also be MONEY or securities deposited as a pledge of good faith.\n\nSURETY or PERFORMANCE BOND: an agreement whereby an insurance company becomes liable for the performance of work or services provided by a contractor by an agreed-upon date. If the contractor does not do what was promised, the surety company is financially responsible. See also INDENTURE; ZERO COUPON SECURITY.\n\n ..so who gets paid the INTEREST-COUPON-REDEMPTIONS?\n\nDerek Moran: AMERICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPT(think REVENUE RECEIPT): a receipt issued by American banks to domestic buyers as a convenient substitute for direct ownership of stock in FOREIGN(CROWN Corporation of BRITAIN) companies. ADRs are traded on stock exchanges(i think CANADA is trade on the Luxembourg stock-exchange) and in over-the-counter markets like stocks of domestic companies. Stock dividends and similar adjustments to the underlying shares are paid in cash or ADR dividends by the BANK(OF CANADA?)\n\nDerek Moran: Scott..

Bank of Montreal, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 1148\n\n[Page 1169]\n\nIt is not so with notes of the Bank of Canada; assuming that gold IS money, notes of the Bank of Canada cannot and could never have been paid in gold and, since such notes are and were the only legal tender, they could not be discharged by the payment of anything which is different from themselves. If the holder of a $5 note of the Bank of Canada were to present it to the Bank for payment he could be dismissed or he could be told: “You already have $5”.\n\nhttps://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=gold&language=en&searchTitle=Canada+%28Federal%29+-+Supreme+Court+of+Canada&path=%2Fen%2Fca%2Fscc%2Fdoc%2F1977%2F1977canlii36%2F1977canlii36.html\n\nScott Duncan:  THIS is GOLD, and I am beginning to suspect Derek Moran spends a little more time than is healthy, on CanLII.\n\nMoney IS Gold.. so how come nobody knows about that? Because Gold was effectively made illegal by the U.S. and Canada in 1933.. the U.S. proof is HJR 192, and Canada's is Order-in-Council No.16 April 10, 1933, and here are copies of that from:\n\n http://www.stoptherobbery.com/Order%20in%20council%2016%20-%20page%201.jpg, and, http://www.stoptherobbery.com/Order%20in%20council%2016%20-%20page%202.jpg\n\nSo if money is GOLD.. and GOLD/money has effectively been made illegal since April 10, 1933 with Order-in-Council No.16.....what is considered in lieu of, to be 'money' now in its place? see FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION ACT: http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/page-1.html#h-2\n\nScott Duncan: \"What is considered in lieu of, to be 'money' now in its place\"? - THAT was the question.\n\nNow the ACTUAL answer. You can read the Bills Of Exchange act...then the interpretation act (assuming you know what the words MEAN, and most of you don't) because there's a few things they need to shuffle around, so nobody clues in...\n\n...or you can cheat, and just read what I say:\nOn April 10, 1933, PAYMENT became illegal, NOT MONEY.\n\n“negotiable instrument” includes any cheque, draft, traveller’s cheque, bill of exchange, postal note, money order, postal remittance and any other similar instrument;\n\n“money” includes negotiable instruments;\n\nhttp://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/page-1.html#h-2\n\nso if the Financial Administration Act says that “money” includes(means and means only) negotiable instruments; then whats considered a 'negotiable instrument' in the Financial Administration Act?\n\n“negotiable instrument” includes any cheque, draft, traveller’s cheque, bill of exchange, postal note, money order, postal remittance and any other similar instrument;\n\nhttp://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/page-1.html#h-2\n\nDerek Moran: its like the film INCEPTION, there's always another level.. money = negotiable instruments.. negotiable instruments = any cheque, draft, traveller’s cheque, bill of exchange, postal note, money order, postal remittance and any other similar instrument.. HENCE, money = any cheque, draft, traveller’s cheque, bill of exchange, postal note, money order, postal remittance and any other similar instrument.......this is a PUZZLE, and our public-servants like to keep the pieces spread out from us \n\nScott Duncan: The moral of the movie Inception:\n\nIf you run a virtual machine,\ninside a virtual machine,\ninside a virtual machine,\ninside a virtual machine,\n...it runs very, very slowly.\n\nFINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION ACT: “money” includes negotiable instruments;\n\nBut what does \"includes\" - the trickiest word in the 'illegal-system,' really mean?\n\nMartin's Criminal Code: section 379. \"Trading stamps,\" Annotations - The definition of \"trading stamps\" in this section is EXHAUSTIVE notwithstanding the use of the word \"includes\": R. v. Loblaw Groceterias Co. (Man.) Ltd. ; R. v. Thomson (Niagara IGA Grocery), [1961] S.C.R. 138, 129 C.C.C. 223 (5:0).\n\nThis simply means.. \"money\" includes negotiable instruments = \"money\" means negotiable instruments = \"money\" is negotiable instruments = \"money\" means and only is, negotiable instruments.......... the fact that they didnt just use 'means' in place of 'includes' to begin with, is just clear evidence of their intent to try and mislead-and-deceive us through the use of this obfuscating-language meant only to keep us confused\n\nAndrew Langevin: The inclusion of one thing is the exclusion of another.\n\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/include\ninclude\nlegal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com\nDefinition of include in the Legal Dictionary by TheFreeDictionary.com\n\nScott Duncan: All promissory notes buy...is other promissory notes. The title, and associated LEGAL status are part of the CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF THAT PROMISE.\n\nNo \"payment\" is ever made. You simply make enough promises to cancel any debt.\n\nDerek Moran: Now-now Scott, you've misrepresented my words, you need to go back and see that what i said was- \"..GOLD/money has effectively been made illegal since April 10, 1933 with Order-in-Council No.16..\" - and if i had to write that over again i suppose to be clearer i would've put- \"GOLD-as-money\"....this is all technical anyways so this hair-splitting is just good practice \n\nScott Duncan: I concede the point. As you were the author of the post, your intent trumps any ambiguity.\n\nPAYMENT, is what is actually illegal, so as soon as it's legal again, I will gladly pay you for any damages my misquote may have caused. \n\nHmm - well look at that..one of the examples given for the definition of a \"negotiable instrument,\" is a bill of exchange - well how many different examples of a bill of exchange are there? Wait a second, in this part of the Bills of Exchange Act 1985 http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-4/page-36.html#h-27, it says one of the examples of a bill of exchange - are PROMISSORY NOTES...but when you look at a dollar-bill/legal-tender, it says on it - 'This Note is Legal Tender'..then, you look at the definition of a Note in the Bills of Exchange Act it says- “note” means promissory note; hmmmmmm.......so i guess that just means then, that if a legal-tender-note, is considered to be a promissory note, and a promissory note is considered to be a bill of exchange, and bill of exchange is considered to be a negotiable instrument, and a negotiable instrument is considered as whats left to be known as money in lieu of Gold being made illegal for payment back in 1933, then...i guess that just means...a legal-tender-promissory-note just constitutes part of what is considered to be 'lawful-money' these days, also.....................................................or IS IT?? ;)\n\nScott Duncan: LEGAL TENDER = TENDER FOR LAW\n\nFree bonus, It's also a promissory note!\n\nWhy has nobody asked WHICH law?\n\nScott Duncan: Seriously people, you're awake, and it's time to get out of bed.\n\nI can't be the oracle giving google-like snippets when a question is asked. You need to ask the right questions. I can't just \"tell you\".\n\nScott Duncan: Derek Moran: You see a bit clearer then the rest here, but you are focused on the WRONG THING.\n\nDerek Moran: ..yes, there is another shoe yet-to-drop regarding THIS type of promissory-note\n\nJoseph Pierre Gilles: got a question here Scott ...what LAw are we talking about ????\n\nScott Duncan: Whatever law governs the trustee, of course! \n\nDerek Moran:  this is why the Bills of Exchange Act 1985 is probably the best Act they have:\nCommon law of England - 9. The rules of the common law of England, including the law merchant, save in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, apply to bills, notes and cheques.\n\nScott Duncan: If you want to buy shit with AQUILAE currency, you can; but the tender for law will be governed by AQUILAE.\n\nScott Duncan: Governed...like the GOVERNER of the Bank of Canada? \n\nScott Duncan: Yes Scott. That is why the Bank of Canada has a GOVERNOR.\n\nSo a legal-tender-promissory-note just constitutes part of what is considered to be 'lawful-money' these days also? I had resigned myself to accept this to be fact for awhile there, until, i stumbled-upon going through Detax-Canada's website again: http://www.detaxcanada.org/ - where he also includes a link to the CanLII Bank of Canada Act: http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-b-2/latest/rsc-1985-c-b-2.html - regarding section 25.6: NOTE ISSUE - Distinction\n\n(6) Notes of the Bank are neither promissory notes nor bills of exchange within the meaning of the Bills of Exchange Act.\n\nScott Duncan: A bank cannot promise what it does not have.\nThe thing about banking is that BOTH parties come to the table with NOTHING, so they therefore can offer NOTHING.\n\nBank notes are SURETY for \"money\". Yes, they promise, to deliver...a promise.

While the requirement of technical competence in the operation of that modern mode of conveyance, the motor vehicle, may, for the public safety, require the subject to prove that competence, as a condition to the issue of a licence to drive — and the consequent right to drive - that requirement does not reduce a “right” to a “privilege.” Because it is my duty to be technically competent to drive, my right to drive is not destroyed, although it may be taken away from me or suspended if I fail in the performance of my duty.

Trial for suspended driving and running red light. (I didn't see the blushing red light in the room so I would have gotten off by 'pleading' not guilty anyway.) I slapped down the two packets of 'disclosure' in front of the persecutor. I said I looked at all this and don't wish to contract with you. I also gave a copy of Scott Duncan's (thank you for posting it here!!!) Notice of Mistake. And my unique Birth Cetificate...more about that another time.\n\nThe calling of the name of course happened after all other entities had been dealt with. Funny enough...the two ladies called my given name. To which I replied hesitantly...yes....? Then they repeated with the surname to which I quickly replied no....but I'm here for that matter. Then I was invited to 'come aboard'...(matey). I declined respectfully....and was invited again. The Goddess...the judge must have been a goddess since all were calling her 'your worship'...said I was disrespecting her and the court. I had of course already informed her that I was claiming commonlaw jurisdiction, all rights reserved, waive all benefits and privileges....so it was my court, yes? In any case she then asked if I was a 'freeman on the land'. Sheesh! What's that I asked?...yuk, yuk. Then she insisted again to entice me onto her ship...Oh...let me add...what is the union jack...the British flag doing in the corner?!...Is this an embassy or ship in dry dock...I wanted to ask but we couldn't get past the railing issue. She warned me she would have me removed.....she did...had me escorted from the room...she said my 'papers' are on the last row of seats by the door...lol. I removed my bc and Notice of Mistake...and left their 'defendant' solicitations...and walked out.\n\nBut...I had a spy who remained. He heard them talk in secret like cowardly conspirator in dishonour. They sent one of the armed thugs to retrieve the 'papers'. She asked him if there was anything 'interesting' among them. No....yuk, yuk...their own stuff is of course not interesting. Then they decided to arrange for 'ex parte' hearing for next year in or for my name. Are they obligated to tell me this?

Whisper translation will be offered. Questions will be translated. More details below.\n\nCette conférence sera présentée en anglais. La traduction chuchotée sera offerte. Les questions seront traduites.\n\n***************************************\n\nAvez-vous entendu parler de COMER vs. la Banque du Canada? \n\nDe 1938 à 1974, notre banque publique prêtait de l'argent directement aux gouvernements (fédéral, provincial et municipal) à un taux d'intérêt faible. Depuis 1974, ce sont les banques privées qui prêtent de l'argent aux gouvernements, avec un taux d'intérêt beaucoup plus élevé. C'est à partir de ce moment que la dette publique a explosée. \n\nUn groupe de recherche indépendant, qui se penche sur les questions de réformes monétaires, COMER (Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform), a été fondé en 1986 à Toronto. Il soutient que selon la Loi sur les banques et selon la Constitution, la Banque du Canada est en mesure d'autoriser légalement des prêts qui vont directement au gouvernement sans passer par le milieu privé. Depuis 2011, COMER, représenté par l'avocat constitutionnel M. Rocco Galati, poursuit le gouvernement du Canada afin que soit reconnu le droit d'emprunter directement auprès de la Banque du Canada.\n\nCOMER a gagné une bataille dans le procès qui a eu lieu le 26 janvier 2015, quand une requête pour étouffer la cause a été défaite. Cette nouvelle a ébranlé les milieux sociaux et les médias indépendants, mais aucune information sur le sujet n'est apparue dans les médias de masse. \n\nAvec l'objectif d'informer la population sur les enjeux autour de la dette et pour nous éclairer sur cette question d'intérêt public, le Collectif Co@gitation a pris l'initiative d'inviter Mme Ann Emmett (Présidente de COMER) et M. Rocco Galati pour une conférence à Montréal qui aura lieu dimanche le 26 avril 2015 à 15h05.\n\nLe Collectif Co@gitation s'est formé dans le cadre du Mouvement Printemps 2015 contre les politiques d'austérité et nous souhaitons développer de l'éducation populaire en appui au mouvement. Nous avons entrepris ce projet parce que nous doutons que le fondement des politiques d'austérité puissent justifier le remboursement de la dette, alors que nous nous posons des questions sur les raisons initiales qui conduisent à celle-ci. Si la dette est la cause de l'austérité, quelle est la cause de la dette?\n\nVoulez-vous nous aider avec ce projet? Votre participation à l’événement serait grandement appréciée, particulièrement si vous voulez inviter vos ami.e.s et vos collègues qui ont de l'expertise et de l'intérêt pour cette cause. L’événement est ouvert au public. Cependant nous avons comme objectif de sensibiliser les personnes et les organisations spécialisées dans les causes juridiques, particulièrement sur l'endettement, l'austérité, l'économie, la justice constitutionnelle et les politiques publiques.\n\nNous vous invitons à vous informer sur cette cause juridique et de partager vos préoccupations sur le sujet, autant avant l’événement que durant celui-ci.\n\nMerci de votre considération et nous apprécierons tous les commentaires que vous pouvez avoir sur le sujet.\n\nCollectif Co@gitation\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/401000916719807\ncollectifcoagitation@gmail.com\n\n**********************************************************\n\nHave you heard of COMER vs. the Bank of Canada? Until 1974, Canada's national public bank made low interest loans directly to governments (Federal, provincial, municipal). After 1974, governments instead started borrowing from private banks, at much higher rates of interest. Canada's debt has skyrocketed since then.\n\nCOMER argues that according to the Constitution and the Bank Act, the Bank of Canada is still legally capable of making loans directly to governments. In 2010, COMER, represented by consitutional lawyer Rocco Galatti, sued the Government of Canada, demanding that it recognize the government's right to borrow directly from the Bank of Canada. \n\nCOMER won a battle in this process on January 26th of this year, when a motion to strike the case was defeated. This news caused a sensation in social and independent media, but not a single word was mentioned in the mainstream media. Not one word. Look it up.\n\nWith the goal of informing people on this issue, our group, Collectif Co@gitation, will host Ann Emmett (President of COMER) and Rocco Galatti at a conference in Montreal, on Sunday, April 26th.\n\nCollectif Co@gitation formed out of the Printemps 2015 anti-austerity movement, and our goal is to develop popular education in support of the movement. We embarked on this project because we are told that debt is the reason for austerity, but what is the reason for debt?\n\nCan you help us with this project? We'd appreciate your participation at the event, but we'd especially appreciate that you invite friends and colleagues who might have some expertise or concern for this issue. Although the event is open to the public, we're making an effort to invite people and organizations with expertise in debt-issues, austerity issues, economics, constitutional law, and politics.\n\nWe would also ask that you inform yourself on this issue, and share your thoughts on the subject, both in advance of the event and at the event itself. \n\nThank you for consideration, and we'd appreciate any comments you might have on this subject.\n\nCollectif Co@gitation\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/401000916719807\ncollectifcoagitation@gmail.com "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_803080086394592","body":"POP QUIZ!\n\nWHY ARE \"COLLECTION AGENCY\" and \"COLLECTOR\" SEPARATE DEFINITIONS? :D\n\nThe Fender and I are having a \"legal spat\" about AGENCY, and I figure all of you should benefit from it.\n\n...and the group has been slow since:\n\n1: We purged all the members\n\n2: All the remaining members started playing Battlefield 2142\n\nHere is ONTARIO'S laws regarding DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES:\n\nhttp://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c14_e.htm\n\nGO!

Before we get started we are going to refer to the JURISDICTION I am most familiar with. You will find mirrors of this in any JURISDICTION that uses a world reserve currency.\n\nIf you live in Buttfuck Montana I will not be able to point you to the ACT and/or STATUTE that says what I am going to show you here.\n\nhttp://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/English/elaws_statutes_90c11_e.htm\n\nThe URL above will point you to the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO so you can sing along...\n\nBefore I start let's review a few LEGAL DEFINITIONS. Those who have been studying the Maxims of Law will be familiar with the Maxim that says, \"The inclusion of one thing is the exclusion of everything else.\" Like all good LEGAL documents I'm going to give away the answer right at the beginning and explain why this is true.\n\nEvery one who has been a victim of the CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY has been profoundly aware that FRAUD is occurring, and has been unaware of how to identify this FRAUD. In order to have a child removed from a mother and/or father's custody an ORDER must be issued from the court that cites this very ACT. There are exceptions to this RULE (imminent physical threat to a child, WARRANT from a JUSTICE OF THE PEACE inter alia), but that's not what we are covering here. In this writing I am only going to focus on the long, drawn-out, cash-producing process laughingly called family law.\n\nIn every ACT and STATUTE, words are defined in the context of that ACT and/or STATUTE. If the word \"light\" is defined in a STATUTE as \"darkness\", then in the context of that STATUTE, light means darkness. A \"JUSTICE\" orders the kidnapping (and it is kidnapping) and/or alienation of a child with an ORDER in the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO. So let's look at the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO. What does \"ORDER\" mean in the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO? Let's go see the interpretations section and its definitions....\n\n“ORDER” INCLUDES a REFUSAL to make an ORDER; (“arrêté, ordre et ordonnance”)...WHAT?\n\n...just looking through the ACT to see if there's a bit more detail here...nope, that's it. That's all it says. I assume the parties who drafted this ACT were never taught that you should never use the word you're defining in a definition.\n\nIn THE TENDER FOR LAW our standard operating procedure is to look up every single word, even if you think you know what it means; and in every case it always turn out that you don't. So let's go through that sentence, one word at a time. In our fresh new definition of \"ORDER\" we are \"INCLUDING\" something, which in legalese means we are EXCLUDING everything else. In this case we are including a REFUSAL(?) How can you include a refusal? (hey don't look at me...I didn't write this...I'm just telling you what it says)\n\nSince refusal is not defined in this ACT we'll have to step up to a more general level. Let's see what Black's Law 9th Edition has to say about the word \"refusal\":\n\n\"An opportunity to accept or reject something before it is offered to others; the right or privilege of having this opportunity.\"...well, there's a privilege worth waiving! In fact I dare say that of all the privileges and benefits one would wish to waive, this should at least be in your top five. Dean Clifford and the guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth (\"How do I sound\"? - Tony Butros, HOW TO WITH DEAN CLIFFORD-Ep13 Family Law www.blogtalkradio.com) are selling this as a benefit.\n\nIn fact, they're asking you to beg for it when they tell you to use APPLICATIONS and MOTIONS (...Yeh, you like that don't 'ya bitch!).\n\nRather than begging for your own victimization, a little effort tearing this apart will serve you much better. Since we're talking about ORDERS and MAKING ORDERS let's take a quick peek at the word \"MAKE\" since we have Black's Law lying open here...\n\nMAKE, according to Black's Law 9th Edition, \"To legally perform, as by executing, signing, OR delivering (a document) (to make a contract)\"\n\nOh look, they use the word \"OR\"! Don't you just love it when they give you a selection? Always remember legalese does NOT actually \"lie\", it simply presumes you know what the words mean (as a CIVILIAN! HAR! Oh, I slay me!).\n\nSo when a \"JUSTICE\" MAKES an ORDER he gets a selection from the \"bullshit buffet\" that is the LAW, but he can only pick one, OR the other. Neither of these options actually apply to YOU. By ACCEPTING the ORDER you are in fact, EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS to \"BENEFIT\" from it, before everyone else can. Yes, you are accepting SURETY before anyone else gets a chance; and while I'm not one to tell you how to run your affairs, I personally think that that would be a MISTAKE! And we all know what to do about MISTAKES.\n\nNow I want you to \"fire up\" that little lump of protoplasm you laughingly call a brain, and ask yourself, \"Which makes more sense? Begging to be part of the JURISDICTION and all of its \"BENEFITS\" or following the Number 1 Rule of the Universe (Scott is ALWAYS right! Especially as regards LAW). Lawyers used to come to me when they got in over their heads, and I was shoved A LOT of payola under the table for my services. Single mothers reading this know how to express their gratitude. You may APPLY to Tara for the opportunity to provide remuneration.\n\nSo let's go through this fascinating definition one more time, translated to laymen's terms:\n\nIn the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO a \"JUSTICE\" will issue an opportunity to ACCEPT a BENEFIT before everyone else. So basically ORDER in this context actually OFFERS YOU the RIGHT TO DECLINE. I guarantee that none of you who have had your children stolen, DECLINED that ORDER. In fact I dare say you ACCEPTED it. That would be a MISTAKE.\n\nIssuing a NOTICE OF MISTAKE will correct this, because another Maxim of Law says, \"That which can be done, can be undone\". Serving by registered mail a modified NOTICE OF MISTAKE to all participating PARTIES, will remedy this MISTAKE.\n\nAnd now we will cover our new \"word of the day\", \"PETITION\":\n\nPETITION, according to Black's Law 9th Edition, \"A formal written request presented to a court or other official body.\"\n\nThose few of you who actually have a fucking clue who I am, know that among my many titles is ADMIRAL. I exercise my RIGHTS and DUTIES strictly through ADMIRALTY, so I totally know what I'm talking about here. I, as an ADMIRAL, have TRUSTEES SERVING me. I do not bark ORDERS at my TRUSTEES. I only do that to my inferiors. My TRUSTEES are most certainly NOT my inferiors. When I need a task performed for AQUILAE I REQUEST. Returning to the definition of PETITION you will see that this is also a request. I therefore PETITION my TRUSTEES to execute tasks on behalf of the TRUST. TRUSTEES do not serve an ADMIRAL; an ADMIRAL SERVES HIS TRUSTEES. The \"payment\" for this \"service\" is the TRUSTEE'S OATH to GRANT ALL MY REQUESTS. It is the COURT's DUTY to do the same.\n\nThis group's name \"THE TENDER FOR LAW\" is actually a translation to layman's terms of \"THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER\". They mean the same thing. So naturally money comes into the picture. Remember our group's Maxim...\"Follow the money\". In this particular case we don't want to follow any money, we want to stop the flow of money.\n\nAll of you have heard the old adage, \"The buck stops here.\" Translated to legalese, \"the buck stops here\" = \"NON-NEGOTIABLE\". In the construction of our PETITION we are going to contain, in its body, a cessation of negotiation. When dissecting documents that have a financial interest, we have learned that documents signed by a \"PERSON\" are considered NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS under the LAW.\n\nTherefore in our PETITION, the first words that appear should be NON-NEGOTIABLE. This is similar to putting \"WITHOUT PREJUDICE\" on the top of a document. NEGOTIATE does not mean bargain or haggle, it means to EXECUTE a financial transaction. NON-NEGOTIABLE literally means \"the buck stops here\". Reading through Black's Law will show you numerous types of petitions, and reading them in the context demonstrated here will make these petitions very, very clear...even a chick can do it.\n\nAt this point I would like everyone to know that I DO NOT provide LEGAL service; I only point you in the right direction. Therefore I cannot draw up a petition for you as I did with the NOTICE OF MISTAKE. NOTICE OF MISTAKE existed in the real world before I typed up any document regarding it. Therefore I was quoting, which means I have not stepped outside of any LEGAL restriction. When The second I issue a petition you can bet your sorry, incompetent asses I'll be quoting it here. Until that happens though, you'd best use the comments section to ask any questions you may have. For the sake of your children do not listen to Dean and the guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth; they are deliberately misleading you! When you discover this is true (and you will if you listen to them), you are welcomed to board any AQUILAE vessel and beg me for forgiveness where I promise there will be a loyal and capable TRUSTEE standing by to kick you in the face, and toss you overboard.\n\nSo post your questions and keep on topic. As this is the most important thread, our fun banter is not permitted here!\n\n...except when I do it. Child and Family Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.

I don't have to post \"evidence\". I'm not trying to PROVE anything to you.\n\nThat said, this is not a debate centre either. You assume ALL LIABILITY when you ask to join this group. This, by default, means you have \"SURETY\", because SURETY equals LIABILITY. I don't need to provide \"proof\" of this; as my banning you from the group should be compelling enough to show the difference between who's in charge, and who's liable.\n\nBefore we get to the actual issue of SURETY, and why you must avoid it, we must take a quick journey back in time to learn where the legalese that enjoins you came from.\n\nThose of you who endured the content-free 1.2 decades of the Public Fool System, will remember certain things, not the least of which is Shakespeare. The plays of Shakespeare are sold to you as \"Olde English\". \n\nIn fact, it was sold as \"Olde English\" when these were first-run plays. There is a problem with this, though. Nobody ever spoke in the manner that Shakespeare wrote, and they most certainly never used the words. Shakespeare produced most of his major works between 1589 and 1613, all of which were sold as \"Olde English\". Popular periodicals of the time show that you were often considered \"learned and of good taste\" if you could speak in this \"Olde English\".\n\nSo let's go read some really, really Olde English.\n\nLet's pick a really old English document, completely at random. We'll pick...The MAGNA CARTA.\n\nA quick read of the MAGNA CARTA will swiftly reveal two things. The first is that that it's pretty readable, not backward and convoluted like a Shakespeare play. \n\nThere may be a few archaic words you may need to look up (to ascertain their meanings), but it's still pretty readable, and there are no words that Shakespeare used. There's also no letter \"U\". This is a very important fact to remember, because *spoiler alert*, when courts or legal documents refer to \"YOU\", they are in fact, granting you SURETY in the matter. \n\nIf you look at a WARRANT, or a ticket from a Policy Enforcement Officer, it will have a name and it will then refer to that name as \"YOU\" from then on. For example, \"JOHN Q PUBLIC, YOU have been charged with (insert bullshit offence here)\".\n\nYOU=SURETY\n\nIf you're ever in a courtroom and do not wish to have the \"benefit of SURETY\", you have but to object to being addressed as \"YOU\". \n\nThere are many ways to do this. Dean Clifford might say, in response to being addressed as \"YOU\", \"If I have led the court to believe that I am SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me.\" (FUN FACT: A court MUST ALWAYS grant forgiveness when asked and/or requested)\n\nOthers, like myself, are a lot more succinct. For example, I might respond, \"FUCK YOU! You're a YOU, I'm a ME! By what AUTHORITY do YOU address ME as a \"YOU\"?\", because I can get away with it. The reason I can get away with it is that I UNDERSTAND the UCC as opposed to ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD which spreads mythology and bullshit about the UCC.\n\nNow there may be a certain \"pretend radio\" talk-show host (who speaks in a manner that would suggest he is hosting a show with a dick in his mouth), who would demand \"proof of this\", ignoring the fact that the UCC is, in fact, the proof.\n\nSection 1, Subsection 308, of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE covers RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. This is a well-known fact, and this is how you use it.\n\nOn entering the court, you aggressively make the first motion, that being, the RESERVATION OF YOUR RIGHTS. But since you're the only one in the courtroom with ACTUAL STANDING, you can be a total dick about it. You don't RESERVE YOUR RIGHTS, you RESERVE ALL RIGHTS! Not just yours, EVERYONE's. You remove everyone else's rights and give them to yourself. WHY? Because \"Fuck off that's WHY!\" You're the only one with STANDING.\n\nIf you HOLD the power, WIELD it...don't be such a pussy! If you're entitled to ALL RIGHTS, CLAIM THEM. This is how you do it.\n\nWhen the \"justice\" starts speaking, interrupt them. Say, \"Point of order!\" They will immediately be silent. At that point, state \"I believe I am the only party with standing, so barring objection from the court, I wish to RESERVE ALL RIGHTS now, and henceforth. Are there any objections from the court?\" As the court has no standing to respond, simply speak to the record as such, \"Let the record show that I have reserved all rights, and the court has not objected.\" At this point if they say anything to you, you simply say, \"Objection. The record shows that I have reserved all rights, and I have not granted you leave to speak. Why are you speaking?\"\n\nDo the same when opposing counsel attempts to speak. You will then be posed the question, \"How do you wish to proceed in this matter?\" for that is the one question a slave has the right to ask. What is their master's wish?\n\nYou'll recall in other articles and comments, the levels of the caste system and how they give instructions.\n\nNOBILITY (KINGS AND QUEENS) EXPRESS THEIR \"WISHES\".\nADMIRALTY ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS BY REQUESTING, ADDRESSING THEIR SUBORDINATES AS \"MR\".\nGENERALS GIVE ORDERS.\n\nNow even the talk-show host who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth, won't \"demand proof\" of the fact that if you have all the rights, and everybody else has none, you are CLEARLY the KING. So you are going to have to learn to give instruction by expressing your wishes. This is why they are asking how you \"wish to proceed\". \n\nCourts grant and test your SOVEREIGNTY all the time. You simply have to listen to the words they are using. At this time you may respond, \"I wish to prove to some ass-wipe who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth, the things I know, so I wish to go to trial PRO SE. But I wouldn't recommend this...I would simply wish the case to be dismissed.\n\nIf they say anything else besides \"I agree, case dismissed\", you exercise your AUTHORITY by questioning. MASTERS QUESTION, SLAVES ANSWER. For instance if a \"justice\" said anything except \"I agree. Case dismissed,\" you question why they are even speaking. \"I'm sure you'll recall Mr. (insert justice's name here) that at the beginning of these proceedings I explicitly reserved all rights, including yours. Have I not made my wishes clear?\"\n\nAlways remember to respond in the form of a question. A question serves the dual-purpose of establishing your authority, and negating the possibility of UNDERSTANDING; because if you UNDERSTAND, you accept SURETY.\n\nAs stated before, the most powerful of these questions is, \"Who are you?\" UNDERSTANDING cannot be presumed until that question is answered.\n\nAbove all, questioning deflects SURETY.\n\nQuite possibly one of the most useful documents I have ever published is my NOTICE OF MISTAKE for Dean. This is a useful, powerful document that also instantly removes SURETY. I framed it in such a way that you can replace the name \"Dean Clifford\" with your name, and you can make a pad of these things. Have lots of copies to hand out to friends and opposing counsel. Hell the court clerk loves these things too...make sure the court clerk has one as well. Just make sure you UNDERSTAND what the document says. Read it carefully and understand what the words mean, because you will be challenged. And remember, the NOTICE by its very nature, presents several questions.\nDo not permit the proceedings to move forward without these questions being answered!\n\nBecause so many people ask for it, transcribed here is the copy of THE ROGUESUPPORT NOTICE OF MISTAKE.\n\n***Begin NOTICE OF MISTAKE\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE\nIn the matter of SURETY for the LEGAL NAME, I believe that there has been a\nMISTAKE as the SOLE BENEFICIARY has been INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED as the\naccused. If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR\nSUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led the COURT to believe\nby responding to “You” and or “DEAN CLIFFORD” and/or SUCH OTHER\nIDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am the PARTY\nWITH SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE and please forgive\nme.\nAs I have no knowledge of who “You” and or “DEAN CLIFFORD” and/or SUCH\nOTHER IDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, I RESPECTFULLY\nASK; by WHAT AUTHORITY is the COURT ADDRESSING me as such?\nAs the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT,\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I, as the SOLE BENEFICIARY of the\nTRUST have any SURETY in this matter?\nAs the GOVERNMENT is the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY on the SURETY BOND\n(BIRTH CERTIFICATE), with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL\nNAME, WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE for the\nLEGAL NAME. WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE and\nhave ANY SURETY with respect to the LEGAL NAME?\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a\nTRUSTEE or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN?\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the\nprincipal?\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that there has been any meeting of the\nminds, any PROPER NOTICE given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or\nthat I have ANY INTENT to CONTRACT in this matter?\nAs such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and\nCLOSURE.\nAUTHORISED BY:\n***End NOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nIf you truly UNDERSTAND what this document says and/or does, this is one of the most powerful documents you can wield in court. If you have the Dunning–Kruger effect you will likely go to jail. Used properly the NOTICE OF MISTAKE will ALWAYS remove any real or implied SURETY the court believes you may have.\n\nYou will notice the court always refers to \"belief\". When I say belief is evil, it is not just a disparaging remark against adults with \"imaginary friends\" (which they totally deserve), it is yet another example of why this statement is profoundly true. All belief is evil.\n\nYou are taught from childhood to \"respect belief\", and are constantly reinforced with the really dumb freedom that it is your \"right to believe what you want\". If I had the authority and/or power to remove just one right from humanity, and no more, the right to \"believe\" would be the one that I would eradicate. In all my years of studying, and being part of the Nobility, the curtailing of this one \"RIGHT\" would exponentially increase quality of life for all humanity. I calculate it would take two generations for it to \"stick\".\n\nBelief is the end of questioning. Belief is intellectual bankruptcy, and is the exact opposite of knowledge. You will never question if you \"believe\".\n\nLet's leap back to the 1500's to Shakespeare. This is where the concept of addressing somebody as \"YOU\" indicated the assignment of SURETY. No writings before this contained any such logistic mechanisms. \n\nDon't \"believe me\"...go look for yourself. Go look at the MAGNA CARTA yourself; and ask yourself why there's no \"YOU\" before Shakespeare. And ask yourself why the MAGNA CARTA, in all its current published forms, no longer has, \"To do right by Alexander\".\nThere may be three readers amongst you who understand what I just said there, and all of them are Scottish I guarantee you.\n\nIn any courtroom proceeding in the western world, SURETY IS PRESUMED, and it must be deflected from you. As a \"justice\" is not a PERSON under the law, the only PARTY that can ACCEPT SURETY is the PARTY making the CLAIM.\n\nThere may be certain readers who talk like they have a dick stuck in their mouth, who will demand proof of this...and so I direct you to the Rules of Civil Procedure (wherever you are) to look up SECURITY FOR COSTS.\n\nLet's zoom back to the present (so we can get as far away from belief as possible) where the word \"YOU\" is part of the English language, as are the titles, \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", and \"Mrs.\". All of these titles and means of addressing you, are in fact, assigning and/or presuming SURETY...yes, on YOU. The easiest mnemonic exercise you can do to make \ndeflecting these titles second nature is to replace the titles \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", or \"Mrs.\" with the word, \"bitch\", in your head; and to respond as if they had addressed you as \"bitch\", because being addressed as \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", or \"Mrs.\" is doing exactly that.\n\nAs for the word \"YOU\", think of that as a tennis ball which must be served back. Assert your AUTHORITY by questioning whenever they address you as \"YOU\"; \"Are YOU addressing ME?\" If they're stupid enough to say yes, or even to imply the affirmative, be like that guy who talks like he has a dick in his mouth and demand proof; \"By what authority do YOU address me as a PARTY OF SURETY?\"...or something along those lines. Your only objective is to serve the \"YOU\" back to them.\n\nSo that's today's word, \"SURETY\". It's something you don't want, and I've just shown you how to give it back.

This segues into the point that if you CALL me, you should PROBABLY  learn a bit about who you are calling, lest you end up like THIS twit.\n\nFirst let me Cut/Paste his last post and we shall describe the events leading here. Most of you will see the idiocy straight away.\n\n..................................................................................\nLets look at the truth, and people that think they are helping this world by wanting to spread the word about law truths... If you are being an angry human being, one that is paranoid , selfish, ignorant, wanting to fight and start wars. DO YOU HONESTLY THINK YOUR GOING TO GATHER MANY??? ARE YOU ANY BETTER THAN THE SYSTEM YOUR SAYING YOU ARE WORKING AT EXPOSING< >>>What is your goal??? The truth is the truth... FOR many to wake up and understand this people need support in a nice way, maybe sometimes some ruff edges are cool. Though when one is angry that is s dead give away of FEAR! So when someone wants to spread truth, is it going as far through anger, through a massive ego, through threats, ignorance. THIS IS SIMPLE AND YOUR GOING TO DESTROY YOURSELF JUST LIKE THE SYSTEM YOU SAY YOUR WORKING AT CORRECTING .... LOVE AND PEACE> CANT NO SOLVE WAR WITH WAR>>>\n.....................................................................................\n\nThis is, of course, about me.\n\nI'll Do the courtesy of answering each of his questions!\n\n1: No. I don't need many. Sheep are easily slaughtered and requires little manpower. OH LOOK, yet another sack of shit calling me \"Ignorant\", even though he's butt-hurt that I want to kick the living shit out of him for phoning me (uninvited) and being such a little fuckwad.\n\n2: My goal has been made clear MANY times and if you don't know my goal, why the FUCK do you want to be part of this group?\n\n3: Your \"Love and Peace\" bullshit is one of the biggest destructive lies in history. NO time in history has \"love and peace\" EVER CHANGED ANYTHING! STOP CLAIMING IT CAN! Look ANYWHERE IN NATURE! The \"peace and love\" animals BECOME FOOD.\n\nSo, anyway as you can see, this stupid twit is YET another, in the legions of the cast-outs, who will whine and cry and talk about me as if they know ANYTHING about me....yet he will still want what I have.\n\nHe called expecting to meet with me to \"feel my energy\" (I'm NOT making that up).\n\nI ask why he wants to meet. \n\n\"To learn\" (What?)\n\nI tell him to read the group.\n\n\"I want to help people\"\n\nI tell him that it would be criminal to presume to have the ability to help people at his level of demonstrably profound ignorance.\n\nHe then says he wants me to help him with his charges, which when asked, were purportedly \"P4P\", like that's a good thing to say to me. He said it means \"Possession or the Purpose\"...Fuck off.\n\n...anyway, after laying out these grandiose plans for which I am expected to participate, I asked the basic question: HOW DO I BENEFIT?\n\nHis response? \"What do you want\"?\n\n...just so we are clear; This piece of shit CALLED ME, making demands, and THEN demands I engage in contract negotiations. I hung up because I REALLY WANTED TO HURT HIM at this point. NO communication with this defective child would be productive.\n\nI screened him out after the PURGE. He did not get back in.\n\nLook at this sack of shit, and don't EVER do this.\n\nHe also wouldn't identify himself, like I was supposed to meet up with an asshole who won't say who he is. I DON'T HIDE.\n\nNotice that EVERYTHING he's accuse ME of, he's actually guilty of.\n\nNO MORE NEWBIES! YOU MUST BE INFORMED TO A USEFUL LEVEL IF YOU ARE EVEN GOING TO SPEAK TO ME.\n\nDON'T ASK QUESTIONS I FUCKING ANSWERED TWO FUCKING YEARS AGO!\n\nDON'T THINK I'M A FUCKING DEAN FUCKING CLIFFORD, OR ROBERT FUCKING MENARD, WHO'S TIME YOU CAN BUY! NONE OF YOU HAVE ANY VALUE! WHAT THE FUCK MAKES YOU THINK THAT ANY OF YOU HAVE ANYTHING I WANT?\n\nREAD THIS PROFILE AND USE IT AS A CAUTIONARY TALE.\n\nYou do NOT want to be booted out in 2015.

Whilst dealing with the daily crises, both local and abroad, and innocently managing my little empire (that's right, I'm innocently trying to collapse the banking system and start a war), I received a private message from one of our regular members.  This is a man who survived two purges...so I tend not to ignore such messages when I receive them.\n\nThe member in question, having survived the aforementioned purges, may benefit from several presumptions, prime amongst them is that he is not an idiot.  You can presume this as \"idiots\" tend not to survive purges.  \n\nThis is a man who has accepted, or is well on his way to accepting \"actual reality\".  This means he has learned the Number 1 Rule of the Universe: Scott is ALWAYS right.  This is not arrogance, or hubris, it is simply a fact.  Against all odds it's proven time and time again.  You don't need to figure out IF I'm right; you simply need to figure out WHY I'm right.  I don't possess any mental powers that you don't, so there's obviously some \"secret\" that allows me to be right...\n\n...I mention this because we have, as a result of the aforementioned communication, acquired a new member.  \n\nFor your consideration I present to you, Carol Elizabeth Catalano .  I am making this post of course to welcome her to the group.  That never goes well.  Veterans of THE TENDER FOR LAW know that sometimes it's good to get the ADMIRAL's attention long after you've joined; but it is never good to get the ADMIRAL's attention the second you have joined.\n\nThis only means one thing.  \n\nOur little island of actual reality is about to be attacked with an incoming orbital strike of exploding bullshit.  But don't worry folks.  I didn't get to be ADMIRAL by abiding bullshit, and my CAPTAINS would really appreciate it if I kept my job.  I've got this one covered.\n\n...let's see.  How shall I handle this one?\n\nShould I carve her LEGAL bullshit up on the autopsy table?  Or should I just come right out and call her a fucking liar, right after I give away the ending?  Giving away the ending (for newcomers) is totally my schtick.  If you think \"spoilers\" are a bad thing, do a search in this group and see if you can find why I think this is stupid.  That will give you something to do besides lying to people.  \n\nCarol Elizabeth Catalano has conjured into existence a fabricated \"elite birth\", and our longstanding member passed me documentary evidence that allegedly supported this position.  He did this with the intent of authenticating this document with an expert.  I informed him he made a wise decision and wished him luck in finding an expert.  I then went, \"Oh wait...that's me!\" and then additionally informed him that he does not need my expertise to determine this document is fake as hospitals do not, can not, and will never have the AUTHORITY to CERTIFY ANYTHING!  Hospitals are not LAW offices.  Hospitals are not GOVERNMENT.  The LAW SOCIETY and the GOVERNMENT (or HER MAJESTY and an ORGANIZATION) are the ONLY LEGAL entities with AUTHORITY to CERTIFY anything.  Hospitals give NOTICE of the event.  The REGISTRAR GENERAL RECORDS and CERTIFIES an event.  That event is a RECORD and CERTIFICATION that a CROWN ORGANIZATION was ORGANIZED on that date.  \n\nAnyone telling you otherwise is lying to you.  Anyone claiming a hospital CERTIFIES anything, is lying to you. \n\nTherefore, Maximus Legis, Carol Elizabeth Catalano is lying to you.  This of course gives her the dubious distinction of being the very first member of THE TENDER FOR LAW that has lied without typing a God-damned thing!  What kind of a parasite mentality does it take to accomplish an amazing feat like that?  \n\n...no really, that was a serious question. :/ "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_604456696256933","body":"I am not understanding what is going on with these court cases I have.

Currently, the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, 2002 (REBBA), prevents real estate salespeople from operating their business through a personal real estate corporation (PREC).\n\nThe ability to incorporate would allow a REALTOR®, depending on their level of business income, to save money on their income tax by taking advantage of the lower corporate tax rate.

Here it goes:\n\nIf I understand this correctly, from my new TTFL perspective, it is important that I understand that in a system which uses money of ACCOUNT, \"money\" concerning the Security Instrument in my wallet, can ALSO be realized/created WITHOUT my signature. \n\nAn accountant for example, can magically “create” a negative amount of money by registering a NEW ACCOUNT in a ledger, and by identifying the SECURITY INTEREST I have in my pocket/wallet, they are investing in a gamble that I will be willing to become the SURETY for the NEGATIVE amount of money they created. They are hoping that I won’t choose to discharge/set-off the debt, and, that they can trick me into providing them with money of EXCHANGE. \n\nIf I don’t provide them either my signature (which accepts SURETY), or MONEY of EXCHANGE, the ACCOUNTANT who “signed off” on the ledger entry, and, or, the UNDERWRITERS who BONDED the actions of the PUBLIC SERVANT PERSON who \"signed off\" on the requisition/order to the accountant to make the entry, will surely be held ACCOUNTABLE. If the accountant entered/created a large enough negative number, AND they don’t get ME to act as SURETY for the PERSON they recently CREATED in their new ledger entry - jobs will be lost, vessels will be sunk, as  BONDS become LIQUIDATED to settle the account.\n\nAND, if I have been smart enough to follow Scott’s advice, and have previously liened the name of the SECURITY INTEREST in my pocket/wallet, the credit applied (and intended to balance out the account), is mine to claim and enjoy through the TRUST which is handled by my corporation. Once I claim it, they have to create/source even more money to settle the account.\n\nSuch a scenario therefore, serves not only my financial interests, but it also servers my AGENDA (and perhaps Scott’s agenda) in that it undermines every institution which chooses to operate and act in such a manner. It punishes them for their complicity in this global fraud.\n\n**************\n\nScott, I recall you saying something about half of all math and the number zero. Were you referring to the fact that in a ledger dealing with MONEY OF ACCOUNT, half of all the numbers entered will be negative (on one side of zero), while the other half of all numbers entered will be POSITIVE (on the other side of zero) in order to balance the books (get them to RETURN TO ZERO)? \n\nAm I way off track with this train of thought?

I refuse to GIVE him, because it is mine, and I do not want to enter into business relations with the police and / or collector of taxes, and / or creator of public debt, since no crime was committed on my part. \n\nHe decides to kidnap me and put me and put some chains on my wrists, and bring  me in a cage, and all the time I was in kidnapping  mode by him and his partners kidnappers, they absolutely wanted me me to  identify as a LEGAL PERSON, I categorically refused, and at this point, all I ask is the surety of the PERSON \n\nThe police and / or tax collector, and / or creator of public debt, claim that I am REQUIRED to cooperate, but the definition of cooperate says exactly the opposite, \n\ncooperate: \nAction method by which individuals or families with common interests is a business where the rights of all are equal and where the profit is distributed among the only partners in proportion to their participation in the associative activity. \n\nWho can force me to go into business with him / her? \n\nThe police and / or tax collector, and / or creator of public debts, tells me that not only will they violate my right to the surety of the person, but the JUDGE will do the same. \n\nIndeed, they were right, they carry me to the courthouse in St-Jerome, and in no time I could not make my right to the surety of the  person in this place, I was treated like a slave and that until I identify myself as a legal person, a stranger to even take the right to enter a plea of non-guilty for my person, which seems to me quite fraudulent, everything I wanted, is that you can point me where was the  surety of my person, so that we can generate $ 150,000.00 to provide a reasonable defense for my person, that is MY right, under Article 1 of the charter of Rights and freedoms of Quebec. \n\nI spent more than 32 hours in captivity, and I had no choice but to identify myself as a legal person and / or fictitious, and / or legal status in this place, yet it is a lie, and it is cLEARLY written in the Charter of rights and Freedoms of Quebec. \n\nCHAPTER I \nFUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS \n\nEvery human being has the right to life, as the surety, integrity and liberty of His person. \nIt also posesses legal personality. \n\npossession: \n1.

It doesn't have to honor those treaties any longer for the simple fact that the decendent of the signers have all been assimilated and integrated.  Meaning there are no longer any people who can reserve treaty rights.  You are a Canadian citizen first and a signatory treaty person second.  So the group or race of people who can reserve treaty rights technically don't exist.  They have been assimilated by joinder thru birth certificate and if there was any wiggle room the Indian act was created to flush it out.

They say even though I have photographic evidence snow was blown from the street to the private ways all the way along the property and they are the only ones with a contract to remove the snow from that street, there's no proof they did it.\n\nNow the municipality claims no responsibility whatsoever, and that any claim should be handled though the small claims court vs their contractor...\n\nI never contracted with those mofos, nor was ME or the PERSON ever informed that the municipality hired a contractor for that...\n\nApparently, there's a letter in the mail officially saying they don't give a shit, which they say they sent yesterday... Good to hear there will be one more proof of their dishonour and/or breach of public trust in my records...\n\nObviously, I have no fuckin intention of taking this to small courts. there's no contract between the PERSON and the municipality's contractor, the municipality is the party which must honour the public contract they have with their citizens, they received the notice and the invoice and never rebutted any of those 2.\n\nWould this be enough to go ahead and lien the fuckers ?\nShould I lien them using the PERSON I have ? I still don't have a PERSON I can trust.\nShould I meet a justice to explain everything before moving fwd with this ?\n\nThere's the municipality, then there's a bank in my scope... I wanna make sure I don't take a bite at something I cannot chew...\n\nScott ? Gail ? Beverly ? Anyone else has any input on this ?

Here in reality there have been many attempts to define it.  Law is just a weasel-word catch-phrase.\n\nThe works of Lord Lloyd of Hampstead, most notably “Introduction to Jurisprudence”, poses the question whether it's possible, or desirable to define LAW.  By 1972, when these works were written, there was no accepted definition.  There are, however, “proposed” definitions.  \n\nOne definition is that “LAW” is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour.  \n\nQueen's Counsel, Glenville Williams, said the meaning of the word law depends on the context in which the word is used.  For example, early Customary law and Municipal law are contexts where the word “LAW” have conflicting and irreconcilable meanings.  A devout Muslim will consider the Q'uran and the Hadiths LAW; however a quick examination of these “LAWS” will show that they're incompatible with anything resembling a civilized society.  \n\nIn the end a conclusion is that LAW is anything that's written down and upheld by the adherents of that writing.  It is the first MAXIM of LAW;”If it is written, it is Law.”  It simply boils down to how many people are willing to enforce it.\n\nSome “LAWS” are considered universal.  Don't harm others.  Don't steal from others; and don't deceive others.  Left at that point, the concept of LAW would be pretty simple, as these are things that most of us do as a matter of course.  \n\nIf you are taking the time to read this article, I think it's a safe assumption that you aren't doing it between bouts of robbery and murder.  Human beings, by their very nature (with some notable exceptions), are inherently altruistic, and have empathy; thus making the whole not killing people, not robbing people and not defrauding people, the de facto state of the average Homo sapien.  \n\nThese universal laws are essentially all Homo sapiens need to interact with each other.  If you're not killing somebody, and you're not robbing somebody, and you're not deceiving somebody, it is safe to presume that whatever you do is, in fact, LAWFUL.  \n\nSo what does LEGAL mean?\n\nIn Western society LEGAL means Acts and Statutes enacted by Parliament/Congress with the FORCE OF LAW, and with the consent of the governed.\n\nI created THE TENDER FOR LAW to educate the general public as to what money is; and the reason this is so important is that money is what indicates your consent to be governed by LEGAL Acts and Statutes.  \n\nIf you are unfortunate enough to know a banker or a lawyer, great entertainment can be had by asking the question, “What does this note is LEGAL Tender mean?”, and watching them trying to sputter out an answer.  Lawyers will give long, convoluted explanations with bullshit piled on top of bullshit.  When they are finished with their deliberately wrong answer, point to the words and ask, “Which word says all that? Is it the words, “this note”?  No?  What about the words, LEGAL Tender?  What does that mean?”  That is why this group is called THE TENDER FOR LAW.  \n\nTHIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER = THIS NOTE IS A TENDER FOR LAW.  \n\nIf you partake in any financial transaction, LEGALLY the only consideration is who must pay.  \n\nLEGAL = Accounting and Surety\n\nSurety simply means “responsible party”.  \n\nNone of this is ever taught to you in school, and as the Money as Debt series has taught you, neither is monetary theory.  This is done with a very insidious intent.  To understand what this insidious intent is, I must explain how I managed to avoid it.\n\nTo do this I must snap back to a childhood vignette.  \n\nMany readers will know the familiar feeling of having contempt for your parents.  Allow me to give you a few more.  My father (John Wayne Duncan), was in his mid-twenties and living in Belleville, Ontario.  He had moved there from London, Ontario, to take a job with Canadian National Railways.  We lived at 67 Village Drive, and my phone number was 962-0377.  I remember these salient details because they were hammered into my head, in case I was found wandering around, which I tended to do.  My grandmother (Olga Jean Duncan), thought I was the greatest thing that had ever blessed the earth; and whenever she was around my whims were catered to, in excess.  From that time forward, she was never shy about stating that “I was the favourite!”  From a child's perspective, comparatively, my parents seemed to actually resent my existence.  At that point in life, I had adopted several axioms which hold true to this day.\n\nIf you are under 20 years old, like it or not, you are a child. If you're fortunate enough to be this age, let me give you these axioms, and I guarantee your life will be of higher quality.  Notice I call them axioms, and not laws (although since I'm writing them down here, for this article, technically they are); \n\n1. EVERY ADULT IS LYING TO YOU – There are no exceptions to this rule.  Most lie because they don't want to admit they are ignorant of the questions you're asking them. Many lie because they don't want you to know certain things.  But in the end, they are all lying to you.  A lie of omission is still a lie.  It's intent is to deceive.  I think I covered that earlier in this article – see unlawful.\n\n2. IF YOU POINT OUT TO THESE ADULTS THAT THEY ARE, IN FACT, LYING TO YOU, THEY WILL INTENTIONALLY SEEK TO HARM YOU – There are no exceptions to this rule. Nobody's feelings are more hurt than when their lies are exposed.  You may think this sounds hostile, but that's simply because you can't tell the difference between what's true, and what feels good.\n\nBack to the childhood vignette...\n\nOne day my father vetoed a purchase that my grandmother had made, saying, “He needs to know the value of money.”  Unfortunately for all parties involved, I was at the stage in my intellectual evolution where I had reached the conclusion that the only way to successfully navigate the world of liars, which I appeared to have been born into, was to lie to them.  I mastered the art of deception at a very early age; and as long as you focus on the fact that the deception is there to misdirect, you can still see the world very clearly.  For one of the other advantages I had at that point, was that I knew that knowledge is power.  The trick is not to let anyone know you're learning it.\n\nWhen my grandmother agreed with my father's position, I was shocked and hurt, until I remembered, “They're all lying to me”.  My only question is, “Why are they all lying to me”?  It was shortly after that point that I learned I wasn't criminally accountable for my actions.  Wait...what were those words?  CRIMINALLY ACCOUNTABLE.  What the hell does CRIME have to do with ACCOUNTING?  I had just spotted a trinity.  Money, crime, accounting.\n\nWhenever I spotted interactive trinities I studied each part, knowing they were connected to the other two parts.  I dedicated the next two years, with the limited resources that I had, to the study of these things. I knew NEVER to reveal that I was actually thinking, because I saw what happened to kids that were discovered doing that. That's when I discovered what money actually was.\n\nAt that time I was attending Parkdale Public School.  In those early days (Late 70's), “Truancy” was considered an offence; but it turns out that nobody in a public library cares about truancy.  The librarians at the Belleville Public Library, seeing me reference but never checking out books, constantly checking references, looking up definitions of words, and reading law, simply saw me as a smart, ambitious young man who's “really going to go places when he grows up\".   The lesson I hadn't learned at that time was NEVER LET THEM TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.  \n\nHere's my example.\n\nSince my father was a Civil Engineer, designing a “dream house” and building it across town, was a matter of simplicity.  That house had been constructed, and we were living there.  By that point I was a little terror, because somehow this man had convinced my grandmother that “learning the value of money” was important.  When I stated that it had no value, and was in fact debt, I found myself in a permanently hostile environment. By that time my brother and sister had been born, because my father was figuring out that he'd married a worthless bimbo, and said worthless bimbo loved babies, but couldn't stand children.  When it looked like my father was going to call it quits, she invariably got “knocked-up”.  My sister was an exact clone of her mother; and I didn't know it at a time, but my brother would grow up to be one of the bravest men I had ever known.  Sadly, I got all the brains. Many things were denied me, because I dared declare that \"money has no value\".\n\nAll I ever heard about was how they didn't have any money.  But I knew money was worthless, and it bound you to a whole bunch of rules that nobody in their right mind would want.  I continued ignoring school and studying what was interesting to me; nobody had caught on to the library scam yet.  Nobody knew where I went during the day when I was “truant”, and since I was a child who didn't know counter-surveillance techniques, I was unaware that my mother had commissioned a neighbour's kid to follow me.  The little droplets of knowledge that I had, ended when the police showed up and terrorized the librarians.  I was brought home, the police commented on what a smart kid I was, and in the preparation for some form of corporal punishment that my mother had thought up, I pointed out that injuring me is a crime, but if I injured her, it was not.  I told her I would never forgive her for what she had taken away, and that if she ever denied me any knowledge ever again, I would kill her...\n\n...and then I went back to playing dumb.\n\nFor the first time in my life, everyone thought my mother was lying.  To this day, it is my fondest childhood memory. Nobody would accept that I could put these concepts together. I got my first erection when I saw fear in her eyes.  I was flooded with a flurry of emotion.  Nobody believed her.  Everything she was saying was true, and nobody believed her. They believed ME. I was just a dumb rebellious child, not someone who'd figured out things, far too soon for their liking.\n\nFrom the perspective of an adult it's pretty easy to play “dumb kid” as the adults in question, had forgotten what it's like to be a child, and had certainly forgotten how much their parents underestimated them.  \n\nNobody believed her.  Why didn't anyone believe her?  She was an adult.  That's when I realized I didn't need a library, I had a laboratory.\n\nBe offensive, deceptive, and stupid – because that's what they expected; which means they were always looking in the wrong direction.  I studied that trinity.  I studied law, I studied crime, and I studied money, because I was “not criminally accountable for my actions.”  \n\nAs I was going down this path to enlightenment, there was a disproportionate air of concern from my grandmother.  I wouldn't find out until I was thirteen exactly what that was.  At the time it was just, if you keep doing what you're doing, apparently you're going to miss out on something.  Something very important.  But when pressed on the issue, every party would lie about it.  By that point I could spot liars from a mile away.  Sometimes I couldn't spot what the lie was, I could simply spot that when they said something that they knew wasn't true, they couldn't hide it from me.  I learned more from people's lies than I ever did from honesty.  I resented my parents for this.  Why would they bring me into this world, filled with deception and lies, where everyone thinks wrong, and values the wrong things?\n\nI knew the value of money.  It had none.  And I also found that it had conditions – see THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER.  \n\nThose of you seeking liberty must learn law and accounting, because if you don't you will believe a million lies.  We've often heard the phrase, “No one is above the law\"!  In reality, there are lots of people above the law.  A Justice, for example, in Canada, has absolutely no criminal liability for their actions; yet you are told we are all equal under the law.  And you'll be told that it's necessary, etc., in order to distract you from the actual mechanics.  \n\nIf someone is “above the law”, then there is no law. It's fraud. A man/woman in a black dress and a red sash doesn't have magical super-powers that puts him/her “above the law” or above you; and these people possess no mental powers that you don't; yet everyone blindly accepts their “authority”. Thank your early childhood programming, and ESPECIALLY religion. It is your early programming that makes you \"believe\" people are \"above\" you.\n\nLegally, \"authority\" simply refers to the author of a document.  You'll find many of these contrary definitions throughout legal jurisprudence. These are hidden-in-plain-sight lies that everyone BELIVES.  So if you're a young man, or woman reading this, and you want the answer to all the questions you may have about life, start with a foundation of ALL BELIEF IS EVIL.\n\nIf you BELIEVE something, it means you've stopped investigating, or questioning it.  It means any research or thought you had once intended to put into it – has ended.\n\nBelief is the end of thought.  Those that believe, know this.  I can guarantee, despite the fact that you, the reader, are just one of seven billion people on this planet, you have at least once in your life heard the phrase, “You think too much”.\n\nTake a moment and try and recall who told you that; and then you can tell me why all belief is evil. \n\nFor those digging up records, the dream house my father built was at 84 Edgehill Road, Belleville, Ontario.  I used to attend Harry J. Clarke Public School,  and regularly robbed Moira Secondary School for items and materials needed for my actual education, not the public fool system.  Those doing serious digging, will see me as “Scott Duncan”, in yearbooks and records, etc. \n\nBecause I love giving away the ending of the story at the beginning, I will tell you right now that John Scott Duncan was my legal name, but it was also a TITLE, and therefore could not be used whilst I was a child in commerce. This \"TITLE\" is not something everyone gets, and it must be CLAIMED, and the claimant must be \"worthy\". There is a reason you are referred to as MASTER as opposed to MISTER when you are a child.  We'll cover that, and a bunch of shit attached to that, in a future article. It turned out for ME, that my name, itself, had a different standing legally.  All this knowledge I had as a child.  Now you are getting it; and you didn't even have to work for it.\n\nLet's snap back to the present again.\n\nAt this writing, the year is 2014 of what is generally known as the Common Era.  It used to mean Anno Domini, which apparently referred to a rape-baby that had a bad weekend for your “sins” (He didn't \"die\", according to the evil fairy tale. He \"came back to life\").  Let me take a second and do my regular bout of Christian-bashing and point out that if you're Christian your ideology is based on what is allegedly the word of a man who declared “Thou shalt not commit adultery”, and then went on to knock-up some other guy's wife in her sleep; which has the added bonus of being rape.  If you're a Christian, you won't understand why I think you're just an evil piece-of-shit.\n\nAll belief is evil.  Christian belief is particularly bad.\n\nSay what you want about Muslims, but their beliefs are based on the teachings of someone that actually existed.  \n\n...but I digress...\n\nAll belief is evil.  I've simply mastered the art of showing you why.  \n\nThe founders of the United States actually formed their Republic to escape the “money as debt” system.  They failed.  At this writing there is over a trillion dollar Trade Deficit, and this once-free Republic that was the bastion of invention, innovation and productivity is now just a nation of debt, and the enforcement thereof.  Virtually half the employed Americans today directly or indirectly work for the government, doing nothing but creating and enforcing policy.  Canada is not far behind.\n\nLook at where the United States was twenty years ago, and that's where Canada is now.\n\nI seem to have entered a period of my life where those in my past, who said I was crazy, are now coming back and saying, “You were right”!  \n\nVerily I say to those that knew me in the past, who are now coming out of the woodwork seeking answers from me; stop now, because \"I'm sorry\" isn't good enough any more. I already spent the time trying to teach you; TIME I WILL NOT GET BACK, and you couldn't be bothered to listen. If you make the attempt, I WILL harm you.  Consider that PROPER NOTICE and govern yourselves accordingly.  You're lucky you are even getting this. Be grateful. (Because I don't get that time back, you will PAY me first. Not with fiat currency, but in labour. HARD labour. A navy doesn't maintain itself, and there is a LOT of nasty/dangerous shit to do on a boat, that is just perfect for someone who dared waste my precious time!)\n\nBecause as I said before, I don't possess any mental powers you don't; and if you couldn't be bothered to listen the first time, then you have already chosen your side.  In the end, war is coming, and it will be a war between “thinkers” and “believers”, not good and evil.  To quote Ben Stiller in Zero Effect, \"There aren't any good guys.  You realize that don't you?  I mean you realize there aren't evil guys, and innocent guys. \nIt's just, it's just...it's just a bunch of guys.\"\n\nThinking and believing are mutually exclusive.  They shall forever be in conflict.  All that is “legal” relies on belief.  Legal has nothing to do with right and wrong.  It always has to do with money.\n\nREMEMBER THE REQUIRED VIEWING\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3P7izAUe3ZM "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_689592594410009","body":"Hydro-Quebec decided to CUT PIERRE DAOUST's electricity service, this morning at 10:00am.\n\nNow, how does little Pete will handle this ? :D "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_714948731874395","body":"We're being blocked by FB ... pls acknowledge if this comment is posted.

I have to tell you, it's not going to let up in this article, because this article is about INSURANCE.  We all know about INSURANCE.  If you're driving, you HAVE to have INSURANCE.  Hell if you want safe harbour anywhere, the harbour-master will demand that your boat have INSURANCE.\n\nSo let's look at the word.  First the prefix \"in\".  What does the prefix \"in\" mean?  Well, look at all the words that I use to describe all of you - Inept, incompetent, incapable, insecure, insincere, indefensible, inexcusable, ineffective...I'm sure you guys are getting the idea.  And the rest of the word just refers to surety.  In the end it all refers to surety and accounting -- nothing else.\n\nIn order to completely remove surety (insure), another PERSON must take responsibility (SURETY) for your actions.  This concept is in fact, FRAUD.  Here in reality it's not what you know, it's what you can prove.  I've leveraged that concept all my life.  Let's assume as I type this, I KNOW I am responsible for at least three homicides; but can you prove it?  Let's say you could.  What if you decided I committed those homicides for the right reasons, and you decided that you were going to \"do the time\" for me.  And while I certainly don't want to discourage people from doing really nice things for me, you serving the sentence for me does not actually absolve me of the responsibility.  You're just taking the proverbial \"hit\" for me.  Allowing you to do that time for me would be unethical in ways I won't even cover here, yet that morally repugnant concept is played out daily - with INSURANCE.\n\nAnother PERSON assumes SURETY for your actions.  This is why INSURANCE companies still refer to natural events/disasters as \"Acts of God\".  A delusional Christian fuck-wit brings this up weekly as though their INSURANCE policy validates the existence of God.\n\nThis is one of many uses for the Abrahamic religions.  They socially-engineer concepts like INSURANCE so they are elevated from blatant unethical FRAUD to a necessity for daily life, and they will say you are foolish, or a bad person, for not having INSURANCE.\n\nHow did they manage to pull that off?  In my above homicide scenario, I explained the FRAUD in plain, unambiguous terms.  Only the most ethically bankrupt amongst you will miss the point.  The reason it has never occurred to you, is because of everybody's favourite zombie-rape-baby, Jesus H. Christ.  \n\nAs a little side note to Christians, as it may not have occurred to them, it's NOT OK to impregnate women in their sleep!  This should seem obvious but you're a Christian -- so you can never be too sure.\n\nAnyway...where was I? ...Jesus the zombie-rape-baby...right.\n\nThe whole Christian doctrine revolves around the assertion that Jesus-zombie-rape-baby died for your sins.  Only Christians seem to be able to determine what these \"sins\" are; however, apparently having sex is a sin, and murder is a sin; hell, even thought crimes (impure thoughts) are sins.  But don't you worry, you horrible, wretched thing, Jesus the zombie-rape-baby has died for your sins.  And if you can believe that, well then, Bob's Universal All-encompassing mega INSURANCE policy (don't forget to read the fine print) is for you (Act now, 'cause you know we can't do this all day)!  \n\nOne of the things all of you have to realize, especially the Christians, is that the entire history of the world was rewritten in the 1500's.  Shakespeare was introduced to inject \"legalese\" into the vernacular of the Angols.  Translate any copy of THE MAGNA CARTA and you will notice no legalese ever appears in it.  And my personal favourite is Christians that wave around the KING JAMES BIBLE.  I can't make this any simpler.  It says right on the fucking cover who is scamming you!  \n\nEverything in the nobility is executed by APPOINTMENT, from social engineering projects like the KING JAMES BIBLE, to Dunhill cigarettes, because the Queen likes a certain type of tobacco.  These products and \"services\" are executed with the presumption that they are in compliance with the Sovereign's wishes, and notice is given on the product itself that it was created by APPOINTMENT, by the entity who appointed it.\n\nThe KING JAMES BIBLE was APPOINTED by King James.  The technology had reached the point were mass production of print medium was possible.  This meant that social engineering that normally relied on \"word-of-mouth\" could now have rigid change-control introduced.  This meant the instructions for selling your daughter into slavery was consistent throughout the Commonwealth.  This also introduced the concept of an imaginary rape baby taking responsibility for all the bad shit you do.  Seriously that's what you \"bought\".  There are people reading this who believe this to be true.  \n\nThe whole \"dying\" thing is also a scam.  That's the zombie part.  Zombie-rape-baby-Jesus supposedly came back to life three day's after he died.  Where's the sacrifice?  He wasn't even out of commission long enough for his relatives to start fighting over his stuff.  The very notion that \"Jesus died for your sins\" is nullified by the fact that he stopped being dead.  He didn't die for your sins, he had a bad weekend for your sins...and he slept through most of it.  OK, I'm really Christian-bashing here.  Let's split the difference and say, \"Jesus was sightly inconvenienced for your sins.\"\n\nI understand he was inconvenienced on a long weekend, too, which makes it really...bad?\n\nI'm sorry, I'm really trying to ascertain how this equals all the bad shit you do.  You Christians will claim this Jesus guy will absolve me of any wrongdoing because of the \"sacrifice\" he made, but I'm not seeing where this sacrifice is.  I'm not mentioning this because I'm looking for convincing.  I'm from that same group of guys that made this book, and that's where the argument becomes moot.  \n\nI can't stress this enough, but I'm one of the guys that's in on the scam.\n\nYou'll constantly hear me say, \"Stop studying the clubhouse rules, because you're not in the club.\"  I'm descended from the founders of the club.  I would rather live in poverty than to live off your labour; although my position on this has been on a sliding scale of late.  Of all the clubhouse rules, the bible in any form, should be avoided at all costs.  It should be fought at every possible opportunity, and should be met with all the ridicule and contempt you can throw at it...\n\n...because it deserves no less.  It is an ethically bankrupt FRAUD...just like INSURANCE.\n\nIf you think I can make Christianity sound retarded, wait until I cover INSURANCE.  \n\nSo let's zoom back to when you were 16-years-old.  You can't vote, you can't drink, there's a question mark as to whether you can legally have sex according to where you reside, but there is one thing you can do -- you can drive.\n\nHence you engage in the ego-building act of getting \"permission to learn\" from the government.  So, at the whim of a paper-pusher who couldn't get a job in the real world, you will hopefully be given permission to learn; and you will have proof that you have this permission when you produce a LEARNER'S PERMIT.  And so every good Christian goes through this RIGHT OF PASSAGE where they are granted permission to learn.  Gee willikers, it's awfully swell that the government gave you permission to learn, huh?\n\nBut you're just sixteen, remember?  You're not old enough to know of the real pitfalls of life...like dames and broads trying to play you for a sap (I'm laughing as I type this, because 1950's movie-speak is almost as retarded as this generations's pop-culture slang).  \n\nNow in order to exercise your newly-acquired \"permission to learn\" you're going to need a vehicle, perhaps a car, which is a contraction of carriage...which is a LEGAL term, so don't use it.  But since you're trying to be \"LEGAL\", having been granted \"permission to learn\" (seriously am I the only one who finds that the most demeaning thing ever written on paper?), a car will do just nicely.  But what if you get into an accident?  It won't occur to you that accident is just that - an accident.  There is no SURETY, real or implied, for something that's accidental.  That's what makes it an accident!  There is no intent behind the damage.  But if you subjugate yourself to a PERSON, that PERSON will assume full SURETY for any damages, and like zombie-rape-baby-Jesus, this PERSON only exists on paper.  All of you consider it so real, that people are jailed regularly for \"Driving without INSURANCE\".  It sort of \"drives\" the point home, doesn't it?\n\nYou have been pre-programmed to accept this subjugation, this ridiculous, FRAUDULENT, morally-bankrupt subjugation is a LEGAL necessity, and all of it deals with MONEY OF ACCOUNT.  MONEY OF EXCHANGE never touches the equation.  For those of you who are too lazy and/or stupid to learn the difference between MONEY OF ACCOUNT and MONEY OF EXCHANGE, one dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT is only capable of buying and/or cancelling another dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT.  90% of all money in the world is this type of money.  It's pretend.  It's not real.  It only applies to the clubhouse rules, and it competes directly with the money in your pocket.  This is the dynamic that everyone misses.  \n\nI hear lots of extremely accurate descriptions of how MONEY OF ACCOUNT is created, and they all come from idiots who know nothing about what money is.  They'll go off on some tangent about Lou Manotti and his evil henchmen, the Freemasons.  ...and lizards. There's lizards somewhere in all of their crap, too.\n\nOnce again I'd like to digress and remind everyone that on every occasion that I required a mason, free did not enter into the equation.  Masons are fucking expensive, and there's no such thing as a free one.\n\n...where was i?\n\nAh yes...MONEY OF ACCOUNT versus MONEY OF EXCHANGE.\n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW is primarily about the money that carries that TENDER.  There are lots of learned men who will talk endlessly about law.  I have forgotten more about law than all of these men combined have ever learned.  I say men because a woman's brain simply would not be able to encompass the blatant lies that the travesty that we call law spews at them.  Reading the writings of Mary Elizabeth Croft will provide you with one example of what goes through a thinking-woman's mind when law is actually analyzed.  You'll notice the things I teach you here from a law perspective, are really simple.  They are all created with the intent of getting you out of accounting and surety.  I have declared publicly on the record that the TENDER FOR LAW that money provides is, in fact, a FRAUD.  Most of you reading this are probably already painfully aware of this fact.\n\nMy entire life plan relied on the RULE OF LAW remaining intact, but when the time came for me to assert my RIGHTS under that rule, the pretence became blatant.  Anyone else going through what I have, would have been defeated; but as I constantly point out, I'm descended from an evil, vile, pseudo-culture...and I've forgotten more about law than any of these people will ever know.  There are lawyers that will testify to that fact, so it's not like this should come as a surprise, but I have documented EVERYTHING.  If it was spoken as regards me, I have a recording of it.  If any name over which I have executive authority has been used in a document, I have a copy of it.  Laid out on a time-line, the blatant FRAUD becomes irrefutable, conclusive proof of what everybody already knows.  \n\nI mention all this because what I'm describing is, INSURANCE.  Notice that my INSURANCE is a little different than the good neighbours at, \"State Farm\".  It's designed to put the SURETY where it belongs -- not with me.  The difference between the good neighbours at State Farm and me, is that I am not subjugating myself.  My INSURANCE is real.  It exists in the real world, and the more astute among you will see that I am pushing it all into a universe of virtual worlds.\n\nWhen you understand what money is, you can construct money through VALUE.\n\nIf it exists in the real world, it has VALUE.  Any currency used to track that VALUE, when exchanging goods, is MONEY OF EXCHANGE.  \n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, does not exist in the real world.  Only its mysterious creators have any COPYHOLD on the VALUE.  That's the thing about Bitcoin - in the end the guys that created it, get all the money.  They get this because people volunteer to take alpha-test-grade, proof-of-concept code, and open their computers up to the Internet.  They then give hardware-level access to their memory, processor, GPU and hard drive, to a rogue, autonomous process that their empty, little heads couldn't even dream of understanding, with no one paying attention to its original intent -- which is to prove that it could be done.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, there are people who are doing this on purpose, because the VALUE is returned almost immediately.  For Bitcoin has all the properties of gold, without the liabilities.  Bitcoin is but one cryptographic currency.  AQUILAE has its own cryptographic currency.  It cannot be counterfeited, and is a near-perfect accounting mechanism.  AQUILAE is not even a PERSON, it's a TRUST.  If a TRUST can have a currency, why can't you?  What I am building for everyone here, is a method to remove the middle-man.  If you have your own currency, you don't need a bank.  If cryptographic currencies can't be counterfeited, then it's trade cannot be regulated.  It remains within the private realm and the ease at which you can convert your currency to MONEY OF EXCHANGE anywhere in the world, is directly proportional to your VALUE.  In the current economic framework, backed by debt-based FIAT currency, the only legitimate path to wealth is to produce, to make something in the real world that didn't exist before.  \n\nLike every dollar in existence, all things of VALUE have a creation date and a death date.  Whatever you produce must be built with that in mind.  For instance, producing a plaque with a cheesy-Jesus slogan on it, actually has VALUE.  Perhaps it has VALUE to its creator, but here in reality, that plaque with the cheesy-Jesus slogan, will find its way to a landfill very quickly.\n\nThis very article you are reading has a creation date, and a death date, and this is becoming apparent with the four threads that just magically disappeared here.  Pierre destroyed the thread where he was bestowed his sacred, native name.  The thread itself had VALUE, for it reflected the culture from whence Pierre came.  The colloquial term, \"fucking the dog\" refers to bored, unionized workers taking their one-hour breaks between their fifteen minutes of actual labour.  Look at any road crew in Quebec and you will see a working example of \"fucking the dog.\"  And so, Fucks the Puppy was bestowed upon Pierre as an homage, and in an irrational fit of nameless rage Pierre destroyed the thread, which by the way, is the most labour I've ever seen out of labourer in Quebec.  Ok, I don't really feel that way about people from Quebec.  Don't quote me on it, but I'm pretty sure there's an act or statute somewhere in Ontario that says I must make fun of people from Quebec.  I'm also pretty sure there's an equivalent act or statute for people in Quebec to refer to people in Ontario.  Truth be told, one of the most inspirational people in my lifetime was Rene Levesque, and I strongly suggest that every single reader look at the history of this awesome shit-disturber.  \n\nQuebec politicians do some awesome things.  For example, if you want to see awesome, political suicide, no one will ever beat Jacques Parizeau...but I digress again...\n\nWe were talking about INSURANCE.\n\nMy INSURANCE is my life plan.  It's way off track, and I need to get it back on track.  But my life plan relied on the Rule of Law remaining intact.  And while we weren't looking, our RIGHTS got sold, and nobody bothered consulting us.  My INSURANCE company went bust.  The Rule of Law is not intact, and in my eyes they have forfeitted the right to exist; because I've made it very clear, that limited liability is a fallacious concept, and if I stand by and watch the GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO operating as \"JUSTICE\", victimize the PUBLIC whose TRUST it holds, I become no better than you.  I have a life plan that I must return to.  I have a defective government process posing as \"JUSTICE\" and victimizing the citizens it has sworn to serve.  \n\nTo return to my life plan under these circumstances is to make myself an enabler; and so I have a problem.  For whether I like it or not, I'm one of the good guys, and it's not a role I'm comfortable with.  There are many reasons for this, one of them being that to be the good guy, I have to do both.  I have to get \"a\" Rule of Law in place, one that serves the interests of the people it governs.  Since I love spewing out spoilers I'm going to give the end of the story away RIGHT NOW!  Why am I destroying your journey of discovery by giving away the ending? Because, FUCK YOU, that's why!  I may be the good guy, but I don't have to be nice about it.\n\nThe only way to LEGALLY and LAWFULLY do what I propose is to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to the Monarchy for a period not exceeding five years.  From this moment forward a primary focus of those who follow what I am teaching should be an investigation into why this is true.  It is the only possible answer that has any chance of success.  Over the next few weeks we will explore why giving executive power to a little old lady of Germanic descent, and nine Corgees, is a good idea.  AND, because I'm right, everybody is going to find out the hard way, that it is impossible to prove that I'm wrong.  That's what makes it right!  \n\nAs I explain, step-by-step, how I intend to accomplish this lofty goal, it will become readily apparent that I already have everything in place.  I've planned for what's to come.  AND, before shit gets real, I'm going to train you all up to a level where you can think in a useful manner.  By useful, I mean to YOU, because you currently think wrong, and VALUE the wrong things.  It may be difficult to hear, but you're programmed to be a useless, sack-of-shit.  If you should produce any VALUE, the government is there to lie to you about that VALUE, and to trick you into thinking you owE THEM for being VALUEable.  If I'm successful, all that stolen VALUE will be returned to the people it was stolen from.  But what happens at the end of that five years? You see Elizabeth Windsor is the KEEPER OF THE TRUST.  You see a little, old lady.  I see an echo of a little girl that the world knew as Princess Elizabeth -- and her plea to the Commonweath to come to her aid.  This is the SOVEREIGN OF THE COMMONWEALTH, and she didn't choose it.  My grandfather taught me all I needed to know to TRUST Elizabeth Windsor.  When the power is handed to her, she'll know what to do with it, because she knows that even if she fails at what is surely a lifetime of planning, she has you and I, as INSURANCE.\n\nWhile this sinks in...

Once unimaginable surveillance technologies are being perfected and implemented. The most intimate details of lives are routinely and unthinkingly surrendered to data-gatherers. Is it still possible to be an anonymous whistleblower? Is it still possible to be anonymous at all? Your physical location and activities for the past ten years are known and have been logged. If you attend a church or synagogue or mosque or a demonstration or visit an abortion clinic or a \"known criminal activity location\" or meet with a \"targeted person\" or a disliked political activist, it is routinely recorded. Your finances, sexual orientation, religion, politics, habits, hobbies, and information on your friends and family are gathered, indexed, and analyzed. Facial recognition, camera analytics, license plate readers, and advances in biometrics allow you to be de-anonymized and remotely surveilled 24/7/365 by machines. Forensic linguistics, browser and machine fingerprinting, and backdoors substantially eliminate the possibility of anonymous Internet activity. Thanks to \"The Internet of Things,\" your thermostat and electric meter report when you arrive home and your garbage can reports when you throw out evidence to be collected by the few remaining human agents. \"Predictive profiling\" even knows what you will do and where you will go in the future, so the data collection bots can be waiting for you. Data collection now begins at birth. And no data gathered will ever be thrown away. And none of the data gathered belongs to you or will be under your control ever again. An internationally-known private investigator and longtime HOPE speaker, Steve will describe in frightening detail how the last shreds of everyone's anonymity are being ripped away. Real world examples will be used. Surprises can be expected.\n\nSpeakers: Steve Rambam [Steve Rambam is the founder and CEO of Pallorium, Inc. (http://www.pallorium.com), a licensed investigative agency with offices and affiliates worldwide. He has coordinated investigations in more than 50 countries and in nearly every U.S. state and Canadian province. Steve has conducted or coordinated numerous foreign insurance-related investigations, including hundreds of homicide and \"death claim\" investigations, and a significant number of these cases have resulted in confessions, arrests, and prosecutions. He is perhaps best publicly known for his pro bono activities, which have included the investigation of nearly 200 Nazi collaborators and war criminals in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia.

This is article number two in as many days!\n\nDerek Moran says that he finds it difficult to believe that I will be able to top the SURETY article...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.\n\nIt is almost midnight on Sunday, I'm on the bridge of the Tycho-Brahe, and as I look out onto the lake the water is like a sheet of glass...and it's not even frozen. How can I not produce a superior article tonight? So today, with all my \"God\" complex, \"arrogance\", and the knowledge that a host of \"pseudo radio\" is reading my superior work, and knowing that all he can do is tremble in impotent fury. Things are so good I can cover the bad aspects of law, namely its language.\n\nSome of you may have already started to figure this out, but every single word in a legal document is designed specifically for the purpose of trapping you. Even words like AND, OR, IS, MAY, SHOULD...all of these are traps! And law dictionaries use them perfectly. You may have noticed words like UNDERSTAND don't mean what you think they mean. This is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit in the legal world. What I am about to teach you here is the legalese equivalent of \"code breaking\".\n\nLet's jump back to the 1500's...\n\nThis is the time in our civilization that we often refer to as the Renaissance. The reason the Renaissance occurred is that whole shitloads of people were dying of various forms of plague, and rat-shit-covered scientists were baffled as to why this virulent disease was spreading everywhere.\n\nThe practical result of all this was that a whole shitload of people died, and the ones that made it, inherited all their possessions. Efforts to communicate more efficiently became a social priority, because there was lots to do to maintain all this new property, and not enough people to do it. For nearly 800 years \"God\" was everything, despite his demonstrable lack of assistance in this era. You see the age where \"God\" was everything was called the \"dark ages\". Every time I hear an adult with an \"imaginary friend\" talk about how \"ignorant and closed-minded\" I am, all I see is an individual that wishes to return to that horrible time.\n\nAs there were fewer people in the 1500's, and the Renaissance was just getting underway, inherited art was often used as currency. The next generation had a higher literacy rate than the previous, and so administrative rules were born. It doesn't take a \"Rocket Scientist\" to see how useful slipping Shakespeare in around the latter half of the 1500's would be to those few who don't actually do any work. The false profession of \"law\" was born.\n\nYou'll notice that nobody ever \"does\" law. They only \"practice\" it. They keep practising and practising, but they never quite get it right (that's what you get for not subscribing to the TENDER FOR LAW!).\n\nFrom the 1500's to the present, there has been an odd phenomenon regarding language. English is a Germanic language that merged with the language of the Angols (we will discuss the Angols and the Picts in another article). Germanic influence on the language of the Angols resulted in the English written in the MAGNA CARTA. But if you try to learn German today, you'll notice an interesting phenomenon. Though the words you use sound startlingly similar, and the really observant can actually pick out the words when German speak and get a general idea of what they're saying, even if they don't speak the language. Except further study shows that the Germans speak \"backwards\" grammatically. Jumping to the south-west, Spanish, a much simpler language, where every vowel is a syllable, and words say what they mean, but once again, \"grammatically backwards\". Head north-east in our mental European map...to France...well France is filled with French people so we needn't bother with them. Those French have a different word for everything, and their language is, you guessed it, \"grammatically backwards\".\n\nThose of you noticing the pattern here will not be using too much intellect when they start posing the question, \"Maybe we're the ones that are backwards\". And that is almost, but not quite true.\n\nLike a virus, legalese infected the English language. It's encouraged to this day to use legalese to appear \"smart\". This is done on purpose. It is an insidious piece of social engineering.\n\nThe want you to try to use these words without knowing what the little words mean.\n\nIT'S ALL ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS.\n\nWhen you read, you read from left to right on a page. The small words actually exclude part of the sentence. You will notice in my now famous, NOTICE OF MISTAKE, that I always use \"and/or\". I do this on purpose, because I like to keep my options open.\n\nMaxims of Law say it plainly. The inclusion of one thing excludes all others. The definition of a PERSON in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA is the most hysterical example of this. The definition of PERSON is hidden in the larger scope of \"every one\". The common law maxim, \"The INCLUSION of one is the exclusion of another\" means in the context of the CRIMINAL CODE INCLUDES \"Her Majesty\" AND an \"organization\". See for yourself:\n\n*** THE CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA***\n“every one”, “person” and “owner”\n\n« quiconque », « individu », « personne » et « propriétaire »\n\n“every one”, “person” and “owner”, and similar expressions, include Her Majesty and an organization;\n\n**********************************\n\nYou will find this by searching for R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 under the Interpretations Section.\n\nIn reality, what this says is that a \"PERSON\" is \"HER MAJESTY\". Unless you are \"HER MAJESTY\" people answering to these acts and statutes are simply \"performing these acts\" (remember Shakespeare) on \"HER MAJESTY's\" behalf, much like the GOVERNOR GENERAL PERFORMS royal duties on the Queen's behalf. This is why the GOVERNOR GENERAL is always a chosen CITIZEN, and not an elected official.\n\nThe GOVERNOR GENERAL ACTS as the Queen when the Queen is not in town. This of course has nothing to do with \"HER MAJESTY\".\n\nWhen dealing with the LAW, in CANADA anyway, you are always dealing with \"HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA\", which as we all know is a CORPORATE ORGANIZATION.\n\n\"OR\" means you have a choice, \"one\" OR the \"other\", but not BOTH.\n\nSo, in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA, a PERSON can be \"HER MAJESTY\". A PERSON can be \"HER MAJESTY\", but a PERSON must also be an \"ORGANIZATION\". Notice it does not say \"OR\" an organization in the above interpretation. Confused yet?\n\nThat happens in Legalese. Let's, instead of looking at this dry, depressing CRIMINAL CODE stuff, look at something happy, exciting and real.\n\nI can say with absolute certainty that no woman on the planet has loved me more than Tara. However, no amount of love would compel her to JOINDER herself to a \"BILL OF LADING\", and hand it over to the GOVERNMENT. That means \"getting married\" (for the stupid amongst you). I'm sorry if that sounds condescending (that means talking down to people).\n\nNow think about this marriage transaction. The marriage INCLUDES \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", not \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\". This means marriage makes you effectively ONE PERSON UNDER THE LAW. Since the marriage actually consists of THREE ENTITIES, \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", which by its nature EXCLUDES the GOVERNMENT, still remains an \"ORGANIZATION\". A marriage ORGANIZES these \"entities\" into their respective roles. If \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\" remain \"Scott AND Tara\", the GOVERNMENT HAS NO STANDING. However, if Tara sought a divorce, the MARRIED PERSON is no longer \"Scott AND Tara\", and the GOVERNMENT gets to intervene.\n\nThis most certainly wouldn't be the case if it was \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\". Therefore, the above CRIMINAL CODE definition of \"PERSON\" defines HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ***INSERT PROVINCE HERE***, which is both \"HER MAJESTY\" AND an \"ORGANIZATION\".\n\nEvery one who is CHARGED in CANADA is usually CHARGED by their PROVINCE. For instance, if I were to take the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD lawyer \"Heather\" and bash her skull into jelly with a ball-peen hammer (as she so richly deserves), I would likely be CHARGED with HOMICIDE in the JURISDICTION where I chose to do this \"skull-bashing\". As I'm a profoundly lazy man I probably wouldn't travel, so ONTARIO would be the JURISDICTION. This makes \"HER MAJESTY\" AND the \"ORGANIZATION\", \"HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO\". Since all ACTS and STATUTES fall to PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of \"HER MAJESTY\", this makes all PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of \"HER MAJESTY\" effectively \"HER MAJESTY\". HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO is in fact, an \"ORGANIZATION\". You now have the qualifications for a \"PERSON\" as defined in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA.\n\nJust as the \"marriage\" consists of \"Scott AND Tara\", which effectively creates an \"ORGANIZATION\", \"HER MAJESTY\" and the organization defined as \"IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO\" create a \"PERSON\" which YOU are presumed to be a PUBLIC SERVANT of. This effectively means all CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS are simply administrative processes for that \"ORGANIZATION\". The NOTICE OF MISTAKE effectively removes that presumption.\n\nYou now see how powerful the words \"and\" and \"or\" are. If AQUILAE says the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is \"Scott AND Tara\", this would mean neither of us individually could act as CAPTAIN, but \"Scott and Tara\" could BOTH be CAPTAIN. This means that all ORDERS from the CAPTAIN must come from BOTH Scott AND Tara. However, the AQUILAE TRUST is not a stupid document, and the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott OR Tara. This means that when Tara speaks, everyone shuts the fuck up...including me. It's Scott OR Tara - not BOTH!\n\n\"AND\" refers to BOTH. \"OR\" does not. This is why putting \"and/or\" gives you the options; and since the AQUILAE TRUST is pretty much perfect, here in reality, the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott and/or Tara.\n\nThis means I can ACT as CAPTAIN, Tara can ACT as CAPTAIN, and we can BOTH ACT as CAPTAIN. Recipients of this POLICY have NO STANDING to contest when we assume and/or drop the role of CAPTAIN. Why do we do this, you ask? Because FUCK OFF, THAT'S WHY! If you're even looking at the AQUILAE TRUST, you're a fucking TRUSTEE; and the only reason you should be looking at the AQUILAE TRUST is to find the best way to \"Shut the fuck up and do what you're told\" for Scott and/or Tara....\n\nAnd that is how you make a powerful LEGAL document with the words \"and/or\", and the reason why we write things this way. Use AND & OR to restrict other parties. Use BOTH (and/or) to free yourself.\n\nIf your document is stating the terms, make it as open as possible for YOU, and as restrictive as possible for every OTHER PARTY. If somebody is thought of as a \"good lawyer\", it means they have mastered this skill. Were I to be practising law, I would be a very, very good lawyer.\n\nOne of our loyal readers made the horrendous mistake of using different words, in another post. Instead of NOTICE OF MISTAKE he said, NOTICE OF \"ERROR\", which means something completely different. If you look up the legal definition of \"mistake\" you will notice amongst other things (inter alia) the legal definition of \"MISTAKE\" ends with \", or error\". If you are going to learn from the TENDER FOR LAW, you must always remember the Number 1 Rule of the Universe:\n\nSCOTT IS ALWAYS RIGHT!\n\nYou can save yourself a lot of time by NOT second-guessing Scott, and proceeding to figure out WHY Scott is right.\n\nThis also means that when I present a document you should presume it's perfect, and that changing it will fuck you over in ways you don't even understand. \"NOTICE OF ERROR\" is not \"NOTICE OF MISTAKE\". You don't change the document because you think it \"sounds cooler\". You don't change the document because you think another cooler-sounding word means the same thing; and I will always interpret such changes as TENDERING AN OFFER to amuse me, by allowing me to berate you for your stupidity, and to laugh at you when a court kicks your ass. This is a TENDER I will gladly ACCEPT and volunteer for, with the added bonus that I will execute my duties in this TENDER to the best of my abilities. I'm really good at that too.\n\nTaking what you have just learned here and reading through ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, will reveal some very interesting and insidious things. You're better off serving me as a slave, because unlike ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, I won't lie to you, and I'll tell you exactly what I mean.\n\nSo there you have it, AND & OR - two hidden keys to legalese and the knowledge that \"include also excludes\"...and before you ask EXCLUDES includes all that remains. Use EXCLUDE to get rid of everything else; use INCLUDE to restrict to a single point/item.\n\nThe guy with the fake \"charity\" seeking legal advice actually asked what TENDER means, and it occurs to me that those who AREN'T lying to me might wonder too. TENDER in the context of Law means, \"to present to PERSON, an unconditional offer, to enter into a contract\". Look at those words, then look at a bank note. THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER means, \"THIS NOTE IS AN UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW\". That is why the group name is so clever. This group is ABOUT that UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW. It's ALL money.\n\nMoney is JOINDER. JOINDER MAY (Read as: \"ALWAYS DOES\") INCLUDE SURETY!\n\nTHIS is the LEGALESE you need to know. NO MORE. Your ONLY goal should be to REMOVE and/or AVOID SURETY when dealing in commerce and/or LAW. WHEN YOU SIGN A CHEQUE, you are TENDERING SURETY. A BANK NOTE does NOT THENDER SURETY as the SURETY is signed for, by SOMEBODY ELSE.\n\n-Scott Duncan "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_695941043775164","body":"\"Toronto constitutional lawyer Rocco Galati said the blanket order shrouding the vast majority of investigations into complaints against judges is “an abuse and excess of power” and is an example of “judges protecting judges.” Galati...said allowing secrecy in the courts carries serious consequences.\n\n“In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have full swing,” he said, quoting 18th-century British jurist and philosopher Jeremy Bentham. “Where there is no publicity there is no justice.” Toronto judge upbraided for errors, still on the job | Toronto Star thestar.com A complaint about a repeatedly chastised Toronto judge sparked a lengthy investigation into his conduct before the matter was dealt with in secret and the case closed.

For the purposes of this article, there are no purported \"gurus\" in this forum, Christians believe they have an invisible companion, and money is a TENDER FOR LAW.  On a personal note, theists could, I suppose, park their imaginary friends at the door, but as the saying goes, \"If you believe that, you'll buy these shoes\".  That level of credulity, which by its very nature permeates every aspect of your existence, simply does not coexist well with critical thought.\n\nAlthough all of these things are connected, only one of these things interests me today - money as LEGAL TENDER.  I'm really confused as to why this concept seems so difficult to the average person.  Our lives revolve around the concept of tenders.  \n\nBasically, a tender is an offer that can be accepted or rejected.\n\nFrom childhood, we put out tenders for affection, acceptance, or stuff, to our parents and strangers, by being cute, or funny, or disingenous.  If the \"cuteness\" is accepted we may get affection, candy or a new bike.  In this system we are subject to the whims of these adults, their oversight and their rules.\n\nIn adulthood we continue to put out tenders for affection, financial or material gain, and even copulation.  Here too we have made the transition to bigger acceptance and better toys, and are now subject to larger oversight and different rules.\n\nIf someone \"offers\" you a flower on the street, you'd better believe it's a tender for pointless conversation or a \"charitable donation\".\n\nIf you're a woman sitting alone in a bar and someone sidles up to you and offers to buy you a drink, what you're really dealing with is a TENDER for SEX.  In this country at least, there are penalties for simply forcing yourself on another person.  You can, however, raise a tender with dinner, a drink, a fur coat, or a trip to Disneyland; and few people are ultimately confused at the expected outcome.\n\nWhy then should the concept of LEGAL TENDER be so obtuse?  Money is something you don't own, and didn't make.  In fact you can't make it - it's a closed system.  You can possess it or use it (see debt in transit), but only if you observe the terms and conditions set by others (not you again) for its use.  The fact that everyone uses and values it, doesn't make availing yourself of this luxury any less a tender.  If you \"owned\" the money you could set your own terms and conditions for its use.  As you don't, the terms and conditions are set by other controlling entities.  By using others' property you agree to be bound by certain rights and obligations - why else would you be participating in this system?  The use of institutionalized money benefits you when you colour inside the lines, and makes you accountable for non-performance when you don't.  There is, in fact, a fairly mature and far-reaching web of systems all working in concert to reward or punish depending on the profit you generate, and how well, or poorly, you perform.\n\nLet's look at a practical example.  If I have a car, and I let you use it, I might tell you that it must be returned in pristine condition, or with a full tank of gas.  Those are just some of the terms I might set.  I might tell you to pick up my aunt Flora at the doctor's office as well.  If you agree to the stipulations I have set, you can accept the loan of the car.  Let's say you forget to collect aunt Flora, and return the car on empty with garbage in the back seat.  I might be angry, I might want you to pay for cleaning the car, or I might send burly men to beat you up.  The only sure thing is that it's probably the last time I'll loan you the car.\n\nUsing conventional money has benefits, no doubt about it.  It's more convenient than working directly for food or shelter, and more socially acceptable than bringing a chicken or pig to exchange for a new outfit.  People have been conditioned to believe that money makes you happy, money buys everything you need, and money offers you legal protections that not-money never could.  \n\nIt's hard to solicit a tender for affection, and one drink may not be an adequate or enforceable tender for sex.  But money...different thing altogether.\n\nCaveat emptor - you'd better read the oh-so-tiny writing on every bill.  For money is a TENDER FOR LAW.

How come the original meaning of so many words we take for granted --for example understand meaning “To stand under the authority of the Church (Roman Cult)” are also deliberately hidden?\n\n    The answer is simple, “they” do not want you to know the true nature and meaning of the words you use every day without ever questioning what you are actually saying under “their” system from “person”, to “claim”, to “deposit” to even the word “law” itself.\n    The catch-22 of modern law and meaning of key words\n\n    A classic of why this system of deliberate hidding meaning is in place is in regards to the practical operation of local, national and international law.\n\n    Many a bright person who has studied law soon identify key words that have important power within the legal system--REGINA meaning \"The Crown\" is one such example. But unless an individual can demonstrate to the Court an understanding and precedence of the legal terms being used, the knowledge of key legal terms and ancient legal phrases are of little use.\n\n    But when an individual is capable of demonstrating a real understanding of words within a Court, then it is possible to shift the power almost immediately to your favour to some degree.\n    The intention of this lexica\n\n    The intention therefore of this lexica is to provide an insight into some of the important legal words of power and control used by modern governments pledging alliance to the present legal system of the Holy See, the “common law” that threads its web throughout almost every single nation on Earth.\n\n    By understanding the original meaning and intention of these words, it is hoped you will better understand the implications of many of the documents and actions you take for granted on a daily basis.\n\n    A\n    B\n    C\n    D\n    E\n    F\n    G\n    H\n    I\n    J\n    K\n    L\n    M\n    N\n    O\n    P\n    Q\n    R\n    S\n    T\n    U\n    V\n    W\n    X\n    Y\n One-Heaven: Lexica Dei Divinus one-heaven.org We depend on words.

I'd much rather be torn apart  and spit out here than in court. The matter involves a trustee in Bankruptcy... BDO who has sent me an \"offer\" to settle what they deem \"an undervalue transaction\" when I transferred the title of my family home back to myself as sole title 6months before my wife claimed bankruptcy. Not my choice or descision for her to do that, but thats what she went with. My initial verbal response to the trustee was that  except for a brief period of 1.5 years. When my wife was added she was added for the consideration of one dollar as was the case when title was returned to me, the same consideration. They are \"offering\" to allow me to pay them 14,000.00 as an out of court settlement based on what they say her consideration should have been. We are, still married. She has signed an affidavit stating she has no matrimonial interest in the property. I drafted a letter. My first thought was to respond aggressively declining their offer to contract and including my fee schedule for any further administration of contact or actions they  decide to take and that  any action would be acceptance of my fee schedule. In my draft I included that I would charge fees to individuals acting on behalf of the corporation as well as the  corp and that I would  collect and lien them. I am as you may know, threatening things I have no real clue how to carry out with any degree of certainty.   I like what Pete was talking about \" I would be happy to pay but I don't want to buy, and you have to buy before you can pay\"! I don't wanna buy. They don't deserve any more of the little we have left. Im not sure how to best administrate this best. I would just like them to go away and leave me alone as I don't have 14,000 cents at the moment.  My second thought was to accept the offer to pay through the SURETY for my PERSON or third, accept the offer and send a chq for a nominally lesser amount like 100.00 to settle the account?

The week after I defaulted him he sent the LEGAL NAME a Notice (three days ago) with an account Statement Balance of 0.00 for the LPT. It also states that the declaration for this period is outstanding.\n\nIt seems that he has taken it from Pay As You Earn (PAYE/Empe) to zero the account on the LPT. \nI was self employed until 2009 and I am a stay at home dad since 2009, there was no credits on their system for a tax refund. I rang the local county Revenue dept. in Louth and the woman on the phone said that a Homecarers allowance of €800 was added to the account recently and the LPT was deducted from that. She was unable to confirm how the Homecarers Allowance appeared on that PAYE account and then stated that she is unwilling to says any more about the situation. \n\nFinally, the questions I would like an answer to if you can help:\n1.\nIs that fraud on Michael Gladney’s part if he did create that Homecarers Allowance without my application for the Allowance? \n2.\nIs it fraud on his behalf for deducting from the Homecarers Allowance in to the LPT?\n3.\nIf it is fraud, would I be liable if I did not report it to the Garda (Police)?\n4.\nI informed the local Revenue dept. of this situation, is it up to them to sort out the internal mess if the Garda needs to be involved?\n5.\nIs it none of my business as it is an internal matter and should I forget about it and go have some craic with another department?

As many others around here, my brother lost his employment, and had to return the car to the bank, because he could not afford the monthly payments anymore. The bank then went and sold the car, then sent him a letter saying he owes over 6,000 grand. A BILL was never sent. This is all in letters that nobody dares to sign.\n\nMy brother sent a notice as administrator saying that he wanted to administrate any debt asap. He asked for a copy of any contract, and a BILL, and he would immediately administrate the debt. Also, he requested copies of 2 forms of ID of the alleged lawyer that was sending to communication, to prevent fraud. He gave 10 days. Unfortunately, he did not send the notice registered mail, but instead the USPS personnel convinced him to use certified mail. I did not find out about this until later.\n\nThe bank answered within the 10 days, sending just a copy of the contract. No BILL, or copy of id's were included.\n\nThen he sent a second notice asking for a BILL, and for copy of id's. He gave 10 days. Once again he did not send the notice registered mail, but certified mail. I did not find out about this until later.\n\nThe bank lawyer replied saying they did not recognized who was sending the communication, so they were going to disregard that notice. No BILL, or copy of id's were sent.\n\nAt this point, my brother comes to me to let me know what he is doing. He  sent a 3rd notice asking for a BILL, and giving some terms and condition. This time with an affirmation as sole authorized administrator, and once again asking for a BILL. This time it was sent registered mail.\n\nThe same day he sent his 3rd  and final PEREMPTORY NOTICE, also he received in his person's mailbox an invitation for the person to appear to a hearing. The bank had quickly placed a lawsuit, with no affidavit attached, using some debt collector weasel lawyer representing \"the bank\", saying over 6,000 were owed to the bank, and that my brother has not responded to the obligation.\n\nAdmiral Scott, and Pete, I have a few ideas of what an administrator should do in such case, but I would like to discuss some law ideas, and hear out things we can do, if we are in a similar situation.

I first noticed this not long after Dean Clifford's arrest, with instances recurring at an alarming rate.  The recent Robert Menard video-fiasco, and the ensuing comment skirmish on YouTube, was the latest example of this. I am referring to the apologist Free-Dumb attitude of “It's not HIS fault that things didn't work out for you, YOU made the choice to give him money so the blame lies with you”.  You will find this argument mirrored by practically ALL of the Dean Clifford crowd, as well as repeated by most any other Free-Dumb Guru's staunch defenders.\n\nLet's translate this into some examples that everyone can understand!\n\nIf you walked into Best Buy (for non-Canadians, insert your country's equivalent here!), and purchased the new 85” Samsung HD Smart television (A steal on Amazon, at only $39,997.99! http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN85S9-85-Inch-Ultra-120Hz/dp/B00CMEN95U ), when you arrived home and set it up, you would expect it to work.  If said television did NOT work, would you sit there and think to yourself “Well golly, there goes go forty some-odd grand!  But it's my own fault for trusting that Best Buy (or local equivalent) wouldn't sell me a defective product in the first place.”?  Hell no!  You would cart that puppy straight back in and demand a refund or replacement!  You would expect that the source from which you purchased this thing, would not only KNOW that the product works, but would GUARANTEE it just in case some unforeseen, manufacturer's defect happened to rear its ugly head!\n\nStill not clear?  Let's try another example.  If you contracted with someone to have your house painted/lawn cut/pool cleaned/home renovated/etc and paid them in advance, would you blame yourself if they didn't carry out the task for which they had been paid?  HELL no!  You would insist on either your money back, or the completion of the SERVICE FOR WHICH YOU PAID.\n\nSo, the question is, why do you people expect higher standards from your television and/or other material purchases or personal services, than you do for your freedom?  Because really, that's what is at stake in these legal matters.  A simple search on Google will turn up countless examples of “Freeman failures”.  There are even enough of them that RationalWiki has a direct link ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Freeman_on_the_land )!  The consequences of these failures are usually exorbitant fines, and/or jail time.  A little more serious than a scummy pool, and unruly yard. :p\n\nIf someone is selling a service, you should expect to get what you paid for.  You SHOULD expect accuracy!  If I advertised myself as being a contractor, and told you that I think I have this whole building-thing figured out...  Would you pay me to build your dream home?  Hell, would you pay me to build your DOG'S dream home?!  HELL NO!  If  I was a Math teachers and taught children that 2 + 2 = 5, would it be your kids fault when they flunk out at the end of the year?  HELL FUCKING NO!  It would be MINE, for teaching them INACCURATELY.  So why, WHY are you so eager and willing to lower your standards of expectation when it's your LIFE on the line? \n\nI CAN'T be the only one that finds this insane (aside from present company currently in this room), that would just be too depressing for words.  Dean Clifford, Robert Menard, Santos Bonacci, Karl Lentz, to name a few...  NONE of them have ANY business selling a service that they CANNOT GUARANTEE.  This SHOULD be COMMON FUCKING SENSE!!!!!  They are profiting off of people's ignorance and desperation, and gambling with your freedom and your lives in return. \n\nInvestigating on your own, accessing FREE information and formulating your own plan of attack; a resulting failure then WOULD be your fault because YOU made each and every one of those choices YOURSELF.  If, on the other hand, you have PAID someone for their services, the ONUS is on them to come through with what they have promised.  To provide ACCURATE information!  \n\nThis should not be complicated, I should NOT have to point this out.  Wake up, people.  Pull your heads out of your asses and start USING that brain!  This is the main difference between The Tender For Law, and basically every other group that is teaching law.  Scott Duncan DOESN'T charge money, and he encourages CRITICAL THOUGHT.  If any of the rest of you lot was capable of employing such a thing, we WOULDN'T need to be having this conversation right now, critical thinking easily reveals these logic gaps.  \n\nOkay, I'm finished ranting now.  Those of you who have not already reinserted your heads into your rectums, may proceed to do so now.  I'm really not expecting any less...

So once it was cashed a Notice of contract memorandum was drawn up by myself for my client. So, sent it right off and it was to acknowledge the agreement that was just established. So, 20days later she gets her update and its a zero balance as agreed. So, this might be a good win now. However, companies dont like to loose, so they will attempt to move the contract and try to get you to agree there is still an outstanding balance of 1000 even those your 20 dollar chq said it was to settle the account to zero.\n\nSo, what to do ? well, most get quite upset and angry and curse and say fuck, it didnt work.... :(  , well im saying they are merely attempting to move the contract with a new offer. So what to do with that ? well, accept it fully on the condition that, ....the contract already agreed upon, doesnt already settle the account and it would appears as fraud if they wished to purse the alleged debt any further after we came to an agreement right ? Well, this is why its soooooooo important to know contract law and read the damn books.

There has been too many promises over this time working on various aspects but now my time has come to an end.\n\nI am absolutely and unequivocally certain I will not return and will not want anything to do with the site or with Dean. It has been way too stressful on my part and it is not possible for me to keep things afloat.\n\nI have become rather disgruntled and impatient with much and there has been much chaos due to coming on board to this. I only came on board in hope to learn about obtaining tax exemption status and fighting parking tickets, somehow the projects grow and the roles and duties grew and no one else was willing to help despite many offers but this always ended in conflicts.\n\nI’ve had my life threatened, another has threatened to smash my teeth in and a couple have tried to use blackmail and threats also. This is all merely because Dean makes many promises to people to do business with them to sell law courses which many fight over him. It has been absolutely nuts and now I want no part in all this or any of Dean’s buddies or brother either.\n\nIt has been utterly traumatizing and humiliating. I have come to realise Dean protects moochers and scumbags but takes hard working people for granted. This has saddened me greatly due to how much energy and time I’ve spent on this. I am not saying he has nothing to offer because he does, I simply cannot work with him anymore and have had enough.\n\nAs for the forum, media and document service I had built, this will no longer be available. It is best to cut the cord and part ways completely as I do not want to spend any more time helping Dean or be burdened with all this. This was a partnership with Dean in which he gave many promises which he could not keep. His situation currently has been a factor of course but even before much was all dumped on me.\n\nI was never in support of his land stewardship program either despite him never being able to produce a plan or show how it could benefit me and my situation. This sounds selfish but we all want security and safety. I do not have either in this situation with him.\n\nDean has not tried to call me at all over 7 months and the messages I’ve gotten through his brother were one way and like a dictator. A PABX was setup and a variety of working numbers was provided but he never cared to get them approved.\n\nWith the projects and other tasks and duties, my time was spread too thin and always having the media, updates to process and reporting, it was hard to get everything I wanted to done.\n\nAs Dean’s situation deteriorated, this also effected new signups as numbers continued to dwindle. Many initially would sign up for $15 per month then quit in disappointment because they were expecting Dean’s involvement. Some may have just joined to watch the few videos that were provided but didn’t want to be a part of the community.\n\nNow in terms of figures as everyone always has money on the mind, many assumed there was up to 1200 or so members. Well as it turns out, at the start there was the option to register for an account without making a payment. It was determined that many of the accounts were fake due to automated bots originating from Russia which somehow managed to get past the CAPTURA code on the registration form. About 600 or more were fake which had no access anyway. Over time, about 300 either quit, stopped paying or had never paid and were given a free account. This left about 300 payment members only and some change.\n\nI cannot take on such burdens and expect to keep everyone happy and pay off Dean’s private property he bought. This is not my problem and want nothing to do with that either.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, due to so many people wanting to quit, complaining, and just fed up with all the issuing of empty promises, losing faith in the whole incarceration saga numbers continue to dwindle. Many of these members had actually signed up for beginner courses also and never got what they paid for. So at an attempt to keep them around until things improve, about 66% of these were cancelled but offered to pay a full year in advance instead. There was concerned that the wrong type of people would join also at an attempt to infiltrate and shit all over the community then leave as there was some shit stirrers and shills that did not join for the right reasons. It did not make sense to allow monthly subs were not working out. There was some new signups that paid yearly but not enough to sustain things at all.\n\nNow that the forum and any current and future services are no longer available for Dean, all subscriptions have been cancelled so those who joined need not worry about being charged for nothing. I utterly and totally wants nothing to do with Dean Clifford, his brother or any of their buddies ever again. It has turned out to be a complete disaster and so many burdens have been put on me and wishes I never came on board to do anything at all to begin with.\n\nThe web server has been handed over to another which will get in touch with Dean when he gets out. Knowing all the dramas and shit that has gone down outside of Dean’s case and even before then, she wants nothing to do with this mob either and will not talk with them at all also. These people lack integrity and just like to blow smoke up peoples arses most of the time.\n\nAs for the reporting, many lies were fed to him and inaccuracies. Much has come to light since then but it is too time consuming to cover every facet of detail.\n\nIn regards to Dean’s case, his gun and pot charges actually have not been dropped at all. I was misled to believe it was just one gun that was a WWII relic heirloom piece, but in fact Dean has a full arsenal. This is something the team wanted nothing to do with and especially the web admin who originally wrote some of the news posts. He wants nothing to do with guns or drugs and was merely involved to learn about tax issues which he was promised on be shown on how to get all your tax back. This was complete nonsense and just hot air Dean promised which never was going to happen in the first place.\n\nThe list of guns entail (Errors & Omissions Expected):\nBritish 303 rifle,\nan sks rifle,\n2 shot guns( Remington 870)\n.25 automatic pistol.\n.32 auto… The .25 is also a prohibited weapon (not restricted … Prohibited).\n\nPretty scary weapon cache there and sounds like something out of a movie.\n\nIn regards to the drug charges, the original news post was misleading and BS was fed there also, the grow op was actually for commercial purposes and not for a sick friend as originally told. Each to their own but being involved in such a thing attracts certain types of people which I want nothing to do with and that is why many cleared off and those who were helping prior to the arrest left and quit within a week or 2. I want nothing to do with such endeavors. Much has been obscured and kept secret.\n\nSome final words, anyone expecting to make a living out of freedom will have a rude awakening, it is a timeless story and with economies trending downwards and national debts exploding, it’s a given many more commanders and factions will be popping up to make a quick buck.\n\nA direct message to Dean: I sympathise with your suffering but this is your choice you made and no one else’s. I do not believe everything is a conspiracy though. You have woken so many people up and ignited interest from all over the world, so hats off to you. I just have to say, this is your war I do not care to fight in and I no longer care if you have the golden ticket. Hopefully you can get out soon and start over. I’m sure you will not be in short supply of people to help you hit the reset button.\n\nGoodbye for Good and forever. Admin.

Before we get started we are going to refer to the JURISDICTION I am most familiar with.  You will find mirrors of this in any JURISDICTION that uses a world reserve currency.\n\nIf you live in Buttfuck Montana I will not be able to point you to the ACT and/or STATUTE that says what I am going to show you here.  \n\nhttp://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/English/elaws_statutes_90c11_e.htm\n\nThe URL above will point you to the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO so you can sing along...\n\nBefore I start let's review a few LEGAL DEFINITIONS.  Those who have been studying the Maxims of Law will be familiar with the Maxim that says, \"The inclusion of one thing is the exclusion of everything else.\"  Like all good LEGAL documents I'm going to give away the answer right at the beginning and explain why this is true.\n\nEvery one who has been a victim of the CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY has been profoundly aware that FRAUD is occurring, and has been unaware of how to identify this FRAUD.  In order to have a child removed from a mother and/or father's custody an ORDER must be issued from the court that cites this very ACT.  There are exceptions to this RULE (imminent physical threat to a child, WARRANT from a JUSTICE OF THE PEACE inter alia), but that's not what we are covering here.  In this writing I am only going to focus on the long, drawn-out, cash-producing process laughingly called family law.\n\nIn every ACT and STATUTE, words are defined in the context of that ACT and/or STATUTE.  If the word \"light\" is defined in a STATUTE as \"darkness\", then in the context of that STATUTE, light means darkness.  A \"JUSTICE\" orders the kidnapping (and it is kidnapping) and/or alienation of a child with an ORDER in the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO.  So let's look at the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO.  What does \"ORDER\" mean in the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO?  Let's go see the interpretations section and its definitions....\n\n“ORDER” INCLUDES a REFUSAL to make an ORDER; (“arrêté, ordre et ordonnance”)...WHAT?\n\n...just looking through the ACT to see if there's a bit more detail here...nope, that's it.  That's all it says.  I assume the parties who drafted this ACT were never taught that you should never use the word you're defining in a definition.\n\nIn THE TENDER FOR LAW our standard operating procedure is to look up every single word, even if you think you know what it means; and in every case it always turn out that you don't.  So let's go through that sentence, one word at a time.  In our fresh new definition of \"ORDER\" we are \"INCLUDING\" something, which in legalese means we are EXCLUDING everything else.  In this case we are including a REFUSAL(?)  How can you include a refusal? (hey don't look at me...I didn't write this...I'm just telling you what it says)\n\nSince refusal is not defined in this ACT we'll have to step up to a more general level.  Let's see what Black's Law 9th Edition has to say about the word \"refusal\":\n\n\"An opportunity to accept or reject something before it is offered to others; the right or privilege of having this opportunity.\"...well, there's a privilege worth waiving!  In fact I dare say that of all the privileges and benefits one would wish to waive, this should at least be in your top five.  Dean Clifford and the guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth (\"How do I sound\"? - Tony Butros, HOW TO WITH DEAN CLIFFORD-Ep13 Family Law www.blogtalkradio.com) are selling this as a benefit. \n\nIn fact, they're asking you to beg for it when they tell you to use APPLICATIONS and MOTIONS (...Yeh, you like that don't 'ya bitch!).\n\nRather than begging for your own victimization, a little effort tearing this apart will serve you much better.  Since we're talking about ORDERS and MAKING ORDERS let's take a quick peek at the word \"MAKE\" since we have Black's Law lying open here...\n\nMAKE, according to Black's Law 9th Edition, \"To legally perform, as by executing, signing, OR delivering (a document) (to make a contract)\"\n\nOh look, they use the word \"OR\"!  Don't you just love it when they give you a selection?  Always remember legalese does NOT actually \"lie\", it simply presumes you know what the words mean (as a CIVILIAN! HAR!  Oh, I slay me!).\n\nSo when a \"JUSTICE\" MAKES an ORDER he gets a selection from the \"bullshit buffet\" that is the LAW, but he can only pick one, OR the other.  Neither of these options actually apply to YOU.  By ACCEPTING the ORDER you are in fact, EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS to \"BENEFIT\" from it, before everyone else can.  Yes, you are accepting SURETY before anyone else gets a chance; and while I'm not one to tell you how to run your affairs, I personally think that that would be a MISTAKE!  And we all know what to do about MISTAKES.  \n\nNow I want you to \"fire up\" that little lump of protoplasm you laughingly call a brain, and ask yourself, \"Which makes more sense?  Begging to be part of the JURISDICTION and all of its \"BENEFITS\" or following the Number 1 Rule of the Universe (Scott is ALWAYS right!  Especially as regards LAW).  Lawyers used to come to me when they got in over their heads, and I was shoved A LOT of payola under the table for my services.  Single mothers reading this know how to express their gratitude.  You may APPLY to Tara for the opportunity to provide remuneration.\n\nSo let's go through this fascinating definition one more time, translated to laymen's terms:\n\nIn the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO a \"JUSTICE\" will issue an opportunity to ACCEPT a BENEFIT before everyone else.  So basically ORDER in this context actually OFFERS YOU the RIGHT TO DECLINE.  I guarantee that none of you who have had your children stolen, DECLINED that ORDER.  In fact I dare say you ACCEPTED it.  That would be a MISTAKE.  \n\nIssuing a NOTICE OF MISTAKE will correct this, because another Maxim of Law says, \"That which can be done, can be undone\".  Serving by registered mail a modified NOTICE OF MISTAKE to all participating PARTIES, will remedy this MISTAKE.  \n\nAnd now we will cover our new \"word of the day\", \"PETITION\":\n\nPETITION, according to Black's Law 9th Edition, \"A formal written request presented to a court or other official body.\"\n\nThose few of you who actually have a fucking clue who I am, know that among my many titles is ADMIRAL.  I exercise my RIGHTS and DUTIES strictly through ADMIRALTY, so I totally know what I'm talking about here.  I, as an ADMIRAL, have TRUSTEES SERVING me.  I do not bark ORDERS at my TRUSTEES.  I only do that to my inferiors.  My TRUSTEES are most certainly NOT my inferiors.  When I need a task performed for AQUILAE I REQUEST.  Returning to the definition of PETITION you will see that this is also a request.  I therefore PETITION my TRUSTEES to execute tasks on behalf of the TRUST.  TRUSTEES do not serve an ADMIRAL; an ADMIRAL SERVES HIS TRUSTEES.  The \"payment\" for this \"service\" is the TRUSTEE'S OATH to GRANT ALL MY REQUESTS.  It is the COURT's DUTY to do the same.\n\nThis group's name \"THE TENDER FOR LAW\" is actually a translation to layman's terms of \"THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER\".  They mean the same thing.  So naturally money comes into the picture.  Remember our group's Maxim...\"Follow the money\".  In this particular case we don't want to follow any money, we want to stop the flow of money.\n\nAll of you have heard the old adage, \"The buck stops here.\"  Translated to legalese, \"the buck stops here\" = \"NON-NEGOTIABLE\".  In the construction of our PETITION we are going to contain, in its body, a cessation of negotiation.  When dissecting documents that have a financial interest, we have learned that documents signed by a \"PERSON\" are considered NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS under the LAW.  \n\nTherefore in our PETITION, the first words that appear should be NON-NEGOTIABLE.  This is similar to putting \"WITHOUT PREJUDICE\" on the top of a document.  NEGOTIATE does not mean bargain or haggle, it means to EXECUTE a financial transaction.  NON-NEGOTIABLE literally means \"the buck stops here\".  Reading through Black's Law will show you numerous types of petitions, and reading them in the context demonstrated here will make these petitions very, very clear...even a chick can do it.\n\nAt this point I would like everyone to know that I DO NOT provide LEGAL service; I only point you in the right direction.  Therefore I cannot draw up a petition for you as I did with the NOTICE OF MISTAKE.  NOTICE OF MISTAKE existed in the real world before I typed up any document regarding it.  Therefore I was quoting, which means I have not stepped outside of any LEGAL restriction.  When The second I issue a petition you can bet your sorry, incompetent asses I'll be quoting it here.  Until that happens though, you'd best use the comments section to ask any questions you may have.  For the sake of your children do not listen to Dean and the guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth; they are deliberately misleading you!  When you discover this is true (and you will if you listen to them), you are welcomed to board any AQUILAE vessel and beg me for forgiveness where I promise there will be a loyal and capable TRUSTEE standing by to kick you in the face, and toss you overboard.\n\nSo post your questions and keep on topic. As this is the most important thread, our fun banter is not permitted here!\n\n...except when I do it. Child and Family Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.

The document below is to be read orally to the court following conviction of a (whatever) and just prior to “sentencing”. The particular allocution below is the work and experience of one man during a “traffic” trial with a “charge” of “no valid registration (plates)”. There are two parts to the allocution: (a) declamation of rights and errors in the trial, etc, along with producing affidavits, information and mitigating facts, and (b) declamation of non-consent to any fines, taxes, prison, etc. Allocution has its origins in the common law. (See Corpus Juris Secundum, Criminal Law, §1573-1576). One must be totally alert to ask for the opportunity to “say something prior to sentencing” before the judge starts his sentencing – interrupt if necessary, but do it. Request a separate sentencing hearing of at least two weeks hence. Give yourself time to write the allocution. 2. Do not give this information in writing to the court or to opposing attorney before-hand as it is only valid when orally presented to the court by the live sentient man/woman and you do not want to forewarn the enemy. The legal fiction is civilly dead and cannot speak. 3. The court needs your consent to impose any sentencing or “punishment” or fines or restrictions of any kind, etc. In almost 100% of the cases the sentient man/woman becomes the surety (or stand in) for the legal fiction “defendant” and takes on the burden of the sentencing pronouncements. It is the legal fiction which is indicted, tried, and convicted. It is the sentient man/woman who takes on the sentence. The court needs the permission (consent) of the sentient man to impose a sentence and gets it through presumption, silence, acquiescence, or outright consent to apply to the “surety”. It is the sentient man/woman who now serves the sentence. The style of the case through conviction for the “defendant” is in all capital letters. The style of the sentenced party is upper and lower case. 4. When finished with the oral allocution, one must turn around and walk out of the court and its jurisdiction immediately. DO NOT HEAR the judge or the prosecutor or anyone else, even if they are screaming at you to “STOP”, or “Come back here!” If one does, then jurisdiction is given back to the court, i.e. you have contracted back in. 5. Allocution, Part One: During the trial you were denied exculpatory evidence such as the court not answering motions, notices, affidavits, allowing witnesses, etc. Keep a list of such omissions, errors, and due process denial during the trial, especially constitutional guarantees. 6. Allocution. Part Two: Read the following statement (i.e. create your own written statement to reflect your specific situation and trial activities). There is no time limit on its reading. Do not give in to interruptions. FOR THE RECORD YOUR HONOR: I am a Man, living upon the land and speaking as only a Man can. I was created in the image of Yashua under the authority of the redeemer, Jesus Christ with all of My senses intact. I am canceling the conviction and all appearances on My part and now cancel any and all contracts, entered into by Me, knowingly or unknowingly by any methods including but not limited to verbal, by assent. consent, presumption, assumption, deception, threat, duress, coercion, fraud, fiction, fantasy or illusions, or any other method, including words of art, magic, and sophistry, casuistry or out right lying, or by specious acts of fallacious, deceptive, delusive, misleading, apparent, illusive, illusory, ostensible, practice of law.(a) This proceeding has failed to produce evidence of an injured party.(b) This proceeding has failed to produce an affidavit of verified complaint, or the existence of a complaining party.(c) This proceeding has failed to produce an injured party onto the witness stand for testimony.(d) This proceeding has failed to produce and to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.(e) This proceeding has failed to produce an honorable ruling, therefore the court could rule only by an undisclosed presumption of an assumed intention, and this may be deemed the practice of witchcraft by a Satanic Cabal.(f) This proceeding – and this court – has now lost all jurisdiction by it’s denial of due process. I have not violated Yashua’s law. I have not caused an injury to another living man. This would be a violation of the Royal law of love your neighbor as yourself, or man’s interpretation “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”. I have not committed a crime, and there is nothing on which to convict Me, thus the conviction is null and void. And, any Bonds affiliated or associated with this case, whether they were issued with the citation in the form of a bid bond, or as an appearance bond, or as a performance bond which have been written as a result of this procedure – and any other bonds written in any way, shape or form whatsoever – I hereby now cancel, terminate, discharge, dismiss, deactivate, eradicate, nullify, quash, rescind, repeal, revoke, abrogate, abolish, and expunge – and I forbid the commercial use of My name and likeness for profit, as all Bonds created, whether on the record or not, are void ab initio as only I, a Man can cause. I do not accept any offer to, nor do I give consent to, nor will I go to jail, go to prison, pay or discharge any fines, fees, court costs, nor taxes of any kind. I do not accept nor consent to have My rights blocked or impeded in any way. shape, or form. I do not accept any offer, nor consent to have My body or possessions seized or confiscated or used by anyone or their agent for their own use, or for the benefit of another. I do not accept any offer nor do I consent to probation, parole, pre- or post-trial release, or any other form of supervision imposed for this matter or in association with this matter which may be attempted to be linked with or in causation with this matter, or placed twice in jeopardy for the same pretended crime. I, this man, [ full name ], reserve all My natural God-given unalienable birth rights, waiving none, ever – as all is conditional upon My receipt of your written statement of claims and proof of claim to the contrary under your bond of office and penalties of perjury. My public business here is completed, perfected, discharged, accomplished, dismissed, concluded, terminated and, as Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior stated: FINISHED! 7. Immediately turn around and walk out of the court room. DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE JUDGE OR THE OPPOSING ATTORNEY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. If the judge asks for a copy of your allocution, do NOT respond. It is on the record and he can get it there. If the bailiff stands in your path on the way out, ask him to arrest the judge for treason (abrogated his oath of office) and move on. Do not hesitate. 8. According to Michael Stone, this procedure is authorized under FRCP Rule 60, 1946 Amendment, Note to Subdivision (b). “Since the rules have been in force, decisions have been rendered that the use of bills of review, coram nobis. or audita querela, to obtain relief from final judgments is still proper, and that various remedies of this kind still exist although they are not mentioned in the rules and the practice is not prescribed in the rules. It is obvious that the rules should be complete in this respect and define the practice with respect to any existing rights or remedies to obtain relief from final judgments.” et seq.

It is put forth to most as a reflection of what it really is. Those who follow the bible really have absolutely NO FUCKING IDEA what it means unless some “minister” tells them what it means. Because who could really read that thing and have a clue what any of that shit means other than it is a FICTION book. \n\nBut when some guy tells you “this is what it means” and “this is how you should live TO BE HAPPY”... everyone goes with that. Yet that same “guy” diddled your son you find out later... but let’s ignore that...\n\n... Yes, the only way to be happy is to listen to that guy. \n\nHere’s an example of what someone I care about who has been brought up very religiously sent me after sending them my “NOT MINE” booklet:\n\n\"Romans 13:6-8\n6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants (so now figure out who is “god”, huh?), who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.\"\n\nSo “god” must be a bank then, correct? Oh, but that “minister” forgot to tell you HOW TO PAY. RESPECT=Accept. FOR HONOUR=Accept for Honor, or Supra Protest. It is described in the “Bills of Exchange”. Who’d have thunk?\n\nAnd here, I acronym: FFS! It is easy to see once you ACCEPT THE TRUTH OF IT ALL.\n\nand more...\n\n\"Romans 13: 5,6\n\n5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.\"\n\nYes! They created this shitty MONEY OF DEBT... and you are going to either figure out how it works, with another delusion of shitty public school system (which would be impossible), or by yourself (otherwise known as basically impossible)... and your left with...\n\noh right. Warehouse... for your benefit? \n\nHere’s the rest of that response:\n\n“Does this make any sense? Rules are meant to be followed? Yes? - It creates harmony and respect each other. Please work on paying your utility billings - I would not want them to put a lien on your property that you live in and have paid into for so long.  \n\n-Also everyone is out there earning a living, paying taxes, paying bills - are you thinking our govt will pay our way? just because we are its property? It is merely a way of tracking our existence and making sure we \"pay our own way for the privilege of living here.\" The bigger question is - Would we get that opportunity else where in this world? On another note though - I always admired your strength of always giving 100% of yourself when it came to learning something or figuring out how to do something - Always training yourself how to do things that are crazy difficult for most but you dive in and research or keep pushing yourself to find out how to make it work (web designing, renovating and earning your interior design certification, just to name a few) With that in mind - I think your disappointment  in our govt run country should be taken with a different approach - Politics!! LOL better to understand from this inside!!”\n\n...wow\n\nSo, does anyone see how this “bible”, by way of its “teachers/ministers” has misconstrued what is going on?\n\nOn that note, can we not \"bounce\" bible thumpers so quickly and maybe show them their delusion? Like the last fella so recently bounced. :( "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_675307979171804","body":"The Future of Bitcoin reason.com The virtual currency is more resilient than its critics suggest.

Could someone bump the thread about the dogecoin stuff that had 1300+ comments? It was referred to in another thread I was reading but I can not find it with this mobile app... Perhaps I can when I get home.\n\nMy second question is in regard to something Scott Duncan has said in multiple threads about how we are thinking wrong, and putting value on the wrong things. I have for a long time (back into my teens) always held the position that the only thing I really have that is of any value is my time. I remember discussing this with my wife (girlfriend at the time) when she had brought home a case of beer for me and then carelessly dropped it in the driveway and smashed half of it. She thought I was mad about having the beer, and I was trying to explain that the beer is only beer, bought with money that is only money. Both of which I can easily replace, but the time is gone forever.\nMy question is.. Am I on the right track with that line of thinking or should I be digging into that a little more?\nHave you guys already covered this in another thread that I haven't gotten to yet?\n\nThanks for your time, thanks for keeping all the posts up (even the ones you refer to as shit stains have something there to ponder) "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_670424622993473","body":""},{"post_id":"462493170453287_494817297220874","body":"THE TENDER FOR LAW – SURETY FOR IDIOTS - PART II - WAIVING THE LEGAL NAME  (c) 2013 ROGUESUPPORT INC. under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING is an ENHANCED and TENDER FOR LAW ANNOTATED [In Square Brackets] version of section 2.1 of The ONTARIO \"Change of Name Act\" [R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER C.7... see what I did there?

He said he wasn't stopping ME (could have fooled me). It was a check for drunk driving and valid licenses and insurance. So I gave the prick the license. Then was asked if I had anything to drink this evening. They DO know that in order for one to live, one must drink......right? At this point my options were to say sweet \"F\" all and end up being hauled off anyway, tell him it is none of his business and get hauled off, or be honest and up front and hope he isn't a complete steroid junky moron (I realize the odds). \"Yup. I had a couple of sips of his at dinner.\" He then said, \"So if I was to ask you to blow for me...\" I interrupted with \"I would say, 'No'.\" He, of course, got really offended as some men seem to think it is their right to have you blow for them. There was some discussion about providing proof and swearing affidavit. He threatened to haul ME to jail and criminally charge the person. At this point I WANT to say \"I don't go anywhere with strange men with guns, and I don't blow for ANYONE for free (unless I initiate)\", but I am sure my passenger would have been even more horrified with my non-compliant behaviour so I simply repeated \"No\". He then took the license and \"ran\" it then came back and blablablaed about how he was going to \"let\" me leave THIS time and IF he had a partner with him he would have hauled me off so I better be good next time and blow even if I haven't drank a drop. \nI am curious as to where I would have led them to believe I am to be violated at their whim. When I signed for the driver's license, is an answer I have been told. That can be easily fixed with notice, however, I know the next moron who blocks my travels won't give a rats ass about any notice. I also don't think that signing for a driver's license IS where that presumption comes from. Please correct me if I am wrong, but is not signing for the license agreeing to follow the rules of the road? And if one has NOT broken ANY of those rules when pulled over, does that not mean I have every right to keep going until proven otherwise? AT LEAST produce reasonable evidence that suggests I AM breaking one of those rules. The mere fact of being pulled over in the first place is already violating MY time, but I KNOW if I was to tell him THAT, I probably wouldn't be typing this.

This is a useful, powerful document that also instantly removes SURETY. I framed it in such a way that you can replace the name \"Dean Clifford\" with your name, and you can make a pad of these things. Have lots of copies to hand out to friends and opposing counsel. Hell the court clerk loves these things too...make sure the court clerk has one as well. Just make sure you UNDERSTAND what the document says. Read it carefully and understand what the words mean, because you will be challenged. And remember, the NOTICE by its very nature, presents several questions.\n\nDo not permit the proceedings to move forward without these questions being answered!\n\nBecause so many people ask for it, transcribed here is the copy of THE ROGUESUPPORT NOTICE OF MISTAKE.\n\nScott Duncan:  *Sigh*\n\nSubmit it as an EXHIBIT in an AFFIDAVIT.

If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR SUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led A COURT and/or STATUTORY BODY and/or A GOVERNMENT SERVICE and/or AGENTS and/or OFFICERS of such bodies, to believe, by responding to “You”, and/or “JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN”, and/or SUCH OTHER IDENTIFICATION, such bodies HAVE ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am, in ANY CAPACITY, a Pro Se litigant  and/or a LEGAL PERSON in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE, as I DO NOT CONSENT and WAIVE THE BENEFIT to such titles (Waiver of the CHANGE OF NAMES ACT OF ONTARIO). Please forgive me.\n4.  THEREFORE: As I have no knowledge of who “You” and or “JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN” and/or SUCH OTHER IDENTIFICATION ANY COURT and/or STATUTORY BODY and/or GOVERNMENT SERVICE and/or AGENTS and/or OFFICERS of such bodies [HEREAFTER \"YOU\"], HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, I RESPECTFULLY ASK; by WHAT AUTHORITY ARE \"YOU\" ADDRESSING me as such?\n5.  As the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT [In the custody of Justice Wailan Low, ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE: Court File Number CV-11-430464], WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I, as a MAN who is not lawfully entitled to the BENEFITS of a BIRTH CERTIFICATE [PPSACA13078], have any SURETY in this matter?\n6.  As GOVERNMENT is the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY on the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE), with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME, WHAT EVIDENCE do YOU have that I am a TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME. WHAT EVIDENCE do YOU have that I am a TRUSTEE and have ANY SURETY with respect to ANY NAME?\n7.  WHAT EVIDENCE do YOU have, that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a TRUSTEE and/or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN? WHAT EVIDENCE do \"YOU\" have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the principal?\n8.  WHAT EVIDENCE do \"YOU\" have that there has been any meeting of the minds, any PROPER NOTICE given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or that I have ANY INTENT to CONTRACT in this matter?\n\nAs such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and CLOSURE.\n\n[ AUTHORISED BY:                              ] [ AQUILAE Trust Seal]\n\n- \"POINT-OF-ORDER!\"..... (Scott has typed-out two versions of this so far...use some words at your own peril) :/\n\nHere is my court room position in a nutshell.\n\nYou do not accept surety – EVER.\n\nStep 1: Reserve all rights. (get Derek Moran [im honoured to be mentioned, by the way] to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\n\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed. Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS. If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.\n\nAnything outside of this supports their position that you are “playing” their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules. The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.\n\nThink very carefully about this. If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\nand its rules, you might raise the obvious question, “Why do you get to move two pieces?” If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to “understand” that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game. You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert. \n\nIf you UNDERSTAND, you accept SURETY.\n\nAs stated YOU=SURETY\n\nIf you're ever in a courtroom and do not wish to have the \"benefit of SURETY\", you have but to object to being addressed as \"YOU\". There are many ways to do this. Dean Clifford might say, in response to being addressed as \"YOU\", \"If I have led the court to believe that I am SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me.\" (FUN FACT: A court MUST ALWAYS grant forgiveness when asked and/or requested)\n\nOthers, like myself, are a lot more succinct. For example, I might respond, \"FUCK YOU! You're a YOU, I'm a ME! By what AUTHORITY do YOU address ME as a \"YOU\"?\", because I can get away with it. The reason I can get away with it is that I UNDERSTAND the UCC as opposed to ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD which spreads mythology and bullshit about the UCC.\n\n  Section 1, Subsection 308, of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE covers RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. This is a well-known fact, and this is how you use it.\n\nVersion #1:  On entering the court, you aggressively make the first motion, that being, the RESERVATION OF YOUR RIGHTS. But since you're the only one in the courtroom with ACTUAL STANDING, you can be a total dick about it. You don't RESERVE YOUR RIGHTS, you RESERVE ALL RIGHTS! Not just yours, EVERYONE's.

This is a useful, powerful document that also instantly removes SURETY. I framed it in such a way that you can replace the name \"Dean Clifford\" with your name, and you can make a pad of these things. Have lots of copies to hand out to friends and opposing counsel. Hell the court clerk loves these things too...make sure the court clerk has one as well. Just make sure you UNDERSTAND what the document says. Read it carefully and understand what the words mean, because you will be challenged. And remember, the NOTICE by its very nature, presents several questions.\n\nDo not permit the proceedings to move forward without these questions being answered!\n\nBecause so many people ask for it, transcribed here is the copy of THE ROGUESUPPORT NOTICE OF MISTAKE.\n\nScott Duncan:  *Sigh*\n\nSubmit it as an EXHIBIT in an AFFIDAVIT.

TAKE NOTICE THAT: In the matter of SURETY for the LEGAL NAME, I believe that there has been a MISTAKE, as the SOLE BENEFICIARY OF A PUBLIC DOCUMENT has been INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED as an \"accused\" and/or a \"suspect\". \n2.  FORGIVE ME: If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR SUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led A COURT and/or STATUTORY BODY and/or A GOVERNMENT SERVICE and/or AGENTS and/or OFFICERS of such bodies, to believe, by responding to “You”, and/or “JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN”, and/or SUCH OTHER IDENTIFICATION, such bodies HAVE ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am the PARTY WITH SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE, and please forgive me.\n3.  If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR SUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led A COURT and/or STATUTORY BODY and/or A GOVERNMENT SERVICE and/or AGENTS and/or OFFICERS of such bodies, to believe, by responding to “You”, and/or “JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN”, and/or SUCH OTHER IDENTIFICATION, such bodies HAVE ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am, in ANY CAPACITY, a Pro Se litigant  and/or a LEGAL PERSON in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE, as I DO NOT CONSENT and WAIVE THE BENEFIT to such titles (Waiver of the CHANGE OF NAMES ACT OF ONTARIO). Please forgive me.\n4.  THEREFORE: As I have no knowledge of who “You” and or “JOHN SCOTT DUNCAN” and/or SUCH OTHER IDENTIFICATION ANY COURT and/or STATUTORY BODY and/or GOVERNMENT SERVICE and/or AGENTS and/or OFFICERS of such bodies [HEREAFTER \"YOU\"], HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, I RESPECTFULLY ASK; by WHAT AUTHORITY ARE \"YOU\" ADDRESSING me as such?\n5.  As the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT [In the custody of Justice Wailan Low, ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE: Court File Number CV-11-430464], WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I, as a MAN who is not lawfully entitled to the BENEFITS of a BIRTH CERTIFICATE [PPSACA13078], have any SURETY in this matter?\n6.  As GOVERNMENT is the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY on the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE), with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME, WHAT EVIDENCE do YOU have that I am a TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME. WHAT EVIDENCE do YOU have that I am a TRUSTEE and have ANY SURETY with respect to ANY NAME?\n7.  WHAT EVIDENCE do YOU have, that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a TRUSTEE and/or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN? WHAT EVIDENCE do \"YOU\" have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the principal?\n8.  WHAT EVIDENCE do \"YOU\" have that there has been any meeting of the minds, any PROPER NOTICE given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or that I have ANY INTENT to CONTRACT in this matter?\n\nAs such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and CLOSURE.\n\n[ AUTHORISED BY:                              ] [ AQUILAE Trust Seal]\n\n- \"POINT-OF-ORDER!\"..... (Scott has typed-out two versions of this so far...use some words at your own peril) :/\n\nHere is my court room position in a nutshell.\n\nYou do not accept surety – EVER.\n\nStep 1: Reserve all rights. (get Derek Moran [im honoured to be mentioned, by the way] to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\n\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed. Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS. If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.\n\nAnything outside of this supports their position that you are “playing” their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules. The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.\n\nThink very carefully about this. If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\nand its rules, you might raise the obvious question, “Why do you get to move two pieces?” If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to “understand” that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game. You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert. \n\nIf you UNDERSTAND, you accept SURETY.\n\nAs stated YOU=SURETY\n\nIf you're ever in a courtroom and do not wish to have the \"benefit of SURETY\", you have but to object to being addressed as \"YOU\". There are many ways to do this. Dean Clifford might say, in response to being addressed as \"YOU\", \"If I have led the court to believe that I am SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me.\" (FUN FACT: A court MUST ALWAYS grant forgiveness when asked and/or requested)\n\nOthers, like myself, are a lot more succinct. For example, I might respond, \"FUCK YOU! You're a YOU, I'm a ME! By what AUTHORITY do YOU address ME as a \"YOU\"?\", because I can get away with it. The reason I can get away with it is that I UNDERSTAND the UCC as opposed to ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD which spreads mythology and bullshit about the UCC.\n\n  Section 1, Subsection 308, of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE covers RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. This is a well-known fact, and this is how you use it.\n\nVersion #1:  On entering the court, you aggressively make the first motion, that being, the RESERVATION OF YOUR RIGHTS. But since you're the only one in the courtroom with ACTUAL STANDING, you can be a total dick about it. You don't RESERVE YOUR RIGHTS, you RESERVE ALL RIGHTS! Not just yours, EVERYONE's. You remove everyone else's rights and give them to yourself. WHY? Because \"Fuck off that's WHY!\" You're the only one with STANDING.\n\nIf you HOLD the power, WIELD it...don't be such a pussy! If you're entitled to ALL RIGHTS, CLAIM THEM. This is how you do it.\n\nWhen the \"justice\" starts speaking, interrupt them. Say, \"Point of order!\" They will immediately be silent.

Maybe you can find some remedy in this communication for yourself or someone you know.\nPlease share it as you will, perhaps an eye or two can be opened. I've removed personal contact information in order to protect the presumed guilty...   :)\n\nLast time I checked, google was still functional, so stop watching TV and start looking into what's really going on in those shit holes called court houses...\n\nTo: XXXXXXXXX@XXXXXXXX\nSubject: EXPOSE THE FRAUD\n \nPUBLIC INQUIRY DEMANDED INTO TRAFFIC COURT FRAUD \n\n        I wish  to express my concerns over the situation in the Provincial Court (Traffic). I do some work as a Paralegal and a Provincial Court Agent, helping people with Traffic Tickets among other things, I also operate what I call the Legal Help Society as part of my service. The recent articles  in the Edmonton Sun regarding; “The Tough Road Ahead”by Rick Bell, in the Edmonton Journal regarding the “Photo Radar Cash Cow” by Dave Staples, in the Edmonton Sun \"Denial of Justice\" (Apr. 1, 2014) by Kevin Martin and CTV News article by Sarah Richter, \"Province looking to take traffic infractions out of the Provincial Court\", caused me to contact you . \n\n       I believe the people involved in the Traffic Ticket Agent Industry are partly responsible for some of these articles, I am not among them and I do not really subscribe to their views. They appear to have also gotten the Edmonton Criminal Trial Lawyers Assoc. and their Calgary counterparts to issue statements to the media concerning \"The Erosion of Civil Rights\", if the accused in a Traffic Ticket Matter cannot confront their accuser, (the cop who issued the ticket) in a so called“Court of Law”. If they think that by confronting a cop, in a so called Court of Law will get them any justice or preserve their civil rights, they are sadly Mistaken and Delusional. \n\n         I Do Not Say What I Am About To Say Lightly, my  experience  has been, that it “JUST DOESN’T MATTER” if you face your accuser or not. The Provincial Court (Traffic) system is so RIGGED and so FRAUDULENT, and on so Many Different Levels, that its very Difficult if not Impossible, to get your head around all the different frauds involved, just so you can defend yourself properly. Because of this “SYSTEMIC FRAUD” it's very difficult to win your case at any time, if at all.\n\n       Without going into too many legal details,  I believe, that the “Fundamental Issue” is that the Provincial Court(Traffic) OPERATES ILLEGALLY, I will explain. The Provincial Court of Alberta (Traffic) and the so called crown prosecutors who bring these “fraudulent quasi-criminal”(a very important legal concept) traffic charges forward, and  who run the trials, and who seem to “Control and Operate This Court For Their Own Benefit”, fall under the mandate of the Provincial Minister of Justice(J. Denis).  However  the “Traffic Safety Act”(The Act) under which people are prosecuted (persecuted), falls under the mandate of the Minister of Transportation (W. Drysdale). Pursuant to sec. 22 of the Act, the Minister has the “Alberta Transportation and Safety Board”(the Board) administer the Act on his behalf. Starting at sec. 27 of the Act,  the Alberta Transportation and Safety Board is vested with “All The Powers” of the Court of Queen's Bench for the trials of civil actions, which allows the Board to become a Superior Court in it's own right, just like the Court of Queen's Bench, (almost). The Board has the Right to Hold Hearings, Reviews and Appeals as to ANY MATTER coming before it under the TRAFFIC SAFETY ACT, which is “Administrative Law”, and not a law of “General Application”(which would apply to everybody). Any decision of the Board “CAN ONLY BE REVIEWED” by a Court of Superior Jurisdiction ( i.e. the Court of Queen's Bench, the Court of Appeal of Alberta, The Supreme Court of Canada), and only on “ONE  ISSUE” pursuant to sec. 47.1 (1), (2),  (3) of the Act, that being of \"PATENT UNREASONABLENESS\". My question is; “What Business Does The Provincial Court (Traffic) An “Inferior Court”, Have Sticking It's Nose Where It Doesn't Belong?” Under the Act,\"ONLY” the Alberta Transportation and Safety Board is the “Court of Original Jurisdiction and First Instance” (or at least it's supposed to be). Both the Minister of Justice(J. Denis) and the Minister of Transportation(W. Drysdale) know whats going on, and I will be referring to that shortly. The “Inferior Court” being the  Provincial Court of Alberta (Traffic) by “USURPING THE JURISDICTION” of the Alberta Transportation Safety Board, is involved in a FRAUD. The “Superior Court” being the Alberta Transportation and Safety Board, CANNOT DELEGATE any of it's Powers or Jurisdiction to the “Inferior Court” as this would be an UNCONSTITUTIONAL DELEGATION  and a FRAUD.\n\n            Discussions between the Minister of Transportation and the Minister of Justice are currently underway to “QUIETLY TRANSFER OUT” of the Provincial Court System this “FRAUDULENT and ILLEGAL TRAFFIC COURT”(and not for the reasons that they claim) and to set up a type of Adjudicator answerable only to the Alberta Transportation Safety Board, where the matter “HAS ALWAYS BELONGED”. The people opposed to this plan are naturally the Traffic Ticket Agents,also the Traffic Court Commissioners,  the crown prosecutors , and others (including the Police) involved in this “CORRUPT AND FRAUDULENT INDUSTRY” centered in and around  the Provincial Court (Traffic) ,who stand to lose their jobs. A tip from a friend revealed that  questions concerning these issues would be brought forward by Wild Rose justice critic Mr. Shane Saskiw  and Liberal justice critic Ms. Laurie Blakeman, during Question Period in the Legislature on Thurday, April 10, 2014. They both weighed in on the Minister of Justice, as to the Erosion of Civil Rights  and the Right to Confront Your Accuser in a Court of Law. The Minister was able to deflect their questions  by claiming that Any Talks Were Preliminary and Nothing Had Been Decided, and that any defendant would always be able to confront their accusers. It appeared, although I may be wrong that both the honorable members Blakeman and Saskiw appeared to be in  “Lockstep”, in representing the interests of the Traffic Ticket Agents and their associates, and I believe failed to ask the “Real Question” of why the matter was in the Provincial Court (Traffic) in the first place? \n\n        As you probably know, the “REAL ANSWER” to the question ( $41,300,000 in revenue from traffic fines for 2013 in Edmonton alone) is“Money”. Pursuant to sec. 7.1(1)(2) \"REVENUE OFFSET\" of the Provincial Offenses Procedure Act , Procedures Regulation, Alberta Regulation 233/1989,  the Crown (prosecutors) can claim “16.67 %\" of all fines collected by the traffic court, with the balance going pursuant to sec. 162(1) of the Traffic Safety Act, to the municipality where the alleged offense occurred, usually into their police budgets. Little wonder that these so called crown prosecutors “FRAUDULENTLY STEER” traffic violations towards the“COURT THAT THEY CONTROLLED”, 16.67% of $41.3 million(plus) is,( let me do the math) at least $ 6,884,710.00 if not more, in Edmonton alone for 2013,and possibly $ 100 MILLION PLUS for the Province as a whole, and these “CROOKS” claim that they represent the Minister of Justice, sure they do, or do they really(only he can answer that)? Money corrupts and has corrupted our Courts of Justice. (contact  Shannon Prithipaul (pres. edmt. crim. trial lawyers assoc.)concerning the defunding of Legal Aid)\n\n           Upon Reading The Entire “Traffic Safety Act”, the Provincial Court of Alberta is “NOT MENTIONED ONCE”, the only Courts ever mentioned are the Alberta Transportation Safety Board and the Court of Queen's Bench. These so called crown prosecutors will argue that the sec. 2 of the Provincial Offenses Procedure Act allows them to bring the issue before the Provincial Court(traffic). They will claim that sec. 2 of the Act states that;   \"... this Act  applies to every case in which a person commits or is suspected of committing an offense...\", Thats All Fine And Good , however they FRAUDULENTLY AND DELIBERATELY FAIL TO INFORM any defendant who they prosecute (persecute), that the First Part Of That Sentence that they refer to under the Act, starts out by stating; \"SUBJECT  TO ANY EXPRESS PROVISION IN ANOTHER ACT, \"....blah,blah, blah (you know the rest). Most people reading this sentence,( if they knew where to look and what to look for) would not know and fail to understand what it really meant, and would think it to be meaningless Legal Gibberish. If one breaks down the sentence, it's quite simple;\n\n            Ques:   What does \"Subject To\" mean?   Ans:  Anyone who has bought or sold real estate knows, any present or former real estate agents know, any first year law student knows, any lawyer engaged in  real estate conveyancing knows,  most if not all lawyers know. Most English speaking, moderately intelligent people in the world know what it means, its an \"ESCAPE CLAUSE\".It would appear however, that certain so called crown prosecutors  have never heard of this Legal Phrase and don’t know it’s true meaning, and they claim to have gone to law school(  were they asleep during classes).\n\n            Ques:   What does \" Any Express Provision\" mean?    Ans:    Anything Expressly Provided.  Ques:  What is Expressly Provided ?  Ans: \"Permission\" must be Expressly Provided. Ques: by who or what must this Permission be Expressly provided by?     Ans.  Hold on it’s\ncoming.\n\n             Ques:   What does \"In Another Act\" mean\"?      Ans:  In Another Act      Ques:   What other Act?       Ans: The Traffic Safety Act, this Permission is to be expressly provided by the Alberta Transportation Safety Board, THATS WHO.\n\nI maintain that the Best Place To Hide Anything is in \"PLAIN SIGHT\", especially if you wish to Confuse, Lie To, Cheat, and otherwise Rip Off People, who don't know any law and certainly don't know how to defend themselves against these so called crown prosecutors, who are deliberately out to take advantage of them. The phrase that I have been referring to, “SUBJECT TO ANY EXPRESS PROVISION IN ANOTHER ACT” is located in the FIRST PART, of the FIRST SENTENCE, of the FIRST REAL PARAGRAPH( being sec. 2), in the Provincial Offenses Procedure Act. This is just part of the MASSIVE FRAUD(and there’s more) being practiced in the Provincial Court (Traffic). I would ask at this time that that you support my Call For and Demand, that the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Transportation and the Premier of Alberta appoint a PUBLIC INQUIRY into the Fraudulent Operations of the Provincial Court of Alberta (Traffic) and into the Fraudulent Conduct of the so called crown prosecutors, the Traffic Court Commissioners and the police who operate this Criminal Enterprise. Further that all Present and Future Prosecutions in the Provincial Court (Traffic) be Suspended pending the Outcome of this Public Inquiry.  If your interested in knowing more about these issues, give me a call at Res. 000 000 0000, Cell. 000 000 0000.        DON’T BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT\n I’VE JUST SAID,      CHECK IT OUT YOURSELF.          \n\nRegards ,  XXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXX "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_661757750526827","body":"fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_661738753862060","body":"Get it ? .......... :P\n\n hdwalldownloads.com hdwalldownloads.com "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_661728420529760","body":"The Great Leap Backward: Criminal Law Reform with the Hon Jarrod Bleijie\n\n http://sydney.edu.au/law/slr/slr_36/slr36_1/SLRv36n1TrotterHobbs.pdf sydney.edu.au "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_661382813897654","body":"The following court transcript supports our long and on-going arguement concerning Common Law and Citizen's Common Law Rights: \nAccessed: Saturday, 3rd May 2014.\nAvailable:  DPP v Hamilton - [2011] VSC 598 - 33 VR 505 - BarNet Jade jade.barnet.com.au DPP v Hamilton - [2011] VSC 598 - DPP v Hamilton (25 November 2011) - [2011] VSC 598 (25 November 2011) (KAYE J) - 33 VR 505 "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_659430620759540","body":"Wanted to see what Scott thought of this article!!!!

Please provide a certified copy of the contract which validates the debt claimed to be owed to your agency.\n\n2. Please identify yourself to me as outlined above. I require government issued photographic identification. This measure must be taken to prevent fraud.\n\n3. Understand that I DO accept phone calls regarding the matter at a rate of $3500 per call attempt.\n\n4. Understand that unsigned offers shall constitute harassment and an administrative fee of $1500 shall be imposed for each unsigned offer received.\n\n5. Understand that, as I am acting in good faith, any negative reporting to any agency/credit bureau is unwarranted and tantamount to FRAUD. Any reporting to an agency/credit bureau shall incur a fee of $5500 applicable to you.\n\n6. Provide me with a BILL as well as specific instructions as to how to execute the provided instrument and DISCHARGE the debt via the PERSONS SURETY.\n\nFailure to provide me with a valid CONTRACT as well as identify yourself will leave me with no option but to assume you are a third party interloper making a FALSE CLAIM against me.

Am I responsible for making sure you stay within the limits of your authority, even if you are unaware of what those limits are? Please show me documentation of your authority. Is it true that the authority of an FBI agent is the same as the authority of a Park Ranger? \n\nDid you swear an \"Oath of Office\" ? \n\nPlease show me a copy of it. If you violate your Oath of Office, what are the consequences to you? How are those consequences enforced? Do I have to complain to your superiors, or sue you, or what? What is the name of your superior? What is your badge number? Are you authorized to use an alias? How can I serve process on you if I don't know your real name? \n\nWhen you took office, did you file a bond? Is there any liability insurance to cover damage that you cause while on duty? \n\nPlease show me a copy of the insurance policy. \n\nAre you here on campus as an \"invitee\" or as a \"licensee\" ? How does that affect the liability of the Trustees if you are injured while here? How does that affect the liability of the Trustees if you cause damage? Which program are you here under: Applicant, Civil Rights, Counterterrorism, Financial Crime, Foreign Counterintelligence, Organized Crime/Drug, or Violent Crimes and Major Offenders? \n\nIs it true that if you arrest me, and I sue you for false arrest (also false imprisonment, assault, battery, and kidnapping), the only thing I need to prove is that an arrest occurred, and then the burden is on you to show that it wasn't false? Would I sue you in State or Federal court? Why? Is it true that \"imprisonment\" includes \"restraining me of my liberty by words and acts which I fear to disregard\" ? Is it true that you can conduct a warrantless arrest only if you witness a felony or a breach of the peace, the same as any citizen? Please show me documentation of any other powers of arrest. \n\nWhat is the Constitutional authority for the FBI to exist? Is it true that the \"police power\" means the power to protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the public? Is it true that the police powers are reserved to the States under the 10th Amendment? How can you call yourself \"law enforcement\" if you're not exercising the police power? Is it true that the only Federal crimes (under Article I of the Constitution) are counterfeiting, piracy and treason? If you're not exercising police powers, and you're not a standing army, then what are you? \n\nIs it true that Congress technically ceased to exist during the Civil War, by adjourning \"sine die\" (\"without day\")? Is this the reason that Congress has not used the Constitutionally mandated procedure for admitting any States to the Union since 1859?\n\nIs this the reason Senators and Representatives are not actually sworn in during \"swearing-in\" ceremonies? Is this the reason the President calls the Congress into session every two years? Why two years? Is it because the salaries of Congress fall under the two-year limit on military appropriations? \n\nAre there geographical limits to your authority? Please show me documentation of those limits. Are you authorized to operate in one of the 10 Federal \"Regions\" ? What is the Constitutional authority for the Nixon-era creation of those \"Regions\" ? How can the Federal government create \"Regions\" if it is forbidden to create States? Was it done through emergency or martial-law powers? Isn't \"Region\" a military word? \n\nDo you have any reason to believe that any of us are engaging in interstate commerce?\n\nDo you know that any mention of the “interstate commerce clause” in any court, by the Prosecution or the Plaintiff, brings the Constitution into evidence and I am free to use it OR object on the grounds that the Constitution has not been entered into evidence.\n\nDo you know Lon Horiuchi, who shot Vicki Weaver while she was holding a baby in her arms (in the infamous Ruby Ridge incident), all over a shotgun that was a quarter of an inch too short? Do you know the agent who shot 14-year-old Sammy Weaver in the back as he tried to run home? \n\nDid you have any part in the Waco massacre (in which the FBI used CS gas and its flammable propellant, in a surprise attack with no element of surprise)? Isn't CS gas illegal to use in war? Did you help destroy evidence from Waco? Is it true that the U.S. Marshals Service falsely claimed a possible drug problem with the Weavers at Ruby Ridge in order to get military reconnaissance flights over the cabin? (and the \"hot spot\" from the alleged drug lab turned out to be a doghouse?) And that the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms invented a phony drug nexus at Waco in order to obtain massive assistance from the U.S. Army, the Texas National Guard, and the Alabama National Guard? Is it true that civilian agencies routinely obtain free military support by lying about drugs, and because there is no sanction for lying, obvious falsehoods are accepted by the military as a pretext for intervention? Is it true that the infamous FBI Hostage Rescue Team has spent considerable time in recent years holding hostages and has not even attempted to rescue a hostage for several years? Why are there 56 FBI SWAT teams and what's that got to do with investigation? \n\nIs it true that almost the entire Waco operation, not only 2/28 but the siege, had been improperly financed from money that law enforcement was supposed to use only in the war on drugs? \n\nHave you had any military training? Are you connected in any way to military intelligence? How come you're not covered by the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which was passed to outlaw the use of federal troops for civilian law enforcement and which made it a felony to willfully use \"any part of the Army . . . to execute the laws\" ? \n\nIs it true that during the 1930s J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, falsely told the American people that an unprecedented wave of child kidnappings was in progress, and the FBI was rewarded with substantial attention and funding, and in the 1980s a very different FBI earned itself more funding by putting out phony claims about a wave of serial killers of children? \n\nIs it really a federal crime to transport artificial teeth into a state without the approval of a local licensed dentist, with penalty of up to one year in prison? Is this the sort of thing we pay the FBI to investigate? \n\nIs it true that the federal courts have virtually taken over such vital state functions as the operation of prisons and mental hospitals? And that by 1993, the federal courts operated 80 percent of all state prison systems in America? Is it true that federal judges determine virtually every detail of these prisons, including standards for food and clothing, grievance procedures, and cell space per convict? Is it true that these prisons are run by private corporations for profit?\n\nTOP THINGS THE BANKS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW\n\nDid you know that the FDIC doesn't really insure bank accounts? \n\nDid you know that when a bank goes under and is taken over by the FDIC, instead of paying the $100,000, the FDIC just pays its own people to come into the bank and divvy up what's left of the bank's assets? (This comes from a woman who once worked as a temp for the FDIC. Her job was to talk on the phone to the angry depositors and explain this to them.) \n\nDid you know that a bank cannot legally require a fingerprint as a condition of cashing a check? \nAccording to UCC 3-501(b)(2), they can only require you to: \nExhibit the instrument (i.e. you show them the check) \nGive reasonable identification, and evidence of your authority if you are cashing the check on behalf of someone else \nSign the check, and make a written receipt for partial payment, or the surrender of the check upon full payment (i.e. you let them keep the check) \nThey write the brochures to say that they \"ask\" for a fingerprint (not \"demand\" as a condition of payment). Their excuse for the fingerprint is \"reasonable identification.\" So if you can get them to agree that your picture ID is reasonable identification, they have NO LAWFUL EXCUSE for refusing to pay the check just because you don't give them a fingerprint! In this case they have \"dishonored\" the check and you can proceed exactly as you would if they blatantly, and for no reason, refused to pay. Contact us for ideas on how to use the fingerprint issue. \n\nDid you know that if you write “Without Recourse” below your endorsement or signature that the bank can not take any action against you for any reason!\n\nDid you know that banks do not loan their own assets, nor the assets of their depositors? \nDo you realize this means they do NOT loan money, but instead, there is an exchange of credit for credit, in which interest is charged on one side, but not the other? \nIf the borrower walks away with cash (which has value in the form of \"purchasing power\"), but the bank didn't loan any of its assets, isn't it obvious that the \"purchasing power\" must have come from SOMEWHERE? \n\nDid you know that when a bank makes a \"loan,\" the money supply (M1) expands -- in other words, the volume of currency in circulation increases? \n\nDid you know that the value of the Federal Reserve Note \"dollar\" depends on the size of the money supply via the law of \"supply and demand\" -- in other words, the more FRNs there are, the less they are worth? \n\nDo you understand that when the bank makes a loan, the value of the FRN \"dollar bills\" in everybody's pocket declines -- in other words, the bank is creating FRN dollars in competition with the FRN \"dollars\" in your pocket, and this reduces the value of the FRN \"dollars\" in your pocket? Do you realize this is the cause of inflation? \n\nDo you realize that this means the \"value,\" or \"purchasing power,\" loaned by the bank is essentially STOLEN from the public via the mechanism of inflation? Contact us for ideas on how to use the \"Theft by Inflation\" issue\n\n1. Always Pursue Truth - unless something better comes along.\n\n2. There is No Deception so great as-- Self-deception, see # 1.

This piece of paper authorized another person (BIG WIG) to be surety and/or confiscate WAGES negotiated in good faith (they used weasel words).\n\nBIG WIG and the ONION (Organized Labor crying a lot) have a contract of which I am the beneficiary. I as a private man have no agreement with any other person for wage confiscation.\n\nBIG WIG and the ONION (a trust which the person is a beneficiary of) are very powerful ENTITIES with INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION. oh well :) \n\nI decided to to ask a few questions of the payroll department at BIG WIG and the werent very forthcoming with answers. In fact they made some very serious claims and allegations and barred my from my rights. I made it very clear that the matter at hand was a private matter and that they should forward any remittances in their possession to the address on file.\n\nI asked if they had endorsed any papers on my behalf and they said yes and if I failed to earn enough to satisfy the alleged debt in that tax year they would apply to renew the CONTRACT. OK, so now I'm mad like a meme and inform payroll that I am sole signing authority for the name and any interference in my private affairs and signing on my behalf is cause for a bill.\n\nGuess the payroll dept felt that I was going to kill people in their office be cause they took this very private matter to the ONION and made it public. \n\nI guess they misunderstood my intent to hold any individual and/or to personto account if they continue to interfere with my only right.\n\nBIG WIG sent my person and the ONION HQ a letter and a pile of POLICY about workplace harassment. This letter is defamatory and a serious infringement upon my one and only right. They have destroyed my credibility by publicly stating they are only following the law (just like the nazi's) and that I may confront some one physically in their office. They failed to send an affidavit that I in fact threatened anyone physically or that there is even any evidence of work place harassment in my history and or file. \n\nWell I too have a policy and I could careless what the ONION and BIG WIG think. \n\nI know I still think wrong but fuck it, there is a war coming and I have an oath to protect the members of the ONION, I'm sure they will choose self destruction (conditioned to the bounty of over 40 debt notes to the hour and the apathy it creates) rather than be like the men and women that started the ONION (they cry a lot) 130 years ago. \n\nThe ONION is bankrupt and BIG WIG is flush with DOH, both will pay the price, one for breach of trust and the other for failing to abide by my policy.\n\nMy will is to not harm anyone, my will is to see damages repaired.

We hear comments and arguments citing the \"live\" birth certificate, the registered birth certificate, legal currency, social contracts, first names, last names, names in \"Capitis Diminutio Maxima\", and probably at some point the correlation of giving birth in the desert while viewing a sunning lizzard.  There are individuals and teams pouring over historical documents, legal documents or simply looking for secret words or mystery themes in every day documents.\n\nNone of these conversations relate to my point, though.\n\nIn contract law (and how can this be about anything else where there is no injured party), there are two or more parties who enter into an agreement with knowledge and understanding.  If written properly all parties are aware of the responsibilities and surety attached to the terms and conditions - including the penalties for non-performance.  If \"social contracts\" exist would it not be reasonable for all participants to enter into the agreement with full clarity?  \n\nIf you need to go looking for the secret signals that have obligated you to terms and conditions, or if the parties \"enforcing\" your contractual obligations are unwilling or unable to illustrate the point at which you made an informed decision, are you obligated to perform to the contractual specifications?\n\nThere are two possible scenarios that could play out in your quest for the mystery joinder.  \n\nIn one scenario you spend your entire life looking, and find nothing.  On your deathbed you lament you have wasted your life and are no further ahead.\n\nIn the other scenario:\nLet's say you one day find the secret, hidden, list of words or sentences, the \"holy grail of joinder, if you will\", at the bottom of a well, enclosed in plastic, and signed by someone you have never met on behalf of all humanity.  Eureka!  Then what do you do?  Do you chant the secret words of non-joinder?  Do you appeal to an amorphous cloud of  bureaucratic haze?  On hearing your revelations, do people and organizations immediately stop victimizing you or taking your stuff?  \n\nWhat do you hope to gain by immersing yourself in what is colloquially referred to as \"club-house\" rules?

I was there at 9:30 prior to our heroes being escorted into the courtroom. When they came in Lange was in a red prison jumpsuit and Smith in the suit he was wearing when he was tossed into the pit Friday afternoon. Smith gave his magic incantation as he crossed through the remand doorway into the court then gave me a cheery wave before sitting down. The first thing Crown counsel did was inform the court that Lange wanted to talk to the duty counsel, essentially legal aid. However issues over that. If he'd had the sense to want duty counsel assistance last Friday there would have been no problem. An astute young lawyer was right there in our court ready and willing to take on the job. But today there were difficulties, it was List Day. That was a new term to me, turned out to be the processing of all the miscreants arrested over the weekend and now facing a judge on Monday morning. Duty counsel had to be there to help represent them. Since Lange was a \"regular\" prisoner being held during the term of a trial he was at the end of the line behind the List Day mob so our trial would have to wait for his services unless the judge ordered a priority in which case duty counsel would dump the List Day riff-raff and hurry on over.\n\nJudge asked the Crown what they wanted to do. Crown counsel said she had a non-controversial initial witness who could be put on while waiting for the duty counsel. The two Daves were good with it so we got at least one witness in before their capitulation.\n\nThe Crown started by recapping events leading to arrest. Our heroes trying to enter the courts in November and December 2012 under the guise of being Peace Officers and their attempts to get a metal shop to make them a bunch of phony Peace Officer's badges.\n\nThen it was time for the witness, a woman from Victoria who was a supervisor in the Victoria court Sheriff service. (A note here - I copied her name down when she said it on the stand but wasn't sure if I got it right so I quizzed her in the lobby after testimony. However for some reason she refused to give it to a scruffy old stranger badgering her for personal information at a high security trial with a bunch of defendants known for harassing court officials. After thinking it over I realized she had a point, her name is irrelevant to the accurate recording of events so I'll leave it out). She was just proving some documents. All she did was hand over documents into evidence after identifying them as documents given to her by her staff after having received them from the defendants in November and December 2012. I think they were the fake Peace Officer certificates purportedly notarized by the Chief. Lange cross examined her first. Just asked her if she had personally seen him serving the documents on the Sheriffs. Not in November but in the December incident she was present and saw him pressing the documents on the Sheriffs. Then Smith's turn and he went Full Freeman right out the gate;\n\nSmith - Do you work for the province of British Columbia?\nWitness - Yes.\nSmith - Are you aware that the province of British Columbia is a bankrupt corporation?\nWitness - Huh? Don't understand what you are talking about.\nSmith - Are you aware that the Province of British Columbia is a bankrupt corporation owned by (I think he said) the American government or treasury?\n\nThe witness was apparently confused as to what this had to do with some documents she'd entered into evidence. Judge told her to just answer yes or no to the question whether she worked for a corporation. So, no. I work for the province of British Columbia. Then Smith asked (I think, poor audio) if she had to follow corporate policies. Judge - answer yes, no, or I don't know.\n\nSmith - When you were made a sheriff did you take a statutory oath to the corporation of British Columbia?\nWitness - I took an oath for the province of British Columbia\nSmith - Are you sure?\nWitness - Yes.\n\nAfter this nonsense was done duty counsel still MIA. Crown counsel said that the next witness was an RCMP officer specializing in Freemen who would give factual evidence about events so it might be a good idea to have a lawyer for Lange if he planned to continue with counsel. So at 10:30 Court adjourned until they could round up duty counsel. At that point I assumed that Lange was bailing and wanted a lawyer to help negotiate a deal. Since his \"Special appearance\" bullshit on Friday, far from being a magic pass out of trouble, had resulted in the judge ordering a week in jail I thought that maybe Lange was reconsidering. Maybe his wife had talked some sense into him on the weekend. Just guesses on my part.\n\nI hung around in the lobby and chatted with the 77 year old commissionaire at the information desk about the trial and he asked who the judge was. I said I didn't know so he pulled out the list to look it up. This was when I found out why I couldn't locate the courtroom on Friday. While this was not an in camera hearing it was apparently a super-secret unlisted hearing not on the daily docket. Even the registrar didn't have it. I was just lucky I'd seen Smith wandering by.\n\nAt noon we were told to come back at 2:00. Something was obviously up. Back at two but we just sat around in the courtroom until three with no defendants or judge. When duty counsel showed up and our two boys were brought in the duty counsel conferred with both of them so it looked like Smith was onboard for representation too. Turned out they had both cut a deal with the Crown during the break and were changing their pleas to guilty. Duty Counsel said he had reviewed it, seemed ok to him, and then he hurried off to be with his first love, List Day. Crown said that they had made identical plea bargain agreements and the terms were;\n\n1 - All charges except impersonating Peace Officers dropped. They were to plead guilty to that.\n\n2 - Each defendant to get 21 day jail term. Smith off on time already served. Lange 8 days short.\n\n3 - Twelve Months unsupervised probation. Agreed terms of probation were;\n- No contact or communication with any other member of the Fabulous Fighting Five Freemen.\n- No contact or communication with the person who signed the Peace Officer's Oath as a\nclaimed notary (hi Chief!)\n- Keep the peace (A loaded term!) and be of good behavior during term of probation\n- Not possess badges, cards, letters or certificates that might give them the appearance of\nbeing Peace Officers\n- not attend any court sessions except their own. If they were involved in any court sessions\nthey were to identify themselves properly and conduct themselves in a manner acceptable to\nthe courts. Crown counsel said they put this provision in because of Smith's Friday hissy-fit.\n\nJudge was willing to accept the agreement and asked both defendants if they agreed to these terms. Yes except for a slight quibble by both. They were fine with the no-contact with the Chief, Ream, Simpson and Valliant but wanted to be able to associate with each other. Apparently they worked together from time to time in the plumbing/heating business and wanted to continue. Crown agreed. Judge then asked Crown if a fine would be preferable to the eight days to be served by Lange. Crown didn't seem happy with idea but it didn't matter because when the judge offered Lange the choice of jail or a $1,500 fine he picked jail. Since Lange worked, or was trying to get work, judge allowed sentence to be served on weekends. Judge also waived Victim Surcharge fine. When all this done judge asked our defendants once again if the agreed to the deal. Yes. Did they have anything to say before final sentencing. No.\n\nWhen he read out the terms he phrased the no contact with the Chief as \"no contact or communication, directly or indirectly, with the individual purportedly a 'notary' going under the names of Sino General and/or Chief Rock and/or Hajistahenhway.\" Judge had problems with the pronunciation of Hajistahenhway. Crown counsel of no help with that one. So we finally got down to business at three and everything concluded by four. As a result I was saved from viewing a parade of witnesses droning on for the rest of the week. Works for me.\nAs always, I forgot to mention something. Probably a couple more of these to come yet. Crown Counsel gave a short song and dance at sentencing about why our felonious freemen should get the book thrown at them (21 times greater jail sentence than Simpson!). They brought up the fact that the \"Fighting For Us All\" Freeman Five (I'm being generous here on my interpretation of the Crown's position on their capabilities) seemed to be somewhat more or less organized and with the apparent ability to occasionally actually act in concert. A somewhat unique event in Canadian Freemanistan considering that most of them seem incapable of organizing a one-man pub crawl. I'll go out on a limb and say that I think if I gave Menard $50 he could handle at least that.\n\nOne piece of evidence that the Crown gave as proof of their professional expertise in being able to act together as an organized team in pursuit of a common goal was the series of videos that Mowe linked to and now, sadly, deleted. You remember; the ones taken in happier, more optimistic times, when they showed the world graphic proof that they could all get into one vehicle together and drive to a location entirely different than the one the video started at. No wonder the Crown fears their latent capabilities!

They know THAT their frauds work, but they don't know why.  I, on the other hand, know that frauds work; and I know why they work.  A fraud artist does not.\n\nBelow you will see an article by the James Randi Educational Foundation showing examples of deception with no personal gain.  The people who do these sorts of things are the ones that are predisposed to commit frauds against others.  The same guy that puts up the giant squid washing up on the beach in California, has an identical mindset to those committing the sub-prime mortgage frauds.   These people exploit the very programming I am fighting.  My familiar ancestors are responsible for all of this, but they're dead now so they can't really be called to account.  \n\nYou are quite literally programmed from beyond the grave.\n\nWhen I was thirteen I laid my claim to the Trust that caused all of this.  I am not one of them, and I am not one of you; but I certainly don't stand alone.  My own personal feelings and this Trust to which I have dedicated a lifetime's work, are constantly at odds.  It would be so easy for me to turn on all of you and take everything. \n\nSo I guess the question is, \"Why don't I?\"  I have a long list of failures, from light-weights like Derek Moran (circle-jerking to clubhouse rules), to Robert Menard choosing fraud over trust to...the strange pattern that seems to indicate that anyone named \"Andrew\" is functionally useless, to the people who are actually doing everything in their power to sabotage my initiatives.\n\nAs I've stated before there is no \"secret\" knowledge around here.  I'll never charge anybody money for the time I use to impart this knowledge.  And quite frankly, I'm in a better position than anybody because I know how everything works.  Unlike all the gurus out there charging money, I actually know the answers, and am doing something about it.\n\nIt would be so much easier for me to exploit the knowledge I have for my own personal gain.  So again, \"Why don't I?\"\n\nThe answer is simple - Aquilae, a trust for which I am the keeper.  People TRUST me.  This is something I ponder all the time.  A trust cannot have debt; and from a bookkeeping perspective the TRUSTEES owe me substantially more than I owe them.  I often wonder to myself why it is that I find the idea of betraying their trust so horrifying.  Those that know me know that I have rather \"binary\" emotions.  I'm either angry, or I'm not angry.  I am happy, or I am not happy.  There is no middle ground.  I know from a personal standpoint that I could kill a justice in the most horrifying way and feel nothing.  So why don't I?  It's not as though side-stepping government workers would be a big challenge.  To a lesser extent all of you TRUST me, but that's only because I provide you with actual answers.  \n\nI'm sure there are more than a few of you out there that are thinking, \"What's the catch\"?  I have even explained that.  All of you are part of a larger mechanism, and I've made no secret of the fact that I intend to collapse the banking system and start a war.  I also intend to eliminate all the participants in the most spectacularly horrifying ways.  \n\nAnd I intend to do it legally and lawfully - without breaching the TRUST.  I mean harm to all fraud artists, be it in the government or the private sector. I'm coming for all of you; and as you can see I've not been quiet about it.\n\nThe Law Society destroyed a lifetime's work, and interrupted my life plan, and I intend to return the favour.  \n\nOne of the possible scenarios is that I could end up in charge...of everything (note: if that happens I shall issue a degree that all legal matters are to be handled by realestate agents).  But...I hope that doesn't happen, because there will be public executions in Nathan Phillips Square.  \n\nLet's examine the tactical situation.  I'm the Admiral.  Everybody sees me.  I am the \"public face\", and I tend to raise more questions than I answer simply by telling the truth.  Several thousand posts ago I mentioned the sure-fire way to rob a jewelry store without getting caught: set off a nuke on the other side of town and nobody will give a shit about the jeweler.  I am that nuke!  I am who the \"Powers that Be\" are focused on, which means they're focused on the wrong thing.  \n\nHow does this relate to TRUST?  Think of all those that have \"boots on the ground\".  The people that intend to rob the jeweler store are dependent on the nuke to make their plans feasible.  They TRUST the nuke to the point where they can rely on it.  And all of this is happening in plain sight, and all that can be connected to it is some crazy guy on the internet in a secret Facebook group. \n\n If a \"law enforcement official\" questions any of you about \"Admiral Scott\" be sure to tell them...tell them everything.  Because anyone who asks that question is attempting to sabotage my initiative, but they're government workers, so of course they're focused on the wrong thing.  Just like the rest of you.\n \n It's not your fault, you were programmed that way.  You are programmed to believe in \"imaginary sky daddies\" (that we invented).  You are programmed to believe that people in costumes have magic powers, and you're programmed to believe that there are some magical words that you can say that will get the government off your back.  You go looking for answers from the Dean Cliffords and Robert Menards of the world and end up spending a lot of time, effort and money, on half-truths, non-answers and the ever-present hope of them revealing their \"secrets\".  \n \n I don't have any secret knowledge, at least nothing that pertains to you.  In THE TENDER FOR LAW and THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING, you have limited access to all of my knowledge, but only if you ask the right questions.  Government workers are asking these questions right now.  I'm not one of these fucking FREE-DUMBERS.  Contracts are LAW.  They are a TRUST.  If one of the parties in that contract, or TRUSTEES, breached that contract, it is my right to detach myself from said contract as it is in fact VOID.  If I'm told I own something, then I fucking own it.  There's no such thing as conditional ownership unless you agree.  I pay all my taxes.  I pay all my bills.  But the system is broken, and there's nothing I can do about that.  Except prove it.\n \nFor the past five years I have documented absolutely everything.  I can substantiate every single one of my claims to the point where it is irrefutable.  I know that the only way any of these people will ever be called to account is if they're beaten to death on the street, and that is my eventual goal.  It won't come from anything that I have published, or will publish...that will just be the spark that ignites the fuse.  All of this will happen simply by telling the truth.\n\nThis comes at high personal cost, and every day I ponder slitting a lawyer's throat, or torturing them for days inside a shipping container; but that would breach the TRUST which I have sworn to uphold.  \n\nThis makes me better than every government worker that has ever existed.\n\nThis is what the nobility should be.  The nobility is called \"privileged\" and has higher standing because the people are supposed to TRUST them.  I also know that I'm a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far, just like you, so I must remain forever vigilant.  \n\nNobody stomps on a burning bag of shit anymore.  Frauds need to be as complex as the one that deceived you in the first place.  The cornerstone of this mechanism is to get ignorant third-parties to endorse the fraud.  This is very effective if MOST of what they are saying is true.  The masters of this, like Robert Menard, lie through omission.  I can say with the utmost certainty that none of you knew what THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER meant before you came here. \n\n None of this is hidden.  You all think wrong, and value the wrong things.  It's not your fault, you were programmed that way.  You are blind people who swear you can see.  Stop assisting the fraud.  Stop spreading fraud.  Anyone who claims to have \"secret knowledge\" is a fraud.  Right now you guys are practicing on DOGE coin.  If this were a math class you'd be learning to add right now; and I need to get you up to the level where you can do advanced calculus.  Those who are actually paying attention and listening to me will notice that I always give away the answer at the beginning.  At a higher level fractal that's the same as the Great American novel.  I tell you what you're going to read, then I let you know you're reading it, then I tell you what you just read.  I choose the authoring style of the dumbest population on the planet - Americans.  It doesn't matter if you live in Canada; you just have a watered-down version of the American system.  When you do things from the rather humiliating perspective of dumb programmed chimp, who is finally being told the truth, you will find this much easier and actually fun to do.\n \n Ask Pete, because unlike the rest of you who think I'm \"egotistical\" and \"arrogant\", people like Pete see reality.  I'm sure Pete will confirm this.  When you realize you're a dumb programmed chimp, you will also realize you don't want to be a dumb programmed chimp.  Every time I hear accusations of \"crazy\", \"arrogant\", and/or \"egotistical\", all my brain receives is \"I want to be a dumb programmed chimp\", and \"I'm proud to be a dumb programmed chimp, and so are all the other readers\".  \n \n Indirectly these people mean you harm.  You're just too dumb and programmed to see it.  The tingly sensation people feel in the group is me eliminating people who mean you harm, because you're not aware enough to do anything about it yourself.  I should point out that this is not an invitation to have a bunch of \"guru videos\" thrown at me with the question, \"What do you think of this?\"  Above all, what I think is really none of your fucking business.\n \n Focus on what I'm telling you, and stop spreading fraud.

The results? How about jail time, a foreclosure (it took them 3 years to get it) and hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on ATTORNey fees. When the money would run out, I’d fire the useless cunt attorneys and take the actions over myself (another useless cunt – I know…). I’ve had some small victories yes, but when the time came to “get actual remedy” nope. They’d crush me like a grape. I was SURETY and their LEDGER needed my blood to be squared up. I remember making hour long statements in court – for what? \n\nIt got to the point where I pretty much knew everyone at the Edmonton court house. File this, motion that, application for this – stand there ARGUING my points. Why did I most always LOOSE? Because when you MAKE STATEMENTS and/or ANSWER QUESTIONS/BE DEPOSED you are in DISHONOR and the justice will most ALWAYS side with his bar brothers (who also argue). There are ways to make the justices honest and neutral, but I have yet to achieve this in open court. I have the balls to assert it, but the opportunity has not come up. I’ve managed to stay the fuck out of there – THEY DON’T CARE and I NO LONGER CARE EITHER.\n\nNext time I’m dragged into court in shackles, I will BE the notice of mistake, no need to FILE anything. That’s a promise and PUBLIC NOTICE, you can count on it. Should I go to fail, their will be repercussions. The trust holding LEGAL title to my juristic person will come forward and hold those public servants accountable. Isn't that’s what their bonds are for?\n\n\"THEY DONT FUCKING CARE\". Let's look at that for a moment. That is indeed a FACT.\n\nWhy don't they care? Humm...\n\nIs SURETY still presumed to be the fellow/TRUSTEE standing in THEIR courtroom?\n\nIsn’t it a FACT that only TRUSTEEs go to jail? \n\nWas a statement(s) made or a question answered which leads THEM to attach surety AND/OR jurisdiction to the fellow? Better think twice about that one…\n \nIt is one thing to FILE the notice of mistake; it is another thing to ENFORCE the intent behind the notice of mistake. How bad do you NOT wish to be surety?\n\nStatements = Dishonor\n\nBeing deposed = loss of Sovereignty = THEY get jurisdiction = you ARE the trustee\n\nSince when do grantors and beneficiaries of TRUSTS obey commands? Is court NOT a constructive trust and is the legal person NOT a government created trust of which YOU are the beneficiary?\n\nWhat would happen is THEY ALLOWED the fellow standing in the courtroom to NOT be surety? Who gets the bill? Is it the ATTORNey? And you THINK they are going to allow that to happen so easily?\n\nI could go on and on, but at the end of the day, do you know who you are and do you know what YOUR RIGHTS ARE? Legal persons HAVE NO RIGHTS, THAT’s WHY THEY DON’T GIVE A FUCK.\n\nSo what are you gonna do? Yell, scream and moan like a little bitch? Cower before your enemy? Get yanked out the courtroom in total dishonor like the angry slave you appear to be? \n\nOr are you gonna educate yourself and calmly ask questions designed to publicly EXPOSE what’s really going on in there? SURETY AND ACCOUNTING.\n\nWho are you gonna be and what are you gonna do?\n\nAnyway, that’s my 2 cents, take it or leave it.

I don't have to post \"evidence\". I'm not trying to PROVE anything to you.\n\nThat said, this is not a debate centre either. You assume ALL LIABILITY when you ask to join this group. This, by default, means you have \"SURETY\", because SURETY equals LIABILITY. I don't need to provide \"proof\" of this; as my banning you from the group should be compelling enough to show the difference between who's in charge, and who's liable.\n\nBefore we get to the actual issue of SURETY, and why you must avoid it, we must take a quick journey back in time to learn where the legalese that enjoins you came from.\n\nThose of you who endured the content-free 1.2 decades of the Public Fool System, will remember certain things, not the least of which is Shakespeare. The plays of Shakespeare are sold to you as \"Olde English\". In fact, it was sold as \"Olde English\" when these were first-run plays. There is a problem with this, though. Nobody ever spoke in the manner that Shakespeare wrote, and they most certainly never used the words. Shakespeare produced most of his major works between 1589 and 1613, all of which were sold as \"Olde English\". Popular periodicals of the time show that you were often considered \"learned and of good taste\" if you could speak in this \"Olde English\".\n\nSo let's go read some really, really Olde English.\n\nLet's pick a really old English document, completely at random. We'll pick...The MAGNA CARTA.\n\nA quick read of the MAGNA CARTA will swiftly reveal two things. The first is that that it's pretty readable, not backward and convoluted like a Shakespeare play. There may be a few archaic words you may need to look up (to ascertain their meanings), but it's still pretty readable, and there are no words that Shakespeare used. There's also no letter \"U\". This is a very important fact to remember, because *spoiler alert*, when courts or legal documents refer to \"YOU\", they are in fact, granting you SURETY in the matter. If you look at a WARRANT, or a ticket from a Policy Enforcement Officer, it will have a name and it will then refer to that name as \"YOU\" from then on. For example, \"JOHN Q PUBLIC, YOU have been charged with (insert bullshit offence here)\".\n\nYOU=SURETY\n\nIf you're ever in a courtroom and do not wish to have the \"benefit of SURETY\", you have but to object to being addressed as \"YOU\". There are many ways to do this. Dean Clifford might say, in response to being addressed as \"YOU\", \"If I have led the court to believe that I am SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me.\" (FUN FACT: A court MUST ALWAYS grant forgiveness when asked and/or requested)\n\nOthers, like myself, are a lot more succinct. For example, I might respond, \"FUCK YOU! You're a YOU, I'm a ME! By what AUTHORITY do YOU address ME as a \"YOU\"?\", because I can get away with it. The reason I can get away with it is that I UNDERSTAND the UCC as opposed to ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD which spreads mythology and bullshit about the UCC.\n\nNow there may be a certain \"pretend radio\" talk-show host (who speaks in a manner that would suggest he is hosting a show with a dick in his mouth), who would demand \"proof of this\", ignoring the fact that the UCC is, in fact, the proof.\n\nSection 1, Subsection 308, of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE covers RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. This is a well-known fact, and this is how you use it.\n\nOn entering the court, you aggressively make the first motion, that being, the RESERVATION OF YOUR RIGHTS. But since you're the only one in the courtroom with ACTUAL STANDING, you can be a total dick about it. You don't RESERVE YOUR RIGHTS, you RESERVE ALL RIGHTS! Not just yours, EVERYONE's. You remove everyone else's rights and give them to yourself. WHY? Because \"Fuck off that's WHY!\" You're the only one with STANDING.\n\nIf you HOLD the power, WIELD it...don't be such a pussy! If you're entitled to ALL RIGHTS, CLAIM THEM. This is how you do it.\n\nWhen the \"justice\" starts speaking, interrupt them. Say, \"Point of order!\" They will immediately be silent. At that point, state \"I believe I am the only party with standing, so barring objection from the court, I wish to RESERVE ALL RIGHTS now, and henceforth. Are there any objections from the court?\" As the court has no standing to respond, simply speak to the record as such, \"Let the record show that I have reserved all rights, and the court has not objected.\" At this point if they say anything to you, you simply say, \"Objection. The record shows that I have reserved all rights, and I have not granted you leave to speak. Why are you speaking?\"\n\nDo the same when opposing counsel attempts to speak. You will then be posed the question, \"How do you wish to proceed in this matter?\" for that is the one question a slave has the right to ask. What is their master's wish?\n\nYou'll recall in other articles and comments, the levels of the caste system and how they give instructions.\n\nNOBILITY (KINGS AND QUEENS) EXPRESS THEIR \"WISHES\".\n\nADMIRALTY ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS BY REQUESTING, ADDRESSING THEIR SUBORDINATES AS \"MR\".\n\nGENERALS GIVE ORDERS.\n\nNow even the talk-show host who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth, won't \"demand proof\" of the fact that if you have all the rights, and everybody else has none, you are CLEARLY the KING. So you are going to have to learn to give instruction by expressing your wishes. This is why they are asking how you \"wish to proceed\". Courts grant and test your SOVEREIGNTY all the time. You simply have to listen to the words they are using. At this time you may respond, \"I wish to prove to some ass-wipe who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth, the things I know, so I wish to go to trial PRO SE. But I wouldn't recommend this...I would simply wish the case to be dismissed.\n\nIf they say anything else besides \"I agree, case dismissed\", you exercise your AUTHORITY by questioning. MASTERS QUESTION, SLAVES ANSWER. For instance if a \"justice\" said anything except \"I agree. Case dismissed,\" you question why they are even speaking. \"I'm sure you'll recall Mr. (insert justice's name here) that at the beginning of these proceedings I explicitly reserved all rights, including yours. Have I not made my wishes clear?\"\n\nAlways remember to respond in the form of a question. A question serves the dual-purpose of establishing your authority, and negating the possibility of UNDERSTANDING; because if you UNDERSTAND, you accept SURETY.\n\nAs stated before, the most powerful of these questions is, \"Who are you?\" UNDERSTANDING cannot be presumed until that question is answered.\n\nAbove all, questioning deflects SURETY.\n\nQuite possibly one of the most useful documents I have ever published is my NOTICE OF MISTAKE for Dean. This is a useful, powerful document that also instantly removes SURETY. I framed it in such a way that you can replace the name \"Dean Clifford\" with your name, and you can make a pad of these things. Have lots of copies to hand out to friends and opposing counsel. Hell the court clerk loves these things too...make sure the court clerk has one as well. Just make sure you UNDERSTAND what the document says. Read it carefully and understand what the words mean, because you will be challenged. And remember, the NOTICE by its very nature, presents several questions.\n\nDo not permit the proceedings to move forward without these questions being answered!\n\nBecause so many people ask for it, transcribed here is the copy of THE ROGUESUPPORT NOTICE OF MISTAKE.\n\n***Begin NOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nIn the matter of SURETY for the LEGAL NAME, I believe that there has been a\nMISTAKE as the SOLE BENEFICIARY has been INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED as the\naccused. If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR\nSUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led the COURT to believe\nby responding to “You” and or “DEAN CLIFFORD” and/or SUCH OTHER\nIDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am the PARTY\nWITH SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE and please forgive\nme.\n\nAs I have no knowledge of who “You” and or “DEAN CLIFFORD” and/or SUCH\nOTHER IDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, I RESPECTFULLY\nASK; by WHAT AUTHORITY is the COURT ADDRESSING me as such?\nAs the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT,\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I, as the SOLE BENEFICIARY of the\nTRUST have any SURETY in this matter?\n\nAs the GOVERNMENT is the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY on the SURETY BOND\n(BIRTH CERTIFICATE), with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL\nNAME, WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE for the\nLEGAL NAME. WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE and\nhave ANY SURETY with respect to the LEGAL NAME?\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a\nTRUSTEE or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN?\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the\nprincipal?\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that there has been any meeting of the\nminds, any PROPER NOTICE given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or\nthat I have ANY INTENT to CONTRACT in this matter?\n\nAs such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and\nCLOSURE.\nAUTHORISED BY:\n\n***End NOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nIf you truly UNDERSTAND what this document says and/or does, this is one of the most powerful documents you can wield in court. If you have the Dunning–Kruger effect you will likely go to jail. Used properly the NOTICE OF MISTAKE will ALWAYS remove any real or implied SURETY the court believes you may have.\n\nYou will notice the court always refers to \"belief\". When I say belief is evil, it is not just a disparaging remark against adults with \"imaginary friends\" (which they totally deserve), it is yet another example of why this statement is profoundly true. All belief is evil.\n\nYou are taught from childhood to \"respect belief\", and are constantly reinforced with the really dumb freedom that it is your \"right to believe what you want\". If I had the authority and/or power to remove just one right from humanity, and no more, the right to \"believe\" would be the one that I would eradicate. In all my years of studying, and being part of the Nobility, the curtailing of this one \"RIGHT\" would exponentially increase quality of life for all humanity. I calculate it would take two generations for it to \"stick\".\n\nBelief is the end of questioning. Belief is intellectual bankruptcy, and is the exact opposite of knowledge. You will never question if you \"believe\".\n\nLet's leap back to the 1500's to Shakespeare. This is where the concept of addressing somebody as \"YOU\" indicated the assignment of SURETY. No writings before this contained any such logistic mechanisms. Don't \"believe me\"...go look for yourself. Go look at the MAGNA CARTA yourself; and ask yourself why there's no \"YOU\" before Shakespeare. And ask yourself why the MAGNA CARTA, in all its current published forms, no longer has, \"To do right by Alexander\".\n\nThere may be three readers amongst you who understand what I just said there, and all of them are Scottish I guarantee you.\n\nIn any courtroom proceeding in the western world, SURETY IS PRESUMED, and it must be deflected from you. As a \"justice\" is not a PERSON under the law, the only PARTY that can ACCEPT SURETY is the PARTY making the CLAIM.\n\nThere may be certain readers who talk like they have a dick stuck in their mouth, who will demand proof of this...and so I direct you to the Rules of Civil Procedure (wherever you are) to look up SECURITY FOR COSTS.\n\nLet's zoom back to the present (so we can get as far away from belief as possible) where the word \"YOU\" is part of the English language, as are the titles, \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", and \"Mrs.\". All of these titles and means of addressing you, are in fact, assigning and/or presuming SURETY...yes, on YOU. The easiest mnemonic exercise you can do to make deflecting these titles second nature is to replace the titles \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", or \"Mrs.\" with the word, \"bitch\", in your head; and to respond as if they had addressed you as \"bitch\", because being addressed as \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", or \"Mrs.\" is doing exactly that.\n\nAs for the word \"YOU\", think of that as a tennis ball which must be served back. Assert your AUTHORITY by questioning whenever they address you as \"YOU\"; \"Are YOU addressing ME?\" If they're stupid enough to say yes, or even to imply the affirmative, be like that guy who talks like he has a dick in his mouth and demand proof; \"By what authority do YOU address me as a PARTY OF SURETY?\"...or something along those lines. Your only objective is to serve the \"YOU\" back to them.\n\nSo that's today's word, \"SURETY\". It's something you don't want, and I've just shown you how to give it back. I'd like to thank my involuntary guests, Dean Clifford, and the guy that talks like he's got a dick in his mouth. Since I was so liberal with their identities, I certainly have no problem putting in a free plug for a \"pretend radio\" show.\n\nSo here's a link to Dean Clifford talking about family court rules or something...hosted by a guy who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth. And before Pierre thinks I've \"soft-balled this one in there\" for him, I'm now going to presumptively say, \"Yes Pierre, I'm pretty sure it's Dean's dick he's sucking\".

Immediately after the death of my mother, my money crazed EVIL step-brother and step-sister (who hated my son and I because they knew that my son and I were in my \"Dad's\" LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT and were situated to get an equal share of my his Estate) sequestered my father from us by keeping him in their home without allowing my son and I access. Anyways, not a week later I get a call from my \"dad\" and with the prompting voices of the evil children in the background, my \"dad\" asks me for the car back, and, with much stress in his voice he informs me that he has changed his mind, and, has now decided he doesn't want to gift me the car. He now wants it back. Pissed, and realizing what was going on (he's a self professed victim of elder abuse at their hands) I reminded him that he has already gifted the car to me. After more prompting by the evil kids in the background, he tells me meekly that if I don't deliver the car by 8pm he would call the police. Fast forward to today...I have the car and \"can't\" get it registered in \"my\" NAME because: a) Service Ontario requires that my declaration that the car was gifted be verified by my step-father attendance wherein he must SWEAR or AFFIRM that he gifted the car in the presence of a Notary. The only other option provided by SERVICE ONTARIO is that I COMMIT FRAUD and claim I purchased the car, inform them of the amount I paid, and pay tax on that amount (this would obviously potentially cause injury to my \"dad\", as I'm sure that the CRA would be expecting him to declare the extra income on his tax return).  So, I am driving a car that is mine, which I cannot register unless I commit fraud. The tags on the plates have expired which I can't renew. Even though I have paid for insurance in \"my\" NAME, it is my understanding that the insurance provided is invalid because it must be in the name of the registered owner (they claim otherwise - the do highlight the fact that any potential claims that would normally be paid out to me would be paid out to my \"dad\"). The point of the story is: due to my unwillingness to commit FRAUD, I inadvertently find myself following in the tracks of Dean Clifford.

I was under the false impression(my fault) that by VOIDing the contract was doable because your name was on the docket. You control the name, use the name to contract with fictions. The name is your middleman sort of speak.\n\nBut never forget, the name is NOT YOURS!!!This is created and owned by the government of whoever created your birth certificate. In my case, it was quebec.\n\nNow, the government gave you that name to USE IT. You can contract with it, use it to receive benefits, use it for other commercial purposes.\n\nBut just because you use it, does NOT MEAN you are liable for it, so long as you don't accept it.\n\nThe whole point about the Notice of Mistake is to REBUT SURETY and ask questions they CANNOT ANSWER. \"They\" as in anyone interested in your case, which is the JUSTICE/CROWN.\n\nRemember the most important rule, they CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT SURETY. Surety is a guarantee that an account will be paid, you know the original charging instrument you get pinned against you? Yea, that. That is what they expect you to pay.\n\nSee the CROWN creates a charge, which is a liability, and the CROWN ASSUMES that you will act as SURETY. So over the course of a NORMAL PRECEDURE, you act as surety, so one way or the other, you will be getting damaged. But if you take the Notice of Mistake route, you can save yourself the trouble and make sure its dealt with immediately rather then taking the chance.\n\nNow getting back to VOIDing things. The way i look at it is VOIDing orders ensures that you no longer consent. What gives you the power to do these is look at the parties involved.\n\nIE. Restraining Order - Only 1 name is on there so 1 party. You. VOID it, who is to say you cant?\nInterim Order - 2 names. Having 2 names is irrelevant, still VOID it. \n\nImportant fact you must view is WHAT ARE ORDERS.\n\nIn one of my topics i talk about valuable securities and sureties being the same thing. When your name appears on ANY ORDER, you are a SURETY to it. Meaning they EXPECT YOU to PERFORM the OBLIGATIONS. That is what generates revenue. My security article talks about security and surety being one in the same UNLESS EXPRESSED OTHERWISE.\n\nThis is why the Notice of Mistake is powerful. Because it fulfilled the requirement to rebut security and/or surety.\n\nSo what happens when you rebut SURETY. It goes back to the sole signatory on the founding document. The birth certificate. The sole signatory is for my case \"Le Directeur d'etat civil\". That office is SURETY for my name. That office is responsible to pay accounts.\n\nAll public servants are from the GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENT is NOT A TRUST, but a collective of PERSONS CHARGED WITH TRUST DUTIES. This is called a TRUSTEE. A TRUSTEE is CHARGED with DUTIES to maintain and care for the ESTATE which is the TRUST. This includes acting as SURETY in ALL MATTERS brought against the ESTATE/TRUST/NAME. That is why the Notice of Mistake rebuts that and asks that very questions:\n======================================================\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE for the LEGAL NAME.\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE and have ANY SURETY with respect to the LEGAL NAME?\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a TRUSTEE or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN?\n======================================================\nIf the COURT/CROWN cannot provide evidence to all of the questions(lets face it probably wont happen), they it is impossible and might i say illegal for you to ACT as SURETY, as that would be IMPERSONATING a PUBLIC OFFICIAL.\n\nA beneficiary is an individual who received benefits and/or other incentives of a TRUST, but has none of the liabilities. You are the BENEFICIARY. THEY as in the COURT/CROWN are the TRUSTEES.\n\nNow that you know you cannot be trustee/surety, can they really proceed against you and/or hold you liable?\n\nThe answer is NO!\n\nRemember, your documentation is only as strong as you are. You are threatening their revenue, they WILL TRY and they WILL TEST YOU to see what you got what it takes.\n\nThe question is. Are you ready to cast away your fear spending a few nights in jail, or will you live in your comfort and continue to be controlled?\n\nThe choice ultimately is yours. It always has been.\n\nI would like to close this topic by one of my favorite quotes of all time.\n\n\"Peace.\n\nIt does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work.\n\nIt means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart.\"\n\n-Unknown "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_542494322453171","body":"Thoughts?

See \"Title 27 C.F.R. 72.11.\" All \"crimes are commercial\" and as such a violation of \"statute.\" If you trace that word back to its origins you will find that it is a \"statutory\" or \"performance bond,\" a \"bid bond.\" A \"bid bond\" which becomes a \"lien;\" or \"debt obligation:\" which is a \"commercial asset traded on the stock exchange.\" That is where the bit about contract law comes into play. Because all \"crimes are commercial,\" it is thru a trick of law called \"admiralty\" that they convict YOU, a \"living man\" for a crime owed a \"statutory obligation\" or \"bid bond;\" a \"lien.\" That means it is all a voluntary system.\n\nThe \"legal name,\" in all capital letters, is commercial property of the federal government. It conveys a loss of \"God given\" or \"unalienable\" rights under this law structure; based on Roman Civil Law. That is why that name is \"berthed\" into commerce upon \"delivery\" of the child from the \"mother's berth canal/womb\" or \"waterway.\" And the mother is given a \"certificate\" in exchange for the true \"title\" to her baby. She is given a BIRTH CERTIFICATE see BERTH, which is like a \"Bill of Laden.\" The \"Dockter\" \"berthed\" commercial property and in exchange all the mother gets is a \"certificate of title.\" While the true or alloidial title is retained by the State via one of the many \"blind adhesions\" in the Birth Certificate contract. The world has come under a dark cloud and that cloud is \"international maritime law\" or \"admiralty\" upon which all \"citizens\" of the Earth are subject(s). \"Resident/citizens\" are \"14th amendment\" creations \"of and by the federal government.\" The \"14th amendment\" was the first time the word \"person\" was ever mentioned in any law of this land. And that is because a \"person\" is not a \"people.\" A \"citizen\" is not a \"Citizen.\" A \"person\" is \"a creation for and by the United States and one who shall immediately fall under its jurisdiction.\" See the book Black's Law 4th ed. or earlier for help defining the word \"person.\"\n\nFurthermore if you read the postal reorganization act of 1970, you will see that the use of \"zip codes\" places you within a \"federal district, territory or possession.\" If you have ever read the constitution for the United states of America 1787/1789. You would know the original constitutional federal government only has jurisdiction \"within the ten square miles known as Washington D.C., and all other \"federal\" territories and possessions.\" To put all that together for you: Residents of the United States, which is \"a corporation;\" see 28 U.S.C. 3002(15)A, are employees of the federal government. Whom have signed blind adhesion contracts in \"admiralty\" that conspire collectively to turn \"people\" into \"persons\" and to deprive them of all constitutional due process and rights. Making them completely a statutory \"person,\" endowed with nothing other than what the creator/father-god/government wants for its \"children.\" Don't be misled, all \"residents\" are \"children\" of the federal government; commercial property given a bond number in commerce, traded on international markets. That number on the back of your S.S. card (should be in red or blue) is a \"cusip.\" Know what that is? By signing these contracts you place yourself into the \"commercial and territorial waters\" of the \"State of California,\" for instance; which is a \"commercial and territorial possession\" of the \"District of Colombia.\" The \"State of California\" belongs to the Federal government. And all of its \"residents/citizens\" are \"chattel property\" of the \"State.\" We are and have been under a state of Martial Law since Abraham Lincoln declared it so in 1863. See \"the enrollment Act of 1863.\" The whole Nation has been turned into one giant corporation, see the \"District of Colombia Organic Act of 1870,\" floating in \"international waters.\" Whereby all of its \"citizens\" are its \"commercial property\" and can be taken in as \"surety\" every time they \"offend\" \"code or statute\" and have a \"lien\" placed on their physical body. Though that \"lien\" can be discharged just \"for entertainment purposes only.\" See GSA form OF-90 and 91.\n\nThe purpose for the document was to establish with the powers that be that we \"inhabit\" the \"physical place/ space/ time\" known as the \"California Republic\" or \"California\" state. Not in a state, but \"on the land.\" Not in a \"state of confusion,\" not in the \"commercial and territorial waters of D.C.\" \"Located on the physical land mass, not in a state or territorial possession of the federal government.\" \"I am not on the citizen(s)ship.\" I am \"One of the People,\" which incidentally makes me a state's Citizen under the de jure \"common law.\" A man endowed with \"unalienable\" rights not \"inalienable\" privileges. \"I am a state's Citizen from the Common Law Republic of Georgia state,\" an independent and Sovereign territory and possession of \"We the People.\" One of the Several states which first attempted to form that \"most perfect Union.\" A \"Citizen of the federal Republican Union between the Several states,\" and \"One from the Several state's United.\" See the \"Postal Authorization Act of 1792,\" for help in understanding all the subtle use of language and its true meaning. Because we are and always have been a Constitutional Republic under all mighty God whereby all the \"people\" of this land are \"endowed with unalienable rights that neither man nor institutions of government can abrogate.\" \"A state's Citizen; One of the People from the Several states mentioned in the Constitution for the United states, 1787/1789..\" \n\nWith \"persons\" like yourself trying to teach people falsely, this once great \"Republic\" has become nothing more than a \"democratic oligarchy\" ruled by fat cats and despots. Anyone out there tired of getting stepped on. Educate yourself as to the nature of this beast. Because it is all simply \"commercial maritime law\" under \"admiralty\" which turns \"people\" into \"persons.\" See \"Title 8 Section 7 U.S.C.:\" all \"citizens are vessels, and as such commercial maritime property.\" To get back to what I was saying. I am a \"Citizen\" and a \"National.\" Of the \"Nation\" known as \"America.\" Not of the corporate \"United States.\" Notice the difference between \"Citizen/National\" and \"Resident/citizen.\" A \"National is not a citizen.\" A \"National\" is One of the \"People.\" A \"citizen\" is a \"person created by and for the Federal government.\" Which is now a corrupt \"de facto\" bent on world domination. \n\nThe reason for putting it into the journal; it is the local paper of record. We put our affidavits into the \"commercial arena\" via the \"local paper of record.\" We then wait 30 days and it becomes a matter of \"public record,\" a matter of \"public law\" or \"statute.\" One final thought, I know that \"U.C.C. 1-308\" does not provide for remedy other than to let the other party know that you are signing \"in propria persona.\" \"With a full retention of all your constitutional rights still intact.\" Don't you see that every contract we sign with the federal government is unconstitutional.. Because they use those contracts to take away your rights from God and give you only \"civil rights\" or \"privileges\" granted from the government. So as the \"living man:\" as \"a living soul,\" not as the \"strawman\" or \"stramineus homo.\" And that is what \"U.C.C. 1-308\" is truly for; \"signing contracts and retaining all unalienable rights and liberties while doing so.\" You are confusing \"remedies,\" the \"remedy\" you are looking for is found under \"U.C.C. 2-209.\" Which states in brief that \"a party subject to a contract has ten days to \"rescind\" that offer.\" As well, if you are still with me, see \"California Civil Code 1689(B)1;\" which states in brief that when \"an offer is forced ''under-duress,'' ''coercion,'' 'threat of loss to real time property,'' ''threat of enslavement,'' or ''mistaken identity'' etc., that offer can be \"rescinded\" unilaterally for all time.\" Returning all parties to the \"status quo ante.\" \n\nFinally because \"all crimes are commercial\" anything you put into the \"commercial arena\" can be turned into a \"crime; or offense of code, a debt obligation owed.\" It is always best to \"reserve your rights\" when making \"deposits\" into \"commerce.\" ... All rights reserved. Without Prejudice. \"U.C.C. 1-308.\" "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_541192572583346","body":"So....I scanned the whole page today looking for gold nuggets.

Helps when you light a fat one right at the police head quarters.\n\nSo blah blah got charged was thrown in the slammer for a night. Morning comes and I file the notice with me(cops were kind enough to retain my effects and allow me to file it in the record).\n\nGot thrown in before a JUSTICE.\n\nFirst thing i said before prosecutor tried to say anything was \"I reserve all rights presented, does anyone object?\"\n\nJUSTICE and prosecutor didn't deny. Said stupid shit like \"whatever rights those are\".\n\nMe \"fantastic, let the record show that no objection were made\".\n\n\"Did the prosecutor get my notice of mistake?\"\n\nProsecutor \"Yes, but I do not understand your language or intention\"\n\nMe \"Good. Have you answered the questioned I posed in that to in order for me to UNDERSTAND the NATURE of the PROCEEDINGS\".\n\nProsecutor \"Your honor, i request a short recess to review the documents that Mr DEREK HILL has served unto us\"\n\nJUSTICE \"Granted, how long do you need\"\n\nProsecutor \"I believe 1 hour should be sufficient\"\n\nShit gets adjourned.\n\nI get back in there. I restate all rights reserved.\n\nProsecutor \"I have been given time to review the notice of mistake that was submitted by Mr. DEREK HILL, and it is the position of the crown to reprimand him for the time being as .....(i didn't pay attention to it was distracted by the officer right beside me making threatening movements).\"\n\nWhen my attention restored back to the matter...\"I'm sorry but your officer is making threatening gestures,.I REQUIRE the crown to repeat that.\".\n\nprosecutor begins to repeat it.\n\nMe \"Point of order, there is questions before the court, this must be addressed. I MUST have these questions answered before I can understand the nature of the proceedings, does questioning not negate understanding?\"\n\nJUSTICE \"He has a point, crown what will you do?\"\n\nProsecutor \"At this time I do not have sufficient evidence to be able to answer those questions.\"\n\nJUSTICE \"Well since the crown is unable to answer the questions you posed, what would you like to do?\"\n\nMe \"Get the fuck out of here.\"\n\nJUSTICE \"Release him immediately. I am staying these proceedings for the time being.\"\n\nI was released and simply walked out.\n\nA week later i got a call from the crown attorney office(how they got my number i dont know). They wanted to let me know that the crown is withdrawing ALL charges(was 16 counts of possession)\n\nThis was my first time doing it with my new understanding from Notice of Mistake.\n\nI requested a transcript for the hearing, They said that they do not have the records. I didn't bother pursuing it. I knew I got them nervous.\n\nNow for the next few times, all of it was very similar to the above. Had to face the same prosecutor several times. Clearly this guy wanted my ass. Every time I stood by it. Every time I filed my notice of mistake.\n\nIF anyone is wondering, to file your notice you must have made a simple affidavit, attach the notice as exhibit \"A\" in your affidavit just put in \"See attached exhibit \"A\"\". Serve it on the crown, get it notarized and commissioned. I was \n\nin jail so everything got done quick. You can make your own if you choose. Substance over form.\n\nLast time was for the restraining order contempt. This was about a month ago. Cops were called was arrested blah blah. Was thrown in the slammer for 2 days. Finally went into the court. JUSTICE Nolan(total bitch 100%) was presiding.\n\nMe \"I reserve all ---\".\n\nJUSTICE \"Shut up I don't want to hear it\".\n\nMe \"How bout you suck dick? I still reserve all rights is there any objections?\"\n\nNo objections.\n\nMe \"Let the record show that no objections were made and all rights has been reserved.\"\n\nProsecutor \"This matter has been brought to my attention this morning. The individual before the court claims that he is not Mr. DEREK HILL\"\n\nMe \"Objection, have you answered my questions. If so, i do not see any response or any response made or any similar instruments.\"\n\nProsecutor \"Your honor, i do not understand what the accused is trying to say, I ask that ---\"\n\nMe \"Objection, by what authority does the crown have to address me as the ACCUSED?\"\n\nProsecutor \"Your honor, clearly the accused ---\"\n\nMe \"Objection, by what authority does the crown have to address me as the ACCUSED?\"\n\nJUSTICE \"Look, listen I am trying to get this done so we can release you.\"\n\nMe \"Objection AND Point of Order, questions are before the court. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS\".\n\nJUSTICE \"Shut up or I will hold you in contempt\"\n\nMe \"IF its civil, where is the breach? If its criminal who is complaining?\"\n\nJUSTICE \"I am adjourning this matter to give you some time to think about what you are saying\".\n\nOf course, I go back at the end of the day last case to be heard.\n\nMe \"I reserve all rights, is there any objections?\"\n\nNo objections. JUSTICE has a different tone.\n\nProsecutor \"It is the position of the crown and for the best interest of the public and JUSTICE that the charges be stayed for the time being\"\n\nJUSTICE \"Do I understand you correct that the crown wishes to stay the proceedings?\"\n\nProsecutor \"Yes, your honor.\"\n\nJUSTICE was clearly gritting her teeth at what was going on.\n\nJUSTICE \"Granted. Officer release him and give his belongings.\"\n\nI was released. It was the same prosecutor who was trying to nail me several times. HE was not HAPPY not one bit. He was clearly red and squishing his lips.\n\nThere was a reporter, asked to interview me, I said no.\n\nSO now that you got a gist of it, i will explain it the best i can.\n\nJUSTICE and crown prosecutor is from the same club house. If you look up JUSTICE at dunn and brad company listing, you will see JUSTICE is operating as OF ONTARIO, PROVINCE. Its omitted now but you used to be able to see it.\n\nAll officers carries out the bidding of the company. The BC is owned by the province, that is what the crown is after. The thing is, they try to ding you as surety. By you failing to rebut any names they use such as ACCUSED, that means you accept SURETY. That is what compels you to perform. Remember something very important. Contract = Law. You are not surety. The signature on that BC is the surety. let them deal with it. The province holds the legal title for the name also, so therefor again they are liable not you. You also cannot forget that they did not inform you of what you were doing.\n\nAnother thing i would like to add. MISTAKE. MISTAKE is very powerful in itself. The reason is that if you read into the Rules of Civil Procedure Ontario Annual Practice, they MUST accept your mistake and correct it/adjust it from the beginning. Note the adjust. It's just accounting. The JUSTICE and the Crown have a vested interest to prosecute you. They make money by prosecuting you. They both work at the same company.\n\nYou do not understand the company rules, therefor you best not take part in it. Like Scott Duncan said, you are not in the club.\n\nThe dialog is from my memory. I retained the majority of the meaning on how it went. And yes, all those cases seems to...vanish from record....convenient.

I answer he has a warrant/reciept for me. I asked if he had a signed complaint by an injured party. He says No and asks that i come with him. I was so stupid i did. At the jail i reserved all rights they were angry with confusion. Bond out. Court date. I arrived, my turn. I had the NOTICE OF MISTAKE with me. Along with a bunch of freedumbbb documents i didn't know what they meant, I was desperate so I said fuck it. The judge asks me to say my NAME but i didn't I spoke of SURETY for a minute or so and let myself be interrupted. I interrupt back. I asked the Judge who the injured party was she says the the PROSECUTOR was REPRESENTING a state corp.  called family human services or something. I asked for dismissal for LACK of signed complaint. She got angry. Then i pointed out that the PROSECUTOR the judge and the injured party all represented the STATE and that it was an obvious CONFLICT OF INTEREST. She got even more angry. She threatened me with jail bla bla bla. At one point i had to make a decision NOTICE OF MISTAKE or freeeduumbbb document that called them traitors and oath violaters and a bunch of dumb shit. So not knowing what to do I pulled out the NOTICE because it seemed alot safer, and said \" uh I NEED to give this to YOU.\" She ACCEPTED the NOTICE and started reading. She made it probably to the question section before she realized what she was actually reading. As soon as she did REAL-IZE what i gave her she literally threw it at the clerk spouting off about not knowing what a NOTICE OF MISTAKE is.. The CLERK filed it. The judges demeanor changed and she dismissed for LACK OF PROPER NOTICE. Because at some point i yelled i had not been NOTICED of any CHARGES. She made a point to say \" The only reason I'm dismissing this is for lack of proper notice\" but i knew she was full of stain shit! :-) My point is i actually gave the judge NOTICE. I don't advise it and certified mail is probably better but she READ it. She couldn't say she had not READ IT or ACT like she hadn't because it was handed to her with me there. She couldn't ACT like she didn't understand my questions because the NOTICE states the FACTS in the beginning. BAM!!!! \nDISCLOSURE: This is not legal advise. I dont advocate going to court.

In any event settlement is achieved. \n\n Markings on a note stating 'This note is legal tender for a specific type of debt' may be deemed to be conclusive evidence of the note being legal tender for that specific type of debt. It does not however generate the status. It merely confirms it.\n\n For a note to be deemed conclusively as not being legal tender, it must be marked as such.\n\n Notes not marked as legal tender, may still in fact be legal tender, if they fulfil the function of payment, and refusal of them extinguishes the debt. If the note in question is a method of payment which is statutorily acknowledged, then they are arguably legal tender, even though not marked. It is the function not the label which defines what is or is not legal tender. Counterfeit money is marked as legal tender, though it certainly is not. The label follows the function. \n\n This Note is legal tender for all debts public and private.\n\n There is nothing to suggest that all notes which are legal tender must be suitable for debts both public and private. There is nothing which suggest that something which is legal tender for a public debt must also be legal tender for a private one, or vice versa. There is nothing to suggest that a specific specie of money marked thusly is the only form of legal tender. \n\n It is entirely possible that there are other forms of payment, which though not marked as such are legal tender, but only for specific types of debts.

Stocks, bonds, notes, convertible debentures, warrants, or other documents that represent a share in a company or a debt owed by a company or government entity. Evidences of obligations to pay money or of rights to participate in earnings and distribution of corporate assets. Instruments giving to their legal holders rights to money or other property; they are therefore instruments which have intrinsic value and are recognized and used as such in the regular channels of commerce.... You have a person & according to the definition of securities, I'm willing to suggest that the birth certificate may fall into the category of, 'or other document that represent a share in a company or a debt owed by a company or government entity' and as we are the 'legal holder' of this document, then the right to life, liberty and... 'security of the person' may just mean that you have the right to collect on that trust/account But, again, as the grantor/beneficiary of that trust account, I'm guessing we need to instruct the trustees & not ask them...there's a certain amount of speculation here (what Scott Duncan would probably call talking out of my ass )\n\nScott Duncan: BIRTH CERTIFICATE = BILL OF LADING\n\nGlad I could help\n\nPete Daoust: Bill of Lading legal definition: A document signed by a carrier (a transporter of goods) or the carrier's representative and issued to a consignor (the shipper of goods) that evidences the receipt of goods for shipment to a specified designation and person.\n\nScott Duncan: Parents were the GRANTOR (one of the parties that created the bill of lading).\n\nListen up and pay attention.\n\nYOU ARE THE CARRIER!\n\nA Truck ACTING AS CARRIER is NOT \"120,000 RonCo Turnip Twaddlers\"!\n\nIT IS, IN FACT, A CARRIER THAT HAS \"120,000 RonCo Turnip Twaddlers\"!\n\nIt's delivering it to YOU (The Beneficiary). It just hasn't arrived yet.\n\nYou don't know that YOU own the CARGO. If you OWN the cargo you are transporting you are no longer in commerce. You are transporting PROPERTY.\n\nDerek Moran: OWN the cargo = TRANSPORTING, TRANSPORTING = no longer in commerce. . . . .CARRIERing cargo = engaged in commerce\n\nScott Duncan: The NAME is the CARGO, and the BIRTH CERTIFICATE is the BILL OF LADING. It's valueless on it's own. Hence the term \"Sold a bill of goods\".\n\nPete Daoust: Two basic types of bills of lading. A straight bill of lading is one in which the goods are consigned to a designated party. An order bill is one in which the goods are consigned to the order of a named party. This distinction is important in determining whether a bill of lading is negotiable (capable of transferring title to the goods covered under it by its delivery or endorsement). If its terms provide that the freight is to be delivered to the bearer (or possessor) of the bill, to the order of a named party, or, as recognized in overseas trade, to a named person or assigns, a bill, as a document of title, is negotiable. In contrast, a straight bill is not negotiable.\n\nPete Daoust: a straight bill is not negotiable\n\nStuart Stone: Ok, got it so far (I think)...so when you lien the name, are you doing it because you haven't been paid for transport/carriage of the goods?\n\nScott Duncan: You are letting the world know that the cargo is in fact YOURS. Nobody has the right to presume your cargo is for commerce now.\n\nScott Duncan: That is ALL a Lien is.\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: is this what I should be looking at? (Scott clicked Like on this)\nhttp://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/P07.pdf\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: A maritime lien is a lien on a vessel, given to secure the claim of a creditor who provided maritime services to the vessel or who suffered an injury from the vessel's use. Maritime liens are sometimes referred to as tacit hypothecation. Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions.\n\nThe maritime lien has been described as \"one of the most striking peculiarities of Admiralty law\".[14] A maritime lien constitutes a security interest upon ships of a nature otherwise unknown to the common law or equity. It arises purely by operation of law and exists as a claim upon the property concerned, both secret and invisible, often given priority by statute over other forms of registered security interest.[15] Although characteristics vary under the laws of different countries, it can be described as:\n\na privileged claim, upon maritime property, for service to it or damage done by it,\naccruing from the moment that the claim attaches, travelling with the property unconditionally, enforced by an action in rem.[14]\n\nDerek Moran: An action IN REM, versus, an action IN PERSONAM..... interesting stuff (Scott clicked Like on this)\n\n*UPDATE STARTS HERE*\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: I have a question.

You still get Nazis, so there's that.\n\nJust because they don't feel like following the rules, doesn't mean we have to be “scumbags” like them. I listened to all the audio recordings that Dean Kory made of his hearings (time I'll never get back, so you fucking owe me, dude!), and I feel it's important for me to correct a few key points here.\n\nI know all of you get your information from multiple sources, ranging from the Grand-Poobah of the Free-Dumb Movement, Robert Menard, to Dean Clifford, to Winston Strout; and maybe it's just self-aggrandizement, but I like to think I'm the only source that tells you the truth instead of just orbiting it. As with many things in life there's “more than one way to skin a cat”. However, one of the worst things you can do is “mix methods”.\n\nDean Clifford and I are at exact opposite ends of the scale. Dean's name is Trust property, thus giving the man that you know as Dean Clifford a great number of options the rest of you don't have. He doesn't use the Trust like a bank machine, he doesn't abuse any of the authority that any Trust title gives him, and he has the personal knowledge that he's not on his own if he has to “get the fuck out of Dodge”. That's where the consensus ends amoung us.\n\nDean's teachings on Trust Law are accurate, concise and accessible. For some reason it's worth it for him to give everything he teaches those qualities.\n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI'm not a super-genius, and I don't possess any mental powers that you don't. Any discussion and/or engagement with me starts off with the reality that you ALL THINK WRONG, and YOU ALL VALUE THE WRONG THINGS! This does not serve you when you are up against reality.\n\nThe sad part is that most of you are too old to change; and as I've demonstrated here in this little forum, none of you can tell the difference between what's true and what feels good. I know what you're experiencing. Whether from Dean, or from myself, the time always comes when you read something that one of us writes and you KNOW that it is true; but you take no further time to understand what is being told to you.\n\nFortunately Dean Kory has provided us a working/living example of what happens when all of the above factors are in play.\n\nThe first obvious mistake that Dean Kory is making is that he is combining what Dean Clifford teaches with what I teach. For the purposes of this article I'm going to dumb the two positions down so you can make the comparison.\n\nDean Clifford is all about being left alone, and when he's not left alone, he is about calling “them” to account.\n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI am descended from the very people that put all of this in place. Entire stereotypes about Scottish people exist to misdirect. Most will tell you that Scotsmen are “cheap”, when in reality we are conservative about when we engage in commerce. You have but to look at England's and Scotland's history to see why this is true.\n\nThe very name of this group, THE TENDER FOR LAW, is all about that mysterious phrase, “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER”.\n\nI'll be the first to admit there are a great number of benefits to be enjoyed in commerce, when everybody plays by the rules. As I'm sure everyone is sadly aware of, by now; Nobody is playing by the rules anymore.\n\nTrying to “fix the system”, or call them to account in their own system, is simply “appealing to your rapist”. It baffles me that anyone would think this is sound thinking.\n\n...I digress.\n\nAs I'm in a unique position to “follow the money”, I can determine who needs to pay the price for the royal screw-over we've been given. As I type this, a team of system's engineers (and trained monkeys) are preparing for you, the reader, a step-by-step guide for cleaning out every financial institution that touches these shores. The only price that I ask for this knowledge is that you pass it on to others. Pay it forward...and get paid at the same time. Who else offers that shit?\n\nI am many things. I am prorogued Nobility. I am a published author. I am a composer. Above all...the thing that forms the core of who and what I am, is that I am a computer scientist. Those who have taken the time to actually listen to me, will recognize many “Scott-isms”; and the phrase “COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING” is repeated almost as often as my Number 1 “Scott-ism”, “THE MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG.” You ignore these two truths at your own peril.\n\n...and reality does not care what you “believe”.\n\nThis lengthy preamble is to drive the next point home.\n\nDO NOT TRY TO COMBINE DEAN'S METHODS WITH MINE.\n\nThere is no remedy in fraud. There simply isn't.\n\nIn many ways I long for the old days where those who breached the PUBLIC TRUST were hauled into the street and thrown into an angry mob. Authors have mistakenly used the term, “Hanging Judge” as a term for a judge imposing strict penalties; but if you look through actual history, and not the crap you were taught in the Public Fool System, “Hanging Judge” refers to a judge who has abused his power and has been hung for the abuse of that trust. He gives sentences he should be hung for; HANGING JUDGE. You never hear the phrase “hanging JUSTICE” This is odd, as there are so many of them. ...I know. Digressing. I get it.\n\nWe don't have Judges any more, in Canada. A judge traditionally was a trusted individual who could uphold the PUBLIC TRUST. “We the people” no longer get to decide who is worthy of that trust. People confuse the role of “judge” with the current role of “JUSTICE”. It is important to know the distinction.\n\nJUSTICE is actually a “doing-business-as” name for a Crown Corporation. It actually says, in the Dunn and Bradstreet listings “Government of Ontario Operating as JUSTICE”. It has been like that, IN VARIOUS FORMS, since 1982.\n.\n..I'm sorry you missed it.\n\nThat is what you're dealing with, and you have ONE unalienable RIGHT; THE RIGHT NOT TO CONTRACT.\n\nMy position is a lot closer to that held by Irene Gravenhorst, than it is to Dean Clifford's.\n\nSo, let's cover what Dean Kory is doing wrong!\n\nI notice a lot of “Clifford-isms” in what Dean Kory is clearly attempting to say; but all of Dean Clifford's methods depend on what I like to refer to as “Clubhouse Rules”, and every time you do this you're pretending to “be in the club”. The natural response to somebody doing this is very similar to the response to somebody saying they know more than I. In case you haven't noticed I smack them down in the most humiliatingly, and public way possible. “Their” reaction is going to be much the same...we're all human after all.\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE (like the cheese) stands alone.\n\nIt is the only issue you should be concerned about! NOTHING ELSE!\n\nSERIOUSLY! Accepting discussion about anything else, is a FUCKING NEGOTIATION. All of you are not seeing the forest through the trees. This is why I say Dean Clifford's position is flawed. He believes the tree can be pruned to look pretty again, when in reality it needs it's roots burned out, and it's limbs chopped up for one of Sir-Mica's gassifiers! The fucking tree is dead!\n\nUNDERSTAND?\n\nThe tree is dead!\n\nIt's filled with parasites and rot, and the parasites are trying to keep the illusion of a tree standing. For the past two years I have been feeding them the rope, at my own expense, and with violence inflicted upon me, so that any argument contrary to my position is immediately nullified. IT IS/WILL BE, CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE that you are NOT getting what you are entitled to, given the burden of surety you have carried!\n\nUnlike THE MAJORITY of your “sources of truth”:\n\nI'm not one of these people that wants to drive without a licence.\nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their mortgage.\nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their taxes.\nI DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE I FUCKING PROMISED TO!\nI am, however, someone that possesses knowledge and skills that the government finds/found essential to their expansion. In my youth I gave our erstwhile government a tool, which all of you pay the price for today; and I was rewarded handsomely. I patted myself on the back, and strutted around, knowing that I was smarter than everyone else, and never once paying attention to the harm I had caused.\n\nIn compliance with an oath I took a long time ago, I must atone for that; and that's the only reason you, the reader, even know that I exist.\n\nI need to remind you again, that the only reason I'm here, is that I promised to be.\n\nNone of you have value to me. You're not qualified to.\n\nI have a lot to teach you, and we are barely getting started; but I am not responsible for the shit that goes wrong when you try to take what I teach you (“REALITY”) and you try to jam it into your idiotic, unqualified, belief structure. As I write that sentence I wonder how many of you have actually pondered that other “Scott-ism” you frequently hear; “ALL BELIEF IS EVIL.” If you believe something, you will stop questioning it; you will stop investigating it, and you will never ponder if, and why, it's true.\n\nShould you believe something, that just happens to be true, you won't look any further – and that's a problem.\n\nSo I want everyone to keep the following in mind. All the sources you are investigating tell the truth about the law, but there are pitfalls!\n\nEverything Robert Menard says about the law is true. It's what he doesn't say that's the lie. If you want quick confirmation of this simply ask him what, “This note is legal tender” means. If he tells you the truth (he won't), ask him why he's constantly “begging” for that very same TENDER FOR LAW that contains the ACTS and STATUTES that he claims don't apply to him! THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER is a TENDER FOR LAW. If you BENEFIT, then you have OBLIGATION!\n\nEverything Dean Clifford says about the law is true, but how he chooses to apply it, is not; because there's still a lot of “belief” running around in his head. He still believes he can “beat them at their own game.” He will proudly point out their public and blatant violations... His evidence is irrefutable and conclusive. His rights are violated by those TRUSTEES of the PUBLIC, and then he tries to seek remedy from those same trustees! REALLY?\n\n...and then says the remedy, is to go to those very same people and “sue” them..in the very same courts that violated his rights. (What?) ...Oh that's right, those are DIFFERENT courts, with DIFFERENT\n“Doing business as” JUSTICES. (WHAT?) ...well, I'll just let you work out the flaw from there. If you can't, then you are too stupid to be reading this, and you should kill yourself.\n\nFeel free to try it this way. It's NOT “wrong”, but it ignores the fact that those who hold the PUBLIC TRUST, ARE wrong. Another “Scott-ism” is my position that NONE OF YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT FEELS GOOD! Following Dean Clifford's methods WILL drive this point home, so it's not a COMPLETE waste.\n\nWell then...back to Dean Kory.\n\nRumour has it, through the grape vine, that the erstwhile Mr. Kory has been and/or will be, a guest on Global C.R.A.P. Radio, hosted by the redoubtable Tony “guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth” Butros. This promises to be an exciting show, and I cannot wait to miss it. I eagerly anticipate the thrill of not consuming time I'll never get back.\n\nInstead I'll put something useful here – advice for your next court room appearance, Mr. Kory.\n\nWhen you're in the court room dealing with these babbling, sacks-of-shit, learn to use the breaks. Repeat after me, “I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS”. If they ignore your question, then your next response should be, “OBJECTION. If the court cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.” Keep repeating that, and repeating that, and repeating that...until they answer your fucking question.\n\nI listen to you in court, Dean Kory, and I picture a girl screaming rape while slipping the condom on the rapist. I notice the distinct lack of that phrase in ANY of your recordings, so repeat it in your head, “Objection. If you cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.”\n\nApply THE TENDER FOR LAW Rule to this. I choose my words very, very carefully, because I know what they mean. You, the reader, seem to believe there's a library in your ass, because that's demonstrably where you keep pulling your answer out of. If you see me using a phrase that should be used in court, the very first thing you should do is follow my rules. Look up every single word, even, no scratch that, ESPECIALLY, if you THINK you know what the word means. As the regular reader for THE TENDER FOR LAW will tell you, you most certainly don't.\n\nDean Kory reserves his rights, and then doesn't know what the fuck to do with them; but that's ok, because there are plenty of other people in the court room that know what to do with Dean Kory's rights.\n\nOne thing Dean Kory should learn is that he is most certainly not Dean Clifford. Make no mistake, it doesn't matter if I disagree with Dean Clifford's methods. The fact is, I understand them. What Dean Clifford is doing is beyond your current level of comprehension. He is not joking when he says that everything he says and does, is part of a larger plan. I disagree with Dean Clifford's position and methods, because he pays too high a price for the sake of worthless people; but he's doing it for all of you, and not just for himself. I will admit statistically, this does skew the numbers in his favour; because in the end, Dean Clifford is like you. You all think wrong, and value the wrong things.\n\nThe only difference between you and Dean Clifford is that some of the things he values ARE the right things.\n\nWe are all doing this for different reasons.\n\nRobert Menard will try to scam you out of every cent you have by telling you the truth...because he thinks you deserve it. You're the Mafia wife, the enabler, and he rationalizes that he's not taking anything of any value from you.\n\nDean Clifford sees that you're all asleep, and he values mankind as a whole; but like Mary Croft before him, he's beginning to realize that everyone prefers “lucid dreaming” to actually being awake. The time he takes pandering to that crowd robs him of time, and returns nothing.\n\nMy position is blatantly self-centered. I was born with a title I didn't choose. I was sold to the government, and warehoused for McMaster University because it turned out I was smarter than everybody...and apparently that's a crime. When I began to call all parties to account, they spared themselves by making certain promises and offering certain concessions and entitlements, which they no longer honour.\n\nMy aim is to misbehave.\n\nLike Robert Menard, I want you to suffer for your ignorance, especially if you've come to me before. I want to wield what I know against those who would dare seek to harm me and those that I care about; because all of you are walking a path now, and none of you realize it's a one-way trip. You all want your freedom, and my position is, “Be careful what you wish for.”\n\nAs you all think wrong, and value the wrong things, so it is unlikely you could possibly know what to do with freedom. If you find yourself making that one-way trip, through that hole in the fence, remember that on the other side, are people just like me.\n\nAll of you are welcomed to believe whatever makes you feel good. Martin Sutton's belief, for instance, makes him feel good, and he identifies it as the core of who he is; and all I can think is, “This is what happens when evil has consumed an extraordinary man.”\n\nALL belief is evil. Martin Sutton is incapable of evil, so the belief sits there like a parasite, taking this man's good qualities and giving them to “Jesus”.\n\nAt this point I can classify Martin Sutton as belief's “best-case-scenario”.\n\nBelief is taking not thinking and making a virtue out of it.\n\nAll of the people from whom you seek knowledge are extraordinary in their own way. However, reality doesn't care about these things.\n\nI certainly hope this effort gets Mr. Kory focused on what's important, but the reality is, all of this is a symptom of a much larger problem.\n\nWe're all running out of time. I don't know if anyone has noticed the professional name-callers have been labeling people who point out the truth as “conspiracy theorists”, while at the same time publishing the inane babbling of actual conspiracy theorists. This method is much like Americans putting people who hire hookers on sex-offender registries, thus removing any distinction between a guy who indulges in a rent-a-fuck-toy experience, and the Scarborough rapist. Because none of you understand the exponential function, you couldn't see the bell-curve of your rights being whittled away.\n\nBefore I end this article, let's take a little walk through Canadian legal history.\n\nAt this point in legal history, the Criminal Code pretends to be the Common Law remedy, bestowed to an administrative zone of a sole proprietor CORPORATION called Canada...but this wasn't always the case.\n\nI'm going to presume that you don't have knowledge of the Canadian Bill of Rights. I freely admit this is not a reasonable presumption as Dean Clifford never shuts up about it (I swear that guy jerks off reading it).\n\nOne of the most protected rights in that bill of rights was Freedom of Speech. Under the Bill of Rights “offences” like hate speech, blasphemous libel (yes, that's a criminal code offence – look it up), and “uttering a death threat”, would not be possible.\n\nThe UK Canada Act 1982, better known as “The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms”, includes a “notwithstanding” clause. This gives the elected representatives of an administrative zone's constituency the power and authority to say, “Fuck off, that's just stupid,” to any Federal Statute. The closest a province has ever come to using this was on the “gay marriage” issue. Everyone's entire government had just been privatized, and their biggest concern appeared to be whether two dudes can marry.\n\nI look at events like this and sometimes I can't help but think, “Maybe Menard's right. Maybe you do deserve it.”\n\nAnyway, while you were all in a tizzy about whether a dude can wear a wedding dress and be taken seriously, other more sinister machinations were afoot.\n\nHis name is Ernst Zündel of Regina v. Zündel fame, and his story went something like this:\n\nErnst Zündel is one of those ideological pustules on society that invariably erupt when free speech is so vigorously protected. I've read what Mr. Zündel has to say, and he cites reliable sources to support his position. This ignores the reality, and other evidence, that counters his position.\n\nWhat's more reasonable to accept?\n\nThat the holocaust didn't happen? Or that Roma (gypsies), the mentally ill, the handicapped, the Muslims, the Jews, the homosexuals, and the political dissidents, were all rounded up and exterminated; and the Jews just whined about it the most. People doing stupid things at “crime scenes” don't help, and support idiots like Mr. Zündel. With only a little, tiny bit of probing, you will discover this fun fact regarding the holocaust. Those smoke-stacks on Auschwitz were built in 1947 for “dramatic effect”; and when pressured on it, every holocaust memorial foundation grudgingly admits this is true.\n\nBut back to Mr. Zündel....\n\nErnst Zündel was doing the Streisand effect, before Barbara Streisand made it cool.\n\nAfter the constitution was ratified, parliament quickly set about whittling away your free speech rights, and Ernst Zündel happened to be in the right place at the right time. No one knew it then.\n\nNow Ernst Zündel is a hateful little man; and he wants the world to know it. So much so, he decided you could avail yourself of his opinion by calling up his “976 Hate Speech Hotline”...for the low, low charge of ten dollars appearing on your phone bill, you could injest all the hate-mongering that would fit on an answering machine tape (Yes, a fucking tape. That's how long ago this shit happened).\n\nPeople called up and he actually profited from being a hateful little man...and if the story ended there, you could reasonably think, “Fuck this is Canada. You can do anything”, and we'd all live happily ever after.\n\nAfter a couple of months of profiting from people with more money than brains, rumour of this great scam eventually fell on the ears of a Jew. See? Mel Gibson was right. Jews are always causing trouble. Well it came to pass, that this great scam did fall on the ear of a Jew, and attached to that ear of a Jew, was a Jew with a finger, which could dial a telephone; and for the bargain price of ten bucks...he could make history!\n\nI freely admit that I wouldn't pass that shit up, so there's no way a Jew's going to. Remember the stereotypes kids, and be advised that Jews come to Scottish people to learn humility.\n\nDo you guys see how many stereotypes I've managed to jam into here so far?\n\nAs the result of this hilarious chain of events, Mr. Zündel became the dubious winner of the “First Man to be Charged with Hate Speech” prize. Under this “code” Mr. Zündel's position was indefensible, but he had an “ace up his sleeve”. He had studied the constitution and believed he had the right to do what he did. His lawyer, probably another Jew, saw dollar signs rocketing all the way to the Supreme Court, so he grabbed onto the Law Society's tit and sucked as hard as he could. This case plodded through the courts relentlessly, and ended up at the Supreme Court where they freely admitted that all hate speech laws are, by their very nature, unconstitutional. However, Nazis are “bad” so they decided to remove that right and blatantly ignore anything the constitution has to say, with an addendum pointing out that each administrative zone (province) has the right to exercise that “notwithstanding” clause nobody's ever dared use.\n\nThey'll save it for something important...like dudes getting married to each other. I say dudes because I refuse to accept the proposition that hot girl-on-girl action is NOT a human right.\n\nThese events marked the beginning of the slippery slope of rights removal all of you are just discovering now. It has been happening for a very long time.\n\nMuch has happened since the Zündel case. The public is slowly spoon-fed ridiculous concepts. The United States slipped even faster using our “enlightened” hate-speech laws as an example. Now there is a perfectly “legal” “War on Terror”. Americans are so stupid that they don't even realise they're making war on something that's not even an noun. “War on Drugs” at least meets the “noun” criterion. If you had to defend the “War on Drugs”, it's only defense would be, “At least we're making war on a noun.”\n\nI'll let that sink in.\n\nHow many stupid “Patriotic Americans” don't realize there's a war on something that's not even a fucking noun. If I think you don't deserve to live for not realizing that, imagine how low you rank in the eyes of those who created this policy – all \"perfectly legal\".\n\nWe need a Monarch dictator for a generation, to bitch-slap you back to reality. For, one of the other things that I don't hide, is the fact that I, and other privateers, commissioned the AQUILAE TRUST with the primary mandate: To assist in the restoration of executive power of the Monarchy, under the terms of the AQUILAE COVENANT.\n\nThree generations ago, Princess Elizabeth called to the then recently-released slaves, to help her stop the Empire from being wiped-out by the Germans. And she is of German descent. That war left a legacy that is priceless. It formed the corner stone of civilization and brought us into a new Golden Age.\n\nThe laws of commerce work when everybody plays by the rules, and when everybody's rights are respected. For three decades I have screamed that this is not happening.\n\nSo I have set out to prove it to you. My goal is to show you all that there is no deception. They're just not playing by the rules any more. The people responsible for your chronic ignorance, jumped ship long ago. Now we're stuck with parrots and chimps, running a mighty, but decaying, infrastructure.\n\nJust remember this is on an exponential curve too.\n\nI am doing my utmost to construct a lifeboat, and to detach you from all this. What I am constructing (to paraphrase Q from Star Trek) has wonders to satiate all desires, both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.\n\nHere is my court room position in a nutshell.\n\nYou do not accept surety – EVER.\n\nStep 1: Reserve all rights. (get Derek Moran to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\n\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed. Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS. If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.\n\nAnything outside of this supports their position that you are “playing” their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules. The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.\n\nThink very carefully about this. If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\nand its rules, you might raise the obvious question, “Why do you get to move two pieces?” If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to “understand” that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game. You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert.\n\nNovice drivers and expert drivers all have to follow the same rules. You don't get to ignore rules because you suck at them. Just as my chess board is not a chess school, the court will not allow the presumption that you being a novice is a lawful excuse. The only method to extract yourself “with honour” is to accept responsibility for the mistake in presumption. They are presuming something wrong...and you are acknowledging it's your fault. The court must accept this MISTAKE, and your entreaty for forgiveness for the unintended debt created. The court MUST do this.\n\nYour name should never come into it. Your name is but a piece of evidence in a much larger presumption that the court has the right to attach a name derived from a public document, to a living man. This, of course, is untrue. The court knows it's not their right. That's why in the Mary Croft days, the quote “living man” argument worked. But these are trimming at the branches of the poisonous tree in an attempt to make it look pretty. The only solution is to target the root. The root is accounting and surety; there's no farther to dig down.\n\nYou have all heard the quote, “I am not a number. I am a free man.” This came from the profoundly subversive British television series, The Prisoner, which exposes the Noble Lie in the most blunt and obvious way possible, without using the actual words. If you take the time and watch this series, you can see very clearly, knowing what you know so far, exactly how everything is. The protagonist, played by Patrick McGoohan, who truly supports the concept that acting is an art form, is only ever identified as “Number 6”. The highest ranking officer in the prison is only “Number 2”, whose character keeps changing; none of them ever answering the constantly-posed question, “Who is 'Number ONE'?”\n\nAnd...because I fucking-love giving away the ending...\n\n“Number ONE” turns out to be a delusion of the protagonist's own making, whom others around him exploited; all to answer the question, “Why did you resign?” I want you to think about that as you go down this path.\n\nYou will be pursued by the people you once served, and you will be asked, “Why did you resign?” To answer is to become “salvage”. You never learned why “Number 6” “resigned”, because his position is what your position should be as regards government.\n\nNONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS!\n\nIf you want to be even more hostile reach for a “Scott-ism”, FOR WHATEVER REASON OFFENDS YOU THE MOST!\n\nSo there's your homework. Read this article over, and over, and over again. Just so there's no confusion, I am communicating on several levels here. Whoever is reading this, pay close attention to what I say.\n\nThat's it. Scroll to the top, and read again.

This is article number two in as many days!\n\nDerek Moran says that he finds it difficult to believe that I will be able to top the SURETY article...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.\n\nIt is almost midnight on Sunday, I'm on the bridge of the Tycho-Brahe, and as I look out onto the lake the water is like a sheet of glass...and it's not even frozen. How can I not produce a superior article tonight? So today, with all my \"God\" complex, \"arrogance\", and the knowledge that a host of \"pseudo radio\" is reading my superior work, and knowing that all he can do is tremble in impotent fury. Things are so good I can cover the bad aspects of law, namely its language.\n\nSome of you may have already started to figure this out, but every single word in a legal document is designed specifically for the purpose of trapping you. Even words like AND, OR, IS, MAY, SHOULD...all of these are traps! And law dictionaries use them perfectly. You may have noticed words like UNDERSTAND don't mean what you think they mean. This is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit in the legal world. What I am about to teach you here is the legalese equivalent of \"code breaking\".\n\nLet's jump back to the 1500's...\n\nThis is the time in our civilization that we often refer to as the Renaissance. The reason the Renaissance occurred is that whole shitloads of people were dying of various forms of plague, and rat-shit-covered scientists were baffled as to why this virulent disease was spreading everywhere.\n\nThe practical result of all this was that a whole shitload of people died, and the ones that made it, inherited all their possessions. Efforts to communicate more efficiently became a social priority, because there was lots to do to maintain all this new property, and not enough people to do it. For nearly 800 years \"God\" was everything, despite his demonstrable lack of assistance in this era. You see the age where \"God\" was everything was called the \"dark ages\". Every time I hear an adult with an \"imaginary friend\" talk about how \"ignorant and closed-minded\" I am, all I see is an individual that wishes to return to that horrible time.\n\nAs there were fewer people in the 1500's, and the Renaissance was just getting underway, inherited art was often used as currency. The next generation had a higher literacy rate than the previous, and so administrative rules were born. It doesn't take a \"Rocket Scientist\" to see how useful slipping Shakespeare in around the latter half of the 1500's would be to those few who don't actually do any work. The false profession of \"law\" was born.\n\nYou'll notice that nobody ever \"does\" law. They only \"practice\" it. They keep practising and practising, but they never quite get it right (that's what you get for not subscribing to the TENDER FOR LAW!).\n\nFrom the 1500's to the present, there has been an odd phenomenon regarding language. English is a Germanic language that merged with the language of the Angols (we will discuss the Angols and the Picts in another article). Germanic influence on the language of the Angols resulted in the English written in the MAGNA CARTA. But if you try to learn German today, you'll notice an interesting phenomenon. Though the words you use sound startlingly similar, and the really observant can actually pick out the words when German speak and get a general idea of what they're saying, even if they don't speak the language. Except further study shows that the Germans speak \"backwards\" grammatically. Jumping to the south-west, Spanish, a much simpler language, where every vowel is a syllable, and words say what they mean, but once again, \"grammatically backwards\". Head north-east in our mental European map...to France...well France is filled with French people so we needn't bother with them. Those French have a different word for everything, and their language is, you guessed it, \"grammatically backwards\".\n\nThose of you noticing the pattern here will not be using too much intellect when they start posing the question, \"Maybe we're the ones that are backwards\". And that is almost, but not quite true.\n\nLike a virus, legalese infected the English language. It's encouraged to this day to use legalese to appear \"smart\". This is done on purpose. It is an insidious piece of social engineering.\n\nThe want you to try to use these words without knowing what the little words mean.\n\nIT'S ALL ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS.\n\nWhen you read, you read from left to right on a page. The small words actually exclude part of the sentence. You will notice in my now famous, NOTICE OF MISTAKE, that I always use \"and/or\". I do this on purpose, because I like to keep my options open.\n\nMaxims of Law say it plainly. The inclusion of one thing excludes all others. The definition of a PERSON in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA is the most hysterical example of this. The definition of PERSON is hidden in the larger scope of \"every one\". The common law maxim, \"The INCLUSION of one is the exclusion of another\" means in the context of the CRIMINAL CODE INCLUDES \"Her Majesty\" AND an \"organization\". See for yourself:\n\n*** THE CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA***\n“every one”, “person” and “owner”\n\n« quiconque », « individu », « personne » et « propriétaire »\n\n“every one”, “person” and “owner”, and similar expressions, include Her Majesty and an organization;\n\n**********************************\n\nYou will find this by searching for R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 under the Interpretations Section.\n\nIn reality, what this says is that a \"PERSON\" is \"HER MAJESTY\". Unless you are \"HER MAJESTY\" people answering to these acts and statutes are simply \"performing these acts\" (remember Shakespeare) on \"HER MAJESTY's\" behalf, much like the GOVERNOR GENERAL PERFORMS royal duties on the Queen's behalf. This is why the GOVERNOR GENERAL is always a chosen CITIZEN, and not an elected official.\n\nThe GOVERNOR GENERAL ACTS as the Queen when the Queen is not in town. This of course has nothing to do with \"HER MAJESTY\".\n\nWhen dealing with the LAW, in CANADA anyway, you are always dealing with \"HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA\", which as we all know is a CORPORATE ORGANIZATION.\n\n\"OR\" means you have a choice, \"one\" OR the \"other\", but not BOTH.\n\nSo, in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA, a PERSON can be \"HER MAJESTY\". A PERSON can be \"HER MAJESTY\", but a PERSON must also be an \"ORGANIZATION\". Notice it does not say \"OR\" an organization in the above interpretation. Confused yet?\n\nThat happens in Legalese. Let's, instead of looking at this dry, depressing CRIMINAL CODE stuff, look at something happy, exciting and real.\n\nI can say with absolute certainty that no woman on the planet has loved me more than Tara. However, no amount of love would compel her to JOINDER herself to a \"BILL OF LADING\", and hand it over to the GOVERNMENT. That means \"getting married\" (for the stupid amongst you). I'm sorry if that sounds condescending (that means talking down to people).\n\nNow think about this marriage transaction. The marriage INCLUDES \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", not \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\". This means marriage makes you effectively ONE PERSON UNDER THE LAW. Since the marriage actually consists of THREE ENTITIES, \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", which by its nature EXCLUDES the GOVERNMENT, still remains an \"ORGANIZATION\". A marriage ORGANIZES these \"entities\" into their respective roles. If \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\" remain \"Scott AND Tara\", the GOVERNMENT HAS NO STANDING. However, if Tara sought a divorce, the MARRIED PERSON is no longer \"Scott AND Tara\", and the GOVERNMENT gets to intervene.\n\nThis most certainly wouldn't be the case if it was \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\". Therefore, the above CRIMINAL CODE definition of \"PERSON\" defines HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ***INSERT PROVINCE HERE***, which is both \"HER MAJESTY\" AND an \"ORGANIZATION\".\n\nEvery one who is CHARGED in CANADA is usually CHARGED by their PROVINCE. For instance, if I were to take the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD lawyer \"Heather\" and bash her skull into jelly with a ball-peen hammer (as she so richly deserves), I would likely be CHARGED with HOMICIDE in the JURISDICTION where I chose to do this \"skull-bashing\". As I'm a profoundly lazy man I probably wouldn't travel, so ONTARIO would be the JURISDICTION. This makes \"HER MAJESTY\" AND the \"ORGANIZATION\", \"HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO\". Since all ACTS and STATUTES fall to PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of \"HER MAJESTY\", this makes all PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of \"HER MAJESTY\" effectively \"HER MAJESTY\". HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO is in fact, an \"ORGANIZATION\". You now have the qualifications for a \"PERSON\" as defined in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA.\n\nJust as the \"marriage\" consists of \"Scott AND Tara\", which effectively creates an \"ORGANIZATION\", \"HER MAJESTY\" and the organization defined as \"IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO\" create a \"PERSON\" which YOU are presumed to be a PUBLIC SERVANT of. This effectively means all CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS are simply administrative processes for that \"ORGANIZATION\". The NOTICE OF MISTAKE effectively removes that presumption.\n\nYou now see how powerful the words \"and\" and \"or\" are. If AQUILAE says the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is \"Scott AND Tara\", this would mean neither of us individually could act as CAPTAIN, but \"Scott and Tara\" could BOTH be CAPTAIN. This means that all ORDERS from the CAPTAIN must come from BOTH Scott AND Tara. However, the AQUILAE TRUST is not a stupid document, and the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott OR Tara. This means that when Tara speaks, everyone shuts the fuck up...including me. It's Scott OR Tara - not BOTH!\n\n\"AND\" refers to BOTH. \"OR\" does not. This is why putting \"and/or\" gives you the options; and since the AQUILAE TRUST is pretty much perfect, here in reality, the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott and/or Tara.\n\nThis means I can ACT as CAPTAIN, Tara can ACT as CAPTAIN, and we can BOTH ACT as CAPTAIN. Recipients of this POLICY have NO STANDING to contest when we assume and/or drop the role of CAPTAIN. Why do we do this, you ask? Because FUCK OFF, THAT'S WHY! If you're even looking at the AQUILAE TRUST, you're a fucking TRUSTEE; and the only reason you should be looking at the AQUILAE TRUST is to find the best way to \"Shut the fuck up and do what you're told\" for Scott and/or Tara....\n\nAnd that is how you make a powerful LEGAL document with the words \"and/or\", and the reason why we write things this way. Use AND & OR to restrict other parties. Use BOTH (and/or) to free yourself.\n\nIf your document is stating the terms, make it as open as possible for YOU, and as restrictive as possible for every OTHER PARTY. If somebody is thought of as a \"good lawyer\", it means they have mastered this skill. Were I to be practising law, I would be a very, very good lawyer.\n\nOne of our loyal readers made the horrendous mistake of using different words, in another post. Instead of NOTICE OF MISTAKE he said, NOTICE OF \"ERROR\", which means something completely different. If you look up the legal definition of \"mistake\" you will notice amongst other things (inter alia) the legal definition of \"MISTAKE\" ends with \", or error\". If you are going to learn from the TENDER FOR LAW, you must always remember the Number 1 Rule of the Universe:\n\nSCOTT IS ALWAYS RIGHT!\n\nYou can save yourself a lot of time by NOT second-guessing Scott, and proceeding to figure out WHY Scott is right.\n\nThis also means that when I present a document you should presume it's perfect, and that changing it will fuck you over in ways you don't even understand. \"NOTICE OF ERROR\" is not \"NOTICE OF MISTAKE\". You don't change the document because you think it \"sounds cooler\". You don't change the document because you think another cooler-sounding word means the same thing; and I will always interpret such changes as TENDERING AN OFFER to amuse me, by allowing me to berate you for your stupidity, and to laugh at you when a court kicks your ass. This is a TENDER I will gladly ACCEPT and volunteer for, with the added bonus that I will execute my duties in this TENDER to the best of my abilities. I'm really good at that too.\n\nTaking what you have just learned here and reading through ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, will reveal some very interesting and insidious things. You're better off serving me as a slave, because unlike ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, I won't lie to you, and I'll tell you exactly what I mean.\n\nSo there you have it, AND & OR - two hidden keys to legalese and the knowledge that \"include also excludes\"...and before you ask EXCLUDES includes all that remains. Use EXCLUDE to get rid of everything else; use INCLUDE to restrict to a single point/item.\n\nThe guy with the fake \"charity\" seeking legal advice actually asked what TENDER means, and it occurs to me that those who AREN'T lying to me might wonder too. TENDER in the context of Law means, \"to present to PERSON, an unconditional offer, to enter into a contract\". Look at those words, then look at a bank note. THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER means, \"THIS NOTE IS AN UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW\". That is why the group name is so clever. This group is ABOUT that UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW. It's ALL money.\n\nMoney is JOINDER. JOINDER MAY (Read as: \"ALWAYS DOES\") INCLUDE SURETY!\n\nTHIS is the LEGALESE you need to know. NO MORE. Your ONLY goal should be to REMOVE and/or AVOID SURETY when dealing in commerce and/or LAW. WHEN YOU SIGN A CHEQUE, you are TENDERING SURETY. A BANK NOTE does NOT THENDER SURETY as the SURETY is signed for, by SOMEBODY ELSE.\n\nIf you have OTHER LEGALESE questions, post them in the comments. OFF TOPIC COMMENTS WILL BE DELETED. LEGALESE IS A COMPLEX SUBJECT, SO BE PREPARED FOR VANISHING POSTS, and/or BANNING if you do post something OFF TOPIC.

As this is my forum, I think I will prevent the concept of TRUSTS being diminished any further by this scam.\n\nSo OPPF it is.\n\nBefore I get started about this, I'm going to raise another TRUST system. It should have died at the outset because one guy ends up with the money. I'm talking about bitcoin, except you can TRUST and VERIFY bitcoin. It is a mathematical process that requires no trust. You don't need to trust bitcoin any more than you need to trust 2 + 2 = 4; and that's why bitcoin is a perfectly viable currency until the guy who started it gets all the money.\n\nIt is an automated-accounting, self-regulated currency. Bitcoin is the by-product of our knowledge of fundamental universal truths regarding numbers. For math is a pure discipline. There's nothing more to learn about it, and trillions of undiscovered things you can do with what we know.\n\nI see a beauty and elegance, and even humour for those who can read the math in bitcoin. And that's why you can TRUST, because you get to VERIFY.\n\nNow let's look at the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD.\n\nThose that can't be bothered clogging up valuable intellect with bullshit, can reduce OPPF to its base components...and it basically goes like this...\n\nThree guys “reclaim” the world's wealth by way of the UCC, backed by the people in the TRUST. Except in every context with the UCC SERVICING NOTICE, etc., they are all LEGAL CLAIMS. The mere fact that you are GIVING NOTICE acknowledges the process. A TRUST cannot make aggressive moves like SERVING NOTICE and MAKING A CLAIM. A TRUST has AUTHORITY over what it RECEIVES. TRUSTS exist to fulfill a purpose based on ASSETS it has RECEIVED.\n\nA TRUST IS NOT A PERSON UNDER LAW.\n\nA TRUST IS NOT A PARTY UNDER LAW.\n\nAnd a TRUST can only RECEIVE.\n\nThe AQUILAE TRUST, for example, has a PRIMARY MANDATE to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to The House of Windsor. This is a relatively unattainable goal. I don't think I'll see Queen Elizabeth II saying, “Off with his head” in my lifetime, but that is, in fact, its PRIMARY MANDATE.\n\nAs it is a PRIVATE TRUST (PRIVATEER) we stand by to SERVE The House of Windsor. The House of Windsor can give AQUILAE an ORDER, and can TRUST that the ORDERS will be followed, even though The House of Windsor has no LEGAL or LAWFUL AUTHORITY over AQUILAE.\n\nEvery TRUSTEE is aware of this, and if 'Liz says, “Suit up and go to war”, we “Suit up and go to war”, because we said we would and she can TRUST us to do so.\n\nPROMISARY NOTES have the CREDIT and WORTH of those making the promises. ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD are making promises they cannot LEGALLY AND/OR LAWFULLY keep.\n\nIt is therefore reasonable to presume, based on the preponderance of EVIDENCE, that the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD exists SOLEY for the purpose of profiting from your credulity.\n\nYou have often heard me speak ill of Robert Menard, but I want you to pay close attention to what I speak. Robert Menard tells the absolute TRUTH about the law. In fact, I dare say you can almost (but not quite) TRUST what he says about law. If it's the TRUTH it doesn't matter who says it. 2 + 2 = 4. It doesn't matter if I say it, or if Robert Menard says it, or if Charles Manson says it...2 + 2 will still equal 4.\n\nHowever, Robert Menard lies through omission. If you ever want to see Robert Menard fumble around, and ask bullshit-deflecting questions, just ask him what “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER” means.\n\nONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD is FRAUD at the outset. Always remember the noble lie. If it requires BELIEF in anything, spirits, gods, fairies, etc., you are being sold FRAUD. There are no exceptions to this rule.\n\nFrom childhood you are sold the lie that faith and trust are equal, and they reinforce it with other lies like, “You must respect the beliefs of others.” Think about that for a second. Why must I respect the beliefs of others? Why have belief at all? If you examine the concept, belief is an end. It means you don't have to go looking any further. It means you can “just assume”, never having once examine WHY it should be believed.\n\nObserve the threads in this very forum. My mere public position that “your ignorance does not equal my knowledge” immediately gets a million ad hominem attacks. I collect the names you call me like trophies, and all of you that call me these things remind me that none of you are capable of having original thought.\n\nAll because I have offended your “beliefs”.\n\nAnd you enter with the arrogant position that if I don't believe what you do, there must be something wrong with me, which reveals your hypocrisy. You see, in order for you to have the opportunity to say these things about me, you most certainly would have had to initiate the communication; because the only reason you would talk to me is because you want my knowledge.\n\nI would not talk to you. Your very beliefs negate the possibility of UNDERSTANDING. You have nothing of VALUE for me, and presenting an “alternate view” which focuses on bullshit always seems to neglect to mention the fact that it is, in fact, focused on bullshit.\n\nIn short, belief has no VALUE. Those who say it does are selling you FRAUD, and you must always suspect the motives of those selling demonstrable FRAUD as TRUST.\n\nThe most primitive example of the self-imposed ignorance of belief can be found in Roman Numerals; and before I start with this I just want to remind everyone that the Ancient Greeks calculated the circumference of the earth, so the concept of zero was well-known throughout history. If you BELIEVE otherwise, examine the source of that belief and you will discover it is, in fact, bullshit.\n\nThe number zero represents fifty percent of all math in existence. If you do not understand that statement, and do not understand why that is, you are not qualified to speak of math. I digress...\n\nI think of my own personal knowledge of computer science, and the vast technological powers I wield simply because “nobody else knows how to do it.” I cringe in empathetic fear for humanity when I look upon its nine billion souls, all in some way, intimately tied to science and technology, and knowing nothing about science and technology. Even the most simple-minded amongst you cannot be so stupid that they cannot see this situation is a recipe for disaster.\n\nAnd every day, I'll hear some ignorant, credulous adult, with an imaginary friend, declare that I am ignorant, and that I am “closed-minded”, of course; and this is my personal favorite, that I'm “mentally ill” or some sub-category therein.\n\nThese people truly believe that their ignorance is wisdom, and that their belief equals my knowledge; and that is precisely why I DO NOT RESPECT THE BELIEFS OF OTHERS.\n\nLet's jump back in time to the Romans. The Romans had a technologically-evolving society. Mathematics and computer science were actually in heavy use, and numeric policy and process allowed those that could conceptualize the math to engineer aqueducts that are working to this day.\n\nComputer Science is profoundly powerful knowledge. I have the ability to literally speak to the universe, and it will speak back – in numbers. The test for intelligence is the test of understanding prime numbers, for these things are universal, and all of it requires not one scrap of belief.\n\nThose who don't see that only prove my point, because it's as true as 2 + 2 = 4...\n\n...and I'll demonstrate with the Romans.\n\nBookkeeping's a boring job, isn't it? Those who have been saddled with such a task will know what I'm describing when I speak of numbers dancing in your head, and you, being a pattern-seeking mammal, indulge yourself in the boredom by seeing how you make these numbers dance in a pattern you have not yet seen.\n\nThis is actually a very profound process and a lot of people miss it. The last thing the Romans wanted were smart bookkeepers. Bookkeepers make the rules. None of you see that. Watch “The Agenda” with Steve Paikin. VALE and the Chartered Accountants of Ontario sponsor the show, and they'll proudly tell you how long they've been setting PUBLIC POLICY.\n\nNone of you are aware of this, because none of you think; and Steve Paikin's shows are for people who can think, so there's zero risk of discovery.\n\nYou can see for yourself, your masters laughing at your idiocy.\n\nAll the belief in the world is not going to change that reality....\n\n...back to the Romans.\n\nA society that's growing as a result of computer science needs to hide the computer science part. I know more than you do by default. I've simply dedicated more time to any subject you raise than you have to studying it. It doesn't matter what you believe...this is simply true.\n\nI don't possess any mental powers you don't; and I don't possess any mental powers that the bookkeeper with “dancing-numbers-in-his-head” has.\n\nYou can see where this is going.\n\nDiscovery of computer science is inevitable, and accountants will find it first. I'm not going to find any gold in the Klondike if I don't go to the Klondike. You're not going to find computer science if you don't go to where math is used constantly.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to one simple goal. How do you stop a smart, little bookkeeper from discovering computer science, without affecting the quality of his work? Enter the Roman Numeral system.\n\nLiteracy was restricted to the upper casts; and the ignorant will leap and cling to what they can understand. In less than one generation the Roman Numeral system was injected into society with the DECLARATION, “This is math!”\n\n...and there you have it. The next generation will truly believe that Roman Numerals are actual numbers. They show the math function, and thus no one has reason to believe that the declaration, “This is math” was a lie, or that anyone's agenda was being served by believing that lie.\n\nSuch beliefs cause the believers of Roman Numerals to say that those “crazy people” who have no faith in the Roman Numeral system and their kooky religious terms like fast Fourier transform (FFT), Fibonacci Sequences, and calculus are just products of their ignorance...\n\n...is this sounding familiar?\n\nDo you get the idea?\n\nAnd so we return to ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD.\n\nIn the comments below I'll go step-by-step through the very base principles your beliefs have made you blind to. Unlike any other time in history, we all have the wealth of human knowledge at our fingertips. The ONLY weapon that those who work against your interests possess, is your ignorance. Belief is what gives ignorance VALUE to them.\n\nIgnorance serves those working against your interests.\n\nThe people who sell you these FRAUDS are so effective because they truly believe in them, and of course that belief serves another unseen agenda...\n\n...because the people that mean you harm, don't actually know you. It's not personal. You're a cow to be herded, because THEY took the time to learn things YOU didn't.\n\nAnd to the adults with imaginary friends, I dare say you attribute every “good” quality in you to that imaginary friend; and all the bad qualities in you, you attribute to yourself, because you're “a horrible wretched sinner” that needs “forgiving” for some unknown crime called “sin”.\n\nThere really are people that laugh at the fact that immorality is sold as morality. It gives them comfort that in 2013, declaring that you're an adult with an imaginary friend is not only “normal”, but is in fact a prerequisite for becoming President of the United States.\n\nI'm told that Governor of Alaska is another possibility too.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out why stating the truth is “ego”. It is always the first motivator that I'm accused of. I suspect it's loosely connected to the other strange belief that people's hurt feelings make my position wrong; and if they're Christian they seem to think some sort of harm should come to me as a result. They counter this vile thought with some empty expression of “love”, because Love hasn't been diminished by belief enough!\n\nYou have to see things from my perspective as well. When you declare that you're “offended”, there's an automatic process that I programmed, with intent in my head, and it routes all data from that point on, to the same place in my head that I route whining. For, in the end, when you say that you're offended, you should just presume that my response is, “So what?” You're whining does not change what I said.\n\nAll that being said, I request you, friends, comrades, brothers, sisters, to try to keep the banter to a minimum; and I know I'm as guilty as you are for this...\n\nI've had a good stern talk with myself on the subject regarding this thread.\n\nI am going to go through this whole document of THE ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD. We're going to play “Biology Class” with this piece of LEGAL BULLSHIT.\n\nI am going to put this fake “living document” (powered by “Belief”) on the stainless steel table, and while it cries out for mercy, I shall carve out its entrails, piece-by-piece. And we shall examine these entrails while it writhes in pain.\n\nAnd then we'll toss away those pieces because they don't survive the light of understanding. At the end of our little legal biology class, with two goals accomplished, you will see the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD for what it is, and I will have given it the slow and painful execution it so richly deserves.

I have to tell you, it's not going to let up in this article, because this article is about INSURANCE. We all know about INSURANCE. If you're driving, you HAVE to have INSURANCE. Hell if you want safe harbour anywhere, the harbour-master will demand that your boat have INSURANCE.\n\nSo let's look at the word. First the prefix \"in\". What does the prefix \"in\" mean? Well, look at all the words that I use to describe all of you - Inept, incompetent, incapable, insecure, insincere, indefensible, inexcusable, ineffective...I'm sure you guys are getting the idea. And the rest of the word just refers to surety. In the end it all refers to surety and accounting -- nothing else.\n\nIn order to completely remove surety (insure) another PERSON must take responsibility for your actions. This concept is in fact, FRAUD. Here in reality it's not what you know, it's what you can prove. I've leveraged that concept all my life. Let's assume as I type this, I KNOW I am responsible for at least three homicides; but can you prove it? Let's say you could. What if you decided I committed those homicides for the right reasons, and you decided that you were going to \"do the time\" for me. And while I certainly don't want to discourage people from doing really nice things for me, you serving the sentence for me does not actually absolve me of the responsibility. You're just taking the proverbial \"hit\" for me. Allowing you to do that time for me would be unethical in ways I won't even cover here, yet that morally repugnant concept is played out daily - with INSURANCE.\n\nAnother PERSON assumes SURETY for your actions. This is why INSURANCE companies still refer to natural events/disasters as \"Acts of God\". A delusional Christian fuck-wit brings this up weekly as though their INSURANCE policy validates the existence of God.\n\nThis is one of many uses for the Abrahamic religions. They socially-engineer concepts like INSURANCE so they are elevated from blatant unethical FRAUD to a necessity for daily life, and they will say you are foolish, or a bad person, for not having INSURANCE.\n\nHow did they manage to pull that off? In my above homicide scenario, I explained the FRAUD in plain, unambiguous terms. Only the most ethically bankrupt amongst you will miss the point. The reason it has never occurred to you, is because of everybody's favourite zombie-rape-baby, Jesus H. Christ.\n\nAs a little side note to Christians, as it may not have occurred to them, it's NOT OK to impregnate women in their sleep! This should seem obvious but you're a Christian -- so you can never be too sure.\n\nAnyway...where was I? ...Jesus the zombie-rape-baby...right.\n\nThe whole Christian doctrine revolves around the assertion that Jesus-zombie-rape-baby died for your sins. Only Christians seem to be able to determine what these \"sins\" are; however, apparently having sex is a sin, and murder is a sin; hell, even thought crimes (impure thoughts) are sins. But don't you worry, you horrible, wretched thing, Jesus the zombie-rape-baby has died for your sins. And if you can believe that, well then, Bob's Universal All-encompassing mega INSURANCE policy (don't forget to read the fine print) is for you (Act now, 'cause you know we can't do this all day)!\n\nOne of the things all of you have to realize, especially the Christians, is that the entire history of the world was rewritten in the 1500's. Shakespeare was introduced to inject \"legalese\" into the vernacular of the Angols. Translate any copy of THE MAGNA CARTA and you will notice no legalese ever appears in it. And my personal favourite is Christians that wave around the KING JAMES BIBLE. I can't make this any simpler. It says right on the fucking cover who is scamming you!\n\nEverything in the nobility is executed by APPOINTMENT, from social engineering projects like the KING JAMES BIBLE, to Dunhill cigarettes, because the Queen likes a certain type of tobacco. These products and \"services\" are executed with the presumption that they are in compliance with the Sovereign's wishes, and notice is given on the product itself that it was created by APPOINTMENT, by the entity who appointed it.\n\nThe KING JAMES BIBLE was APPOINTED by King James. The technology had reached the point were mass production of print medium was possible. This meant that social engineering that normally relied on \"word-of-mouth\" could now have rigid change-control introduced. This meant the instructions for selling your daughter into slavery was consistent throughout the Commonwealth. This also introduced the concept of an imaginary rape baby taking responsibility for all the bad shit you do. Seriously that's what you \"bought\". There are people reading this who believe this to be true.\n\nThe whole \"dying\" thing is also a scam. That's the zombie part. Zombie-rape-baby-Jesus supposedly came back to life three day's after he died. Where's the sacrifice? He wasn't even out of commission long enough for his relatives to start fighting over his stuff. The very notion that \"Jesus died for your sins\" is nullified by the fact that he stopped being dead. He didn't die for your sins, he had a bad weekend for your sins...and he slept through most of it. OK, I'm really Christian-bashing here. Let's split the difference and say, \"Jesus was sightly inconvenienced for your sins.\"\n\nI understand he was inconvenienced on a long weekend, too, which makes it really...bad?\n\nI'm sorry, I'm really trying to ascertain how this equals all the bad shit you do. You Christians will claim this Jesus guy will absolve me of any wrongdoing because of the \"sacrifice\" he made, but I'm not seeing where this sacrifice is. I'm not mentioning this because I'm looking for convincing. I'm from that same group of guys that made this book, and that's where the argument becomes moot.\n\nI can't stress this enough, but I'm one of the guys that's in on the scam.\n\nYou'll constantly hear me say, \"Stop studying the clubhouse rules, because you're not in the club.\" I'm descended from the founders of the club. I would rather live in poverty than to live off your labour; although my position on this has been on a sliding scale of late. Of all the clubhouse rules, the bible in any form, should be avoided at all costs. It should be fought at every possible opportunity, and should be met with all the ridicule and contempt you can throw at it...\n\n...because it deserves no less. It is an ethically bankrupt FRAUD...just like INSURANCE.\n\nIf you think I can make Christianity sound retarded, wait until I cover INSURANCE.\n\nSo let's zoom back to when you were 16-years-old. You can't vote, you can't drink, there's a question mark as to whether you can legally have sex according to where you reside, but there is one thing you can do -- you can drive.\n\nHence you engage in the ego-building act of getting \"permission to learn\" from the government. So, at the whim of a paper-pusher who couldn't get a job in the real world, you will hopefully be given permission to learn; and you will have proof that you have this permission when you produce a LEARNER'S PERMIT. And so every good Christian goes through this RIGHT OF PASSAGE where they are granted permission to learn. Gee willikers, it's awfully swell that the government gave you permission to learn, huh?\n\nBut you're just sixteen, remember? You're not old enough to know of the real pitfalls of life...like dames and broads trying to play you for a sap (I'm laughing as I type this, because 1950's movie-speak is almost as retarded as this generations's pop-culture slang).\n\nNow in order to exercise your newly-acquired \"permission to learn\" you're going to need a vehicle, perhaps a car, which is a contraction of carriage...which is a LEGAL term, so don't use it. But since you're trying to be \"LEGAL\", having been granted \"permission to learn\" (seriously am I the only one who finds that the most demeaning thing ever written on paper?), a car will do just nicely. But what if you get into an accident? It won't occur to you that accident is just that - an accident. There is no SURETY, real or implied, for something that's accidental. That's what makes it an accident! There is no intent behind the damage. But if you subjugate yourself to a PERSON, that PERSON will assume full SURETY for any damages, and like zombie-rape-baby-Jesus, this PERSON only exists on paper. All of you consider it so real, that people are jailed regularly for \"Driving without INSURANCE\". It sort of \"drives\" the point home, doesn't it?\n\nYou have been pre-programmed to accept this subjugation, this ridiculous, FRAUDULENT, morally-bankrupt subjugation is a LEGAL necessity, and all of it deals with MONEY OF ACCOUNT. MONEY OF EXCHANGE never touches the equation. For those of you who are too lazy and/or stupid to learn the difference between MONEY OR ACCOUNT and MONEY OF EXCHANGE, one dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT is only capable of buying and/or cancelling another dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT. 90% of all money in the world is this type of money. It's pretend. It's not real. It only applies to the clubhouse rules, and it competes directly with the money in your pocket. This is the dynamic that everyone misses.\n\nI hear lots of extremely accurate descriptions of how MONEY OR ACCOUNT is created, and they all come from idiots who know nothing about what money is. They'll go off on some tangent about Lou Manotti and his evil henchmen, the Freemasons.\n\nOnce again I'd like to digress and remind everyone that on every occasion that I required a mason, free did not enter into the equation. Masons are fucking expensive, and there's no such thing as a free one.\n\n...where was i?\n\nAs yes...MONEY OF ACCOUNT versus MONEY OF EXCHANGE.\n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW is primarily about the money that carries that TENDER. There are lots of learned men who will talk endlessly about law. I have forgotten more about law than all of these men combined have ever learned. I say men because a woman's brain simply would not be able to encompass the blatant lies that the travesty that we call law spews at them. Reading the writings of Mary Elizabeth Croft will provide you with one example of what goes through a thinking-woman's mind when law is actually analyzed. You'll notice the things I teach you here from a law perspective, are really simple. They are all created with the intent of getting you out of accounting and surety. I have declared publicly on the record that the TENDER FOR LAW that money provides is, in fact, a FRAUD. Most of you reading this are probably already painfully aware of this fact.\n\nMy entire life plan relied on the RULE OF LAW remaining intact, but when the time came for me to assert my RIGHTS under that rule, the pretence became blatant. Anyone else going through what I have, would have been defeated; but as I constantly point out, I'm descended from an evil, vile, pseudo-culture...and I've forgotten more about law than any of these people will ever know. There are lawyers that will testify to that fact, so it's not like this should come as a surprise, but I have documented EVERYTHING. If it was spoken as regards me, I have a recording of it. If any name over which I have executive authority has been used in a document, I have a copy of it. Laid out on a time-line, the blatant FRAUD becomes irrefutable, conclusive proof of what everybody already knows.\n\nI mention all this because what I'm describing is, INSURANCE. Notice that my INSURANCE is a little different than the good neighbours at, \"State Farm\". It's designed to put the SURETY where it belongs -- not with me. The difference between the good neighbours at State Farm and me, is that I am not subjugating myself. My INSURANCE is real. It exists in the real world, and the more astute among you will see that I am pushing it all into a universe of virtual worlds.\n\nWhen you understand what money is, you can construct money through VALUE.\n\nIf it exists in the real world, it has VALUE. Any currency used to track that VALUE, when exchanging goods, is MONEY OF EXCHANGE.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, does not exist in the real world. Only its mysterious creators have any COPYHOLD on the VALUE. That's the thing about Bitcoin - in the end the guys that created it, get all the money. They get this because people volunteer to take alpha-test-grade, proof-of-concept code, and open their computers up to the Internet. They then give hardware-level access to their memory, processor, GPU and hard drive, to a rogue, autonomous process that their empty, little heads couldn't even dream of understanding, with no one paying attention to its original intent -- which is to prove that it could be done.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are people who are doing this on purpose, because the VALUE is returned almost immediately. For Bitcoin has all the properties of gold, without the liabilities. Bitcoin is but one cryptographic currency. AQUILAE has its own cryptographic currency. It cannot be counterfeited, and is a near-perfect accounting mechanism. AQUILAE is not even a PERSON, it's a TRUST. If a TRUST can have a currency, why can't you? What I am building for everyone here, is a method to remove the middle-man. If you have your own currency, you don't need a bank. If cryptographic currencies can't be counterfeited, then it's trade cannot be regulated. It remains within the private realm and the ease at which you can convert your currency to MONEY OF EXCHANGE anywhere in the world, is directly proportional to your VALUE. In the current economic framework, backed by debt-based FIAT currency, the only legitimate path to wealth is to produce, to make something in the real world that didn't exist before.\n\nLike every dollar in existence, all things of VALUE have a creation date and a death date. Whatever you produce must be built with that in mind. For instance, producing a plaque with a cheesy-Jesus slogan on it, actually has VALUE. Perhaps it has VALUE to its creator, but here in reality, that plaque with the cheesy-Jesus slogan, will find its way to a landfill very quickly.\n\nThis very article you are reading has a creation date, and a death date, and this is becoming apparent with the four threads that just magically disappeared here. Pierre destroyed the thread where he was bestowed his sacred, native name. The thread itself had VALUE, for it reflected the culture from whence Pierre came. The colloquial term, \"fucking the dog\" refers to bored, unionized workers taking their one-hour breaks between their fifteen minutes of actual labour. Look at any road crew in Quebec and you will see a working example of \"fucking the dog.\" And so, Fucks the Puppy was bestowed upon Pierre as an homage, and in an irrational fit of nameless rage Pierre destroyed the thread, which by the way, is the most labour I've ever seen out of labourer in Quebec. Ok, I don't really feel that way about people from Quebec. Don't quote me on it, but I'm pretty sure there's an act or statute somewhere in Ontario that says I must make fun of people from Quebec. I'm also pretty sure there's an equivalent act or statute for people in Quebec to refer to people in Ontario. Truth be told, one of the most inspirational people in my lifetime was Rene Levesque, and I strongly suggest that every single reader look at the history of this awesome shit-disturber.\n\nQuebec politicians do some awesome things. For example, if you want to see awesome, political suicide, no one will ever beat Jacques Parizeau...but I digress again...\n\nWe were talking about INSURANCE.\n\nMy INSURANCE is my life plan. It's way off track, and I need to get it back on track. But my life plan relied on the Rule of Law remaining intact. And while we weren't looking, our RIGHTS got sold, and nobody bothered consulting us. My INSURANCE company went bust. The Rule of Law is not intact, and in my eyes they have forfeitted the right to exist; because I've made it very clear, that limited liability is a fallacious concept, and if I stand by and watch the GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO operating as \"JUSTICE\", victimize the PUBLIC whose TRUST it holds, I become no better than you. I have a life plan that I must return to. I have a defective government process posing as \"JUSTICE\" and victimizing the citizens it has sworn to serve.\n\nTo return to my life plan under these circumstances is to make myself an enabler; and so I have a problem. For whether I like it or not, I'm one of the good guys, and it's not a role I'm comfortable with. There are many reasons for this, one of them being that to be the good guy, I have to do both. I have to get \"a\" Rule of Law in place, one that serves the interests of the people it governs. Since I love spewing out spoilers I'm going to give the end of the story away RIGHT NOW! Why am I destroying your journey of discovery by giving away the ending? Because, FUCK YOU, that's why! I may be the good guy, but I don't have to be nice about it.\n\nThe only way to LEGALLY and LAWFULLY do what I propose is to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to the Monarchy for a period not exceeding five years. From this moment forward a primary focus of those who follow what I am teaching should be an investigation into why this is true. It is the only possible answer that has any chance of success. Over the next few weeks we will explore why giving executive power to a little old lady of Germanic descent, and nine Corgees, is a good idea. AND, because I'm right, everybody is going to find out the hard way, that it is impossible to prove that I'm wrong. That's what makes it right!\n\nAs I explain, step-by-step, how I intend to accomplish this lofty goal, it will become readily apparent that I already have everything in place. I've planned for what's to come. AND, before shit gets real, I'm going to train you all up to a level where you can think in a useful manner. By useful, I mean to YOU, because you currently think wrong, and VALUE the wrong things. It may be difficult to hear, but you're programmed to be a useless, sack-of-shit. If you should produce any VALUE, the government is there to lie to you about that VALUE, and to trick you into thinking you owE THEM for being VALUEable. If I'm successful, all that stolen VALUE will be returned to the people it was stolen from. But what happens at the end of that five years? You see Elizabeth Windsor is the KEEPER OF THE TRUST. You see a little, old lady. I see an echo of a little girl that the world knew as Princess Elizabeth -- and her plea to the Commonweath to come to her aid. This is the SOVEREIGN OF THE COMMONWEALTH, and she didn't choose it. My grandfather taught me all I needed to know to TRUST Elizabeth Windsor. When the power is handed to her, she'll know what to do with it, because she knows that even if she fails at what is surely a lifetime of planning, she has you and I, as INSURANCE.\n\nWhile this sinks in...

Myths about THIS shit, sure has “done the rounds”, hasn't it? No more myths have been generated, out of a piece of regulation, than the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE!\n\nThe dumbed-down, but very accurate, explanation is that the UCC is a standardized LEGAL mechanism, to resolve disputes in commerce, where such commerce utilizes the world reserve currency.\n\nAt the moment, the world reserve currency is the US DOLLAR. This doesn't mean it's American law, but it most certainly covers the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA and all the US shores and waterways.\n\nITS DEFAULT ROLE IS TO DETERMINE JURISDICTION\n\nIf you watched Money as Debt III, you saw a brief explanation as to WHY gold became a world currency. It was universally accepted, around the world.\n\nThe UCC provides this very same function by being the very LAW you TENDERED when you used the US DOLLAR. This effectively means the UCC covers the UNITED STATES and any JURISDICTIONS, real or implied, which can and/or do use the US DOLLAR.\n\nIn order to make use of the UCC, you must either be in the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, and/or in one of the waters, shores or tributaries of the UNITED STATES, and/or conducting business in US DOLLARS.\n\nI, for one, love the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE. If you have a fleet of ships and you do business in AMERICAN DOLLARS, and don't have any debt, you're pretty much as free as a human being can get in 2013.\n\nIf there is anyone that says the UCC is anything else, they are, in fact, lying to you. The purpose behind the UCC is to have COMMON INTERNATIONAL LAW regarding COMMERCE. ABOVE ALL;ITS DEFAULT ROLE IS TO DETERMINE JURISDICTION!\n\n...idiots. (Yes, as a matter of fact I DO have to say that! FUCK OFF!)\n\nThe UCC allows certain presumptions regarding accounting that would simply be impractical in a corporate environment. The fact that roles are clearly defined, and MARITIME ADMIRALTY LAW is heavily integrated, makes owning a ship, or even better, a fleet of ships, a very liberating idea, for the UCC protects you. The UCC guarantees that other users of THE TENDER FOR LAW that offered this JURISDICTION, will protect your interests by presumption.\n\nThis whole “Dean arrest thing” has distracted me from my larger goal, and now I have to stop and dumb things down. I certainly hope my explanation of the UCC is clear enough.\n\nNow ponder how stupid a CLAIM against such “constructs” actually is.\nOK, you know what?...you're all too stupid...I'm going to have to explain it.\n\nLet's cover a few fundamentals. I'll try not to use large words so the “BELIEVERS” won't get confused.\n\nA TRUST IS NOT A PERSON.\n\nA GOVERNMENT IS NOT A PERSON, AND\n\nA JUDICIARY IS NOT A PERSON.\n\nA human that is registered with the NON-PERSON GOVERNMENT IS A PERSON.\n\nA human, and that stripper they fucked last year and has since squirted out a NEW human, and THEREFORE, said NEW human is registered with the NON-PERSON GOVERNMENT IS A PERSON. (That's what you get for fucking strippers)\n\nA CORPORATION IS A PERSON.\n\nONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD poses as a “TRUST”. A TRUST cannot make a CLAIM. Only a PERSON can make a CLAIM.\n\nThe GRANTORS of the TRUST have NO STANDING to make a CLAIM once the TRUST is commissioned. They have no more power to do so than the guy, whose signature is on a Ten Dollar bill, has the AUTHORITY to tell you how to spend it.\n\nONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, and their ilk, will happily talk as EXPERTS on the UCC, and I'm pretty sure NONE of them has actually used the UCC.\n\nSo, let's do a side-by-side comparison as to who is more qualified to speak on this subject:\n\nI, unlike OPPF and “FREELOADERS-ON-THE-LAND”, have actual VALUE. As I type this the general consensus of the LEGAL AND BANKING SYSTEM says that I can, without question, UNDERWRITE half a Billion Dollar's worth of BONDS converted to MONEY OF EXCHANGE. Think about that. On a whim, I could inject half a Billion Dollars into the economy. This means that unless you use those dollars to purchase my value, the entire net worth of the country will drop by half a Billion Dollars.\n\nIf you think it's frightening that one privileged man wields the power to do this sort of thing, pat yourself on the back because that is the proper response. Ethics is the only thing that stops me from doing that. But that doesn't really help much in COMMERCE. An ethical guy with a gun, in the end, is still just a guy with a gun....\n\n….Enter the UCC.\n\nThe UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE in COMMERCE, only recognizes whatever currency is the world reserve currency. This of course is the US DOLLAR. This means that every other currency touched by the INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND is simply “acting” as a US DOLLAR (or part thereof).\nMuammar Gaddafi was wiped off the face of the earth, because he dared point out that the world's currencies are propping-up the dead, hollowed-out carcass that is the UNITED STATES. He raised the point that, according to the little, green book that got him into office, He was pretty sure that LIBYA'S economic wealth was to go to its people.\n\nI hear people stating that the war on LIBYA was ILLEGAL. Sadly it wasn't. The UCC made it perfectly LEGAL.\n\nLAW IS A TRUST. According to the TRUST, Gaddafi's attempt to change the currency was a BREACH OF THAT TRUST.\n\nTHE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE can be viewed as the grand, de facto law that exists where no other de facto law exists.\n\nTherefore according to IMF TREATIES, if there's no law at a particular place, the UCC is DEEMED to be the de facto law.\n\nYou will notice that there is nothing to LIEN or FORECLOSE ON in the UCC. UCC is a “legal traffic cop”, directing traffic to its appropriate JURISDICTION.\n\nTreating a TRUST like a PERSON makes any further documents produced as a result, FRAUD. Such documents are OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT.\n\nIn short, ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD is, by its very nature, based on an ILLEGAL concept.\n\n...but that's not the worst of it. UCC, like any OTHER TRUST is based on CONSENT. Let's look into LEGAL UTOPIA! We needn't bother with silly things like consent. IT'S LEGAL PARADISE! First we must get into the right “headspace”.\n\nSince all of you like to form uninformed opinions of me, and what a bad man I am, I'll put this next scenario in the context of “me”, because your self-created loathing of me will allow you to accept this concept, in your empty little heads.\n\nSO, Imagine if you will that I, the KEEPER OF THE AQUILAE TRUST, decided that I wanted to do something FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, because you're too stupid to do it yourself. With the arrogant presumption that I even have STANDING to do so, I, without your CONSENT, make a DECLARATION that you get a “chunk of the world's wealth”; and to ENFORCE that I drafted some AWESOME LAWS, as I do not “believe” (belief is the only thing that would cause a rational human being to think this way) you are capable of managing your own affairs...\n\n...hey wait, this is starting to sound familiar. But I'm not like the GOVERNMENT, I know what's best for you! I'm just here to help; and anybody who doesn't want that help is clearly a “hater”, and are jealous... maybe even criminals and psychopaths. Why, anybody who doesn't want my help is mentally ill. That's safe to say! In fact, I'd better amend my awesome laws so that I may lovingly and humanely dispose of these mentally ill.\n\nGot the picture?\n\nGOOD.\n\nNow just replace “me” with those “three guys” in ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, and that is what is being sold to you. I cannot make this any clearer.\n\nI have just explained what the UCC is. If you think it's anything else, you're “making shit up”.\n\nI use the UCC daily. AQUILAE has points-of-presence in CANADA, THE UNITED STATES, SINGAPORE, SCOTLAND and ICELAND. So anybody who dares say they know more about the UCC is publicly declaring that I am LEGALLY INCOMPETENT TO MANAGE A TRUST, which is DEFAMATORY; and I deal with that in MY JURISDICTION, and there's a nice “legal traffic cop” that says I can. People who want to continue spreading bullshit may find themselves on my “LEGAL AUTOPSY TABLE” where they are used as a live example...\n\n...Because ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD has a lot more than the UCC. I could show mercy right now and let this FRAUD die as it is; and even though I made some grandiose promises about this document's horrible fate, I remind you all that mercy is the mark of a GREAT MAN!\n\n...The problem is, I'm just a GOOD man.\n\nIn my next major post I shall cover the procedural FRAUD within the TRUST itself as laid-out in its CHARTER DOCUMENTS.\n\nWatch how it writhes in pain. * maniacal giggling is permitted * "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_602364533132816","body":"Scott Duncan\nOne of the key components of the Noble Lie, is the useful imaginary friend they make to give \"chosen\" people, all the rights.

I don't have to post \"evidence\". I'm not trying to PROVE anything to you.\n\nThat said, this is not a debate centre either. You assume ALL LIABILITY when you ask to join this group. This, by default, means you have \"SURETY\", because SURETY equals LIABILITY. I don't need to provide \"proof\" of this; as my banning you from the group should be compelling enough to show the difference between who's in charge, and who's liable.\n\nBefore we get to the actual issue of SURETY, and why you must avoid it, we must take a quick journey back in time to learn where the legalese that enjoins you came from.\n\nThose of you who endured the content-free 1.2 decades of the Public Fool System, will remember certain things, not the least of which is Shakespeare. The plays of Shakespeare are sold to you as \"Olde English\". In fact, it was sold as \"Olde English\" when these were first-run plays. There is a problem with this, though. Nobody ever spoke in the manner that Shakespeare wrote, and they most certainly never used the words. Shakespeare produced most of his major works between 1589 and 1613, all of which were sold as \"Olde English\". Popular periodicals of the time show that you were often considered \"learned and of good taste\" if you could speak in this \"Olde English\".\n\nSo let's go read some really, really Olde English.\n\nLet's pick a really old English document, completely at random. We'll pick...The MAGNA CARTA.\n\nA quick read of the MAGNA CARTA will swiftly reveal two things. The first is that that it's pretty readable, not backward and convoluted like a Shakespeare play. There may be a few archaic words you may need to look up (to ascertain their meanings), but it's still pretty readable, and there are no words that Shakespeare used. There's also no letter \"U\". This is a very important fact to remember, because *spoiler alert*, when courts or legal documents refer to \"YOU\", they are in fact, granting you SURETY in the matter. If you look at a WARRANT, or a ticket from a Policy Enforcement Officer, it will have a name and it will then refer to that name as \"YOU\" from then on. For example, \"JOHN Q PUBLIC, YOU have been charged with (insert bullshit offence here)\".\n\nYOU=SURETY\n\nIf you're ever in a courtroom and do not wish to have the \"benefit of SURETY\", you have but to object to being addressed as \"YOU\". There are many ways to do this. Dean Clifford might say, in response to being addressed as \"YOU\", \"If I have led the court to believe that I am SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE. Please forgive me.\" (FUN FACT: A court MUST ALWAYS grant forgiveness when asked and/or requested)\n\nOthers, like myself, are a lot more succinct. For example, I might respond, \"FUCK YOU! You're a YOU, I'm a ME! By what AUTHORITY do YOU address ME as a \"YOU\"?\", because I can get away with it. The reason I can get away with it is that I UNDERSTAND the UCC as opposed to ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD which spreads mythology and bullshit about the UCC.\n\nNow there may be a certain \"pretend radio\" talk-show host (who speaks in a manner that would suggest he is hosting a show with a dick in his mouth), who would demand \"proof of this\", ignoring the fact that the UCC is, in fact, the proof.\n\nSection 1, Subsection 308, of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE covers RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. This is a well-known fact, and this is how you use it.\n\nOn entering the court, you aggressively make the first motion, that being, the RESERVATION OF YOUR RIGHTS. But since you're the only one in the courtroom with ACTUAL STANDING, you can be a total dick about it. You don't RESERVE YOUR RIGHTS, you RESERVE ALL RIGHTS! Not just yours, EVERYONE's. You remove everyone else's rights and give them to yourself. WHY? Because \"Fuck off that's WHY!\" You're the only one with STANDING.\n\nIf you HOLD the power, WIELD it...don't be such a pussy! If you're entitled to ALL RIGHTS, CLAIM THEM. This is how you do it.\n\nWhen the \"justice\" starts speaking, interrupt them. Say, \"Point of order!\" They will immediately be silent. At that point, state \"I believe I am the only party with standing, so barring objection from the court, I wish to RESERVE ALL RIGHTS now, and henceforth. Are there any objections from the court?\" As the court has no standing to respond, simply speak to the record as such, \"Let the record show that I have reserved all rights, and the court has not objected.\" At this point if they say anything to you, you simply say, \"Objection. The record shows that I have reserved all rights, and I have not granted you leave to speak. Why are you speaking?\"\n\nDo the same when opposing counsel attempts to speak. You will then be posed the question, \"How do you wish to proceed in this matter?\" for that is the one question a slave has the right to ask. What is their master's wish?\n\nYou'll recall in other articles and comments, the levels of the caste system and how they give instructions.\n\nNOBILITY (KINGS AND QUEENS) EXPRESS THEIR \"WISHES\".\n\nADMIRALTY ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS BY REQUESTING, ADDRESSING THEIR SUBORDINATES AS \"MR\".\n\nGENERALS GIVE ORDERS.\n\nNow even the talk-show host who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth, won't \"demand proof\" of the fact that if you have all the rights, and everybody else has none, you are CLEARLY the KING. So you are going to have to learn to give instruction by expressing your wishes. This is why they are asking how you \"wish to proceed\". Courts grant and test your SOVEREIGNTY all the time. You simply have to listen to the words they are using. At this time you may respond, \"I wish to prove to some ass-wipe who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth, the things I know, so I wish to go to trial PRO SE. But I wouldn't recommend this...I would simply wish the case to be dismissed.\n\nIf they say anything else besides \"I agree, case dismissed\", you exercise your AUTHORITY by questioning. MASTERS QUESTION, SLAVES ANSWER. For instance if a \"justice\" said anything except \"I agree. Case dismissed,\" you question why they are even speaking. \"I'm sure you'll recall Mr. (insert justice's name here) that at the beginning of these proceedings I explicitly reserved all rights, including yours. Have I not made my wishes clear?\"\n\nAlways remember to respond in the form of a question. A question serves the dual-purpose of establishing your authority, and negating the possibility of UNDERSTANDING; because if you UNDERSTAND, you accept SURETY.\n\nAs stated before, the most powerful of these questions is, \"Who are you?\" UNDERSTANDING cannot be presumed until that question is answered.\n\nAbove all, questioning deflects SURETY.\n\nQuite possibly one of the most useful documents I have ever published is my NOTICE OF MISTAKE for Dean. This is a useful, powerful document that also instantly removes SURETY. I framed it in such a way that you can replace the name \"Dean Clifford\" with your name, and you can make a pad of these things. Have lots of copies to hand out to friends and opposing counsel. Hell the court clerk loves these things too...make sure the court clerk has one as well. Just make sure you UNDERSTAND what the document says. Read it carefully and understand what the words mean, because you will be challenged. And remember, the NOTICE by its very nature, presents several questions.\n\nDo not permit the proceedings to move forward without these questions being answered!\n\nBecause so many people ask for it, transcribed here is the copy of THE ROGUESUPPORT NOTICE OF MISTAKE.\n\n***Begin NOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nIn the matter of SURETY for the LEGAL NAME, I believe that there has been a\nMISTAKE as the SOLE BENEFICIARY has been INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED as the\naccused. If I, AND/OR PERSONS AND/OR FRIENDS OF THE COURT AND/OR\nSUCH OTHER PARTIES ACTING IN MY INTERESTS, have led the COURT to believe\nby responding to “You” and or “DEAN CLIFFORD” and/or SUCH OTHER\nIDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, that I am the PARTY\nWITH SURETY in this matter, then that would be a MISTAKE and please forgive\nme.\n\nAs I have no knowledge of who “You” and or “DEAN CLIFFORD” and/or SUCH\nOTHER IDENTIFICATION THIS COURT HAS ADDRESSED ME AS, I RESPECTFULLY\nASK; by WHAT AUTHORITY is the COURT ADDRESSING me as such?\nAs the SURETY BOND (BIRTH CERTIFICATE) has been deposited into the COURT,\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I, as the SOLE BENEFICIARY of the\nTRUST have any SURETY in this matter?\n\nAs the GOVERNMENT is the SOLE SIGNATORY PARTY on the SURETY BOND\n(BIRTH CERTIFICATE), with SOLE AND FULL SURETY as TRUSTEE for the LEGAL\nNAME, WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE for the\nLEGAL NAME. WHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am a TRUSTEE and\nhave ANY SURETY with respect to the LEGAL NAME?\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a\nTRUSTEE or an EMPLOYEE of the CROWN?\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have of any WARRANT OF AGENCY for the\nprincipal?\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE does the COURT have that there has been any meeting of the\nminds, any PROPER NOTICE given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or\nthat I have ANY INTENT to CONTRACT in this matter?\n\nAs such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and\nCLOSURE.\nAUTHORISED BY:\n\n***End NOTICE OF MISTAKE\n\nIf you truly UNDERSTAND what this document says and/or does, this is one of the most powerful documents you can wield in court. If you have the Dunning–Kruger effect you will likely go to jail. Used properly the NOTICE OF MISTAKE will ALWAYS remove any real or implied SURETY the court believes you may have.\n\nYou will notice the court always refers to \"belief\". When I say belief is evil, it is not just a disparaging remark against adults with \"imaginary friends\" (which they totally deserve), it is yet another example of why this statement is profoundly true. All belief is evil.\n\nYou are taught from childhood to \"respect belief\", and are constantly reinforced with the really dumb freedom that it is your \"right to believe what you want\". If I had the authority and/or power to remove just one right from humanity, and no more, the right to \"believe\" would be the one that I would eradicate. In all my years of studying, and being part of the Nobility, the curtailing of this one \"RIGHT\" would exponentially increase quality of life for all humanity. I calculate it would take two generations for it to \"stick\".\n\nBelief is the end of questioning. Belief is intellectual bankruptcy, and is the exact opposite of knowledge. You will never question if you \"believe\".\n\nLet's leap back to the 1500's to Shakespeare. This is where the concept of addressing somebody as \"YOU\" indicated the assignment of SURETY. No writings before this contained any such logistic mechanisms. Don't \"believe me\"...go look for yourself. Go look at the MAGNA CARTA yourself; and ask yourself why there's no \"YOU\" before Shakespeare. And ask yourself why the MAGNA CARTA, in all its current published forms, no longer has, \"To do right by Alexander\".\n\nThere may be three readers amongst you who understand what I just said there, and all of them are Scottish I guarantee you.\n\nIn any courtroom proceeding in the western world, SURETY IS PRESUMED, and it must be deflected from you. As a \"justice\" is not a PERSON under the law, the only PARTY that can ACCEPT SURETY is the PARTY making the CLAIM.\n\nThere may be certain readers who talk like they have a dick stuck in their mouth, who will demand proof of this...and so I direct you to the Rules of Civil Procedure (wherever you are) to look up SECURITY FOR COSTS.\n\nLet's zoom back to the present (so we can get as far away from belief as possible) where the word \"YOU\" is part of the English language, as are the titles, \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", and \"Mrs.\". All of these titles and means of addressing you, are in fact, assigning and/or presuming SURETY...yes, on YOU. The easiest mnemonic exercise you can do to make deflecting these titles second nature is to replace the titles \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", or \"Mrs.\" with the word, \"bitch\", in your head; and to respond as if they had addressed you as \"bitch\", because being addressed as \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", or \"Mrs.\" is doing exactly that.\n\nAs for the word \"YOU\", think of that as a tennis ball which must be served back. Assert your AUTHORITY by questioning whenever they address you as \"YOU\"; \"Are YOU addressing ME?\" If they're stupid enough to say yes, or even to imply the affirmative, be like that guy who talks like he has a dick in his mouth and demand proof; \"By what authority do YOU address me as a PARTY OF SURETY?\"...or something along those lines. Your only objective is to serve the \"YOU\" back to them.\n\nSo that's today's word, \"SURETY\". It's something you don't want, and I've just shown you how to give it back. I'd like to thank my involuntary guests, Dean Clifford, and the guy that talks like he's got a dick in his mouth. Since I was so liberal with their identities, I certainly have no problem putting in a free plug for a \"pretend radio\" show.\n\nSo here's a link to Dean Clifford talking about family court rules or something...hosted by a guy who sounds like he's got a dick in his mouth. And before Pierre thinks I've \"soft-balled this one in there\" for him, I'm now going to presumptively say, \"Yes Pierre, I'm pretty sure it's Dean's dick he's sucking\".\n\nhttp://www.blogtalkradio.com/globalfactradio/2013/03/12/how-to-with-dean-clifford-ep13-family-law\n\n...because when Scott Duncan does a plug, he does it hard core!

This is based on the premise that the contract will be the result of a meeting-of-the-parties'-minds, or CONSENSUS AD IDEM, on the terms and conditions that will form the contract. \n\nThe first requirement of a contract is the INTENTION of the promisor to be BOUND by the promise he or she made. All agreements contain some kind of a PROMISE either to do something or to refrain from doing something. ALL contracts contain promises, but NOT ALL promises become contracts. Some promises carry with them a moral obligation, but ONLY a VALID contract carries with it a LEGAL OBLIGATION. The question to be determined, then, is whether the person making the promise (the promisor) INTENDED to be BOUND by his or her promise. Some people make promises intending to be bound by them. Some people make promises with no intention of becoming legally obligated to fulfill them. Without the INTENTION TO BE BOUND, a promise CANNOT form the basis of an ENFORCEABLE contract.\n\nSince examining intention requires finding out what was in the promisor's MIND at the time the promise was made, PROVING intention can be difficult. As a result, the courts rely on a PRESUMPTION OF LAW that promisors INTEND to be BOUND BY the promises they make. Once this PRESUMPTION has been made, the ONUS, or 'BURDEN OF PROOF,' shifts to the promisor to prove that the intention did not exist. The courts look to EVIDENCE such as:\n\n1. the CONDUCT OF THE PARTIES at the time the promise was made\n\n2. the CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING the making of the promise\n\n3. the STATEMENTS MADE by the parties\n\n4. the RELATIONSHIP between the parties\n\nThe test to be applied is- \"Would a REASONABLE person hearing the promise, assume that the promisor INTENDED TO BE BOUND BY IT?\"\n\nPRESUMPTION OF LAW: an INFERENCE in favour of a particular fact; a RULE OF LAW, whereby a finding of a basic fact, gives rise to the existence of a presumed fact or state-of-affairs, UNLESS the presumption can be REBUTTED, or proven false, by the party seeking to deny the presumed fact.\n\n(Fundamentals of Contract Law, Jean Fitzgerald & Laurence Olivo, Emond Montgomery Publications) "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_540356836000253","body":"Bank of Canada.\n\nThe government's public debt (also called domestic debt or federal debt) consists largely of outstanding government securities, such as treasury bills and marketable bonds.

However, certain rules must be complied with before acceptance of an offer is valid. First, acceptance MUST be communicated by the offeree to the offeror in the manner REQUESTED by or IMPLIED in the offer. Second, the acceptance must be clear, unequivocal, and unconditional.\n\nCommunication of the Acceptance:\nthis is simple IF the offer STATES the method of acceptance. An offer might state the the offer may be accepted ONLY in writing or in person. In that case, the acceptance must be communicated in the STATED manner. HOWEVER,  the offer may NOT contain such a precise stipulation. The courts look at a number of variables to determine what may constitute a valid form of communication of an acceptance. For example, they look at the form in which the offer was made, the usual and ordinary way of doing business in a particular industry, and the HISTORY of dealings between the parties to determine whether the method of communication was valid. While the form of acceptance must generally be POSITIVE in nature; EVEN SILENCE CAN BE a valid form of acceptance if the parties have AGREED in advance that SILENCE IS SUFFICIENT, or, where the parties have HABITUALLY used this method in previous transactions.\n\nExample of SILENCE as Acceptance:\nYou belong to a music club. Each month the club mails you a NOTICE ADVISING that it will send you that moth's selection of CD's UNLESS you mail back the NOTICE stating that you dont want them. The agreement you have with the club states, that failure to send back the NOTICE constitutes ACCEPTANCE of the Cd's. In this case then, SILENCE constitutes acceptance.\n\nIF a person's conduct, though SILENT, leads the offeror to BELIEVE(?) that the offeree has accepted the offer, especially where the person receives some BENEFIT from the offeror, and knows that the offeror expects to be compensated for the services or goods supplied, the courts MAY find that a contract has been formed.\n\nExample of SILENCE as Acceptance:\nSaint John Tug Boat Co. Ltd v. Irving Refinery: the plaintiff made its tugboat available for use by the defendant. The terms of the rental of the tug were never made agreed upon in writing,  but a VERBAL agreement was made and extended TWICE. No formal authorization was made for a further EXTENSION, but the defendant CONTINUED to make use of the tug. The defendant then tried to DENY liability for ALL charges arising from the continued use of the tug. The court stated:\n\n1. Liabilities are NOT TO BE FORCED UPON PEOPLE BEHIND THEIR BACKS, any more than you can CONFER A BENEFIT UPON A MAN AGAINST HIS WILL.\n\n2. BUT...if a person KNOWS that the CONSIDERATION is being RENDERED for his BENEFIT, with an expectation that he will PAY FOR IT, then if he ACQUIESCES in its being done, taking the BENEFIT of it when done, he will be taken IMPLIEDLY to have REQUESTED ITS BEING DONE: and that will IMPORT, a PROMISE TO PAY for it.\n\nIn some cases, PERFORMANCE of the TERMS of the OFFER, may constitute acceptance. In those cases, acceptance is COMPLETE when the offeree performs all of the TERMS contained in the OFFER. In such a case, NOTIFYING the offeror of the ACCEPTANCE is UNNECESSARY.\n\nFundamentals of Contract Law - Emond Montgomery Publications by Jean Fitzgerald & Laurence Olivo "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_496522830383654","body":"The Dictionary of Canadian Law 4th-edition, DISPOSITION: 5.

Beneficiaries will have to pay Income Tax on income that the trust receives. They might also have to pay Capital Gains Tax and Inheritance Tax.\n\nOn this page:\n\n    What is a bare trust?\n    Bare trusts and Income Tax\n    Bare trusts and Capital Gains Tax\n    Bare trusts and Inheritance Tax\n\nWhat is a bare trust?\n\nA bare trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust. Bare trusts are sometimes known as 'simple trusts.'\n\nSomeone who sets up a bare trust can be certain that the assets (such as money, land or buildings) they set aside will go directly to the beneficiaries they intend. These assets are known as 'trust property'. Once the trust has been set up, the beneficiaries can’t be changed.\n\nThe assets are held in the name of a trustee - the person managing and making decisions about the trust. However, the trustee has no discretion over what income or capital to pass on to the beneficiary or beneficiaries.\n\nBare trusts are commonly used to transfer assets to minors. Trustees hold the assets on trust until the beneficiary is 18 in England and Wales, or 16 in Scotland. At this point, beneficiaries can demand that the trustees transfer the trust fund to them.\nExample\n\nGary leaves his sister Juliet some money in his will. The money is to be held in trust. Juliet is the beneficiary and is entitled to the money and any income (such as interest) it earns. She also has a right to take possession of any of the money at any time.\n\nThis is a bare trust because Juliet is absolutely entitled to both the capital (the original money put into the trust) and the income (any interest earned).\n\nBare trusts and Income Tax\n\nTrustees may receive income from investments such as bank interest, dividend income from stocks and shares or rental income from land or buildings. The beneficiary is liable for Income Tax on income received by the trust.\n\nIf you're the beneficiary and you're entitled to any income from a bare trust, you should tell your tax office. If you don’t already do so, you'll need to fill in form SA100 Self Assessment Tax Return. The beneficiary is responsible for this tax, but it may be paid for you by the trustee.\n\nGet help completing your Self Assessment tax return in our guide below.\n\nYour tax return: the basics\n\nTrusts and Income Tax\n\nContact your tax office\n\nBare trusts and Capital Gains Tax\n\nCapital Gains Tax is a tax on the gain in the value of assets such as shares, land or buildings. A trust may have to pay Capital Gains Tax if assets are sold, given away or exchanged (disposed of) and they’ve gone up in value since being put into trust. The trust will only have to pay the tax if the assets have increased in value above a certain allowance. This allowance is known as the 'annual exempt amount'. The assets of a bare trust are treated for tax purposes as if the beneficiary holds the trust assets in their own name. In a bare trust the beneficiary pays the tax as if they owned the assets directly.\n\nIf you're the beneficiary you must declare any chargeable gains on your personal Self Assessment tax return.\n\nDownload guidance notes on completing form SA108 Capital gains summary\n\nTrusts and Capital Gains Tax\n\nBare trusts and Inheritance Tax\n\nInheritance Tax is sometimes payable if the person who put an asset into the bare trust dies within seven years of doing so. This is known as a 'potentially exempt transfer'.\n\nThe beneficiary is responsible for this tax. You can find out more about Trusts and Inheritance Tax in the link below.\n\nGet more information on Trusts and Inheritance Tax\n\n HM Revenue & Customs: Bare trusts hmrc.gov.uk With bare trusts the beneficiary (the person who benefits from the trust) has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income in the trust.

The first is that he is First Nations and so the normal laws of Canada don't apply to him. Simply put the Notary Society has no jurisdiction to regulate his activities. The second is magic incantations that mean, even though he calls himself a notary, he isn't a notary as defined by the Society. Note that last line on his Notarial Signature I copied above;\n\n\"Non Domestic without Canada\"\n\nI think he is trying to indicate with that line that he holds that mystical \"International Notary\" designation that Charles Holmes was babbling about at his trial.

I made some mistakes and do not care to repeat them.\n\nFrom: http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com\n\nAgreement:\nA meeting of minds with the understanding and acceptance of reciprocal legal rights and duties as to particular actions or obligations, which the parties intend to exchange; a mutual assent to do or refrain from doing something; a contract.\n\nThe writing or document that records the meeting of the minds of the parties. An oral compact between two parties who join together for a common purpose intending to change their rights and duties.\n\nAn agreement is not always synonymous with a contract because it might lack an essential element of a contract, such as consideration.\n\nConsent:\n\nVoluntary Acquiescence to the proposal of another; the act or result of reaching an accord; a concurrence of minds; actual willingness that an act or an infringement of an interest shall occur.\n\nConsent is an act of reason and deliberation. A person who possesses and exercises sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent decision demonstrates consent by performing an act recommended by another. Consent assumes a physical power to act and a reflective, determined, and unencumbered exertion of these powers. It is an act unaffected by Fraud, duress, or sometimes even mistake when these factors are not the reason for the consent. Consent is implied in every agreement.\n\nParties who terminate litigation pursuant to a consent judgment agree to the terms of a decision that is entered into the court record subsequent to its approval by the court.\n\nIn the context of rape, submission due to apprehension or terror is not real consent. There must be a choice between resistance and acquiescence. If a woman resists to the point where additional resistance would be futile or until her resistance is forcibly overcome, submission thereafter is not consent.

It may be sent to the Executive Branch, the legislative branch, or a lower court. The famous case of Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803), which established the right of Judicial Review of congressional statutes, was an action for a writ of mandamus. William Marbury asked the court to issue the writ to Secretary of State James Madison, commanding him to deliver his judicial commission. The Court, however, refused to issue the writ of mandamus.\n\nThe writ of prohibition is another extraordinary writ and is the opposite of a writ of mandamus, because it commands a government official not to take a specified action. The most common use of the writ is by an appellate court to a lower court, commanding the lower court to refrain from a proposed action. For example, a trial court might grant a request by the news media to release information from a court file. A defendant who objects to the release could petition for a writ of prohibition from the court of appeals. If the appellate court issues the writ, the trial court may not release the information.\n\nThe writ of certiorari is an extraordinary writ issued by an appellate court that is used by that court when it has discretion on whether to hear an appeal from a lower court. If the writ is denied, the lower court decision remains unchanged. The U.S. Supreme Court has used the petition and writ of certiorari to control its caseload since 1925.\n\nThe extraordinary writ of Quo Warranto starts a proceeding in which the state challenges the legality of the use of an office, franchise, charter, or other right that can be held or used under authority of the state. For example, a writ of quo warranto would be used to remove a person who illegally holds public office, or to nullify an illegal amendment to a municipal charter.\n\nA writ of attachment is a court order used to force obedience to another order or a judgment of the court. It was originally used to order a sheriff or law enforcement officer to take a disobedient party into custody and to bring her before the court to answer for the Contempt. In modern law, a writ of attachment orders seizure of the defendant's property rather than the defendant's person to secure the satisfaction of a judgment that has not yet been secured. Modern law limits the scope and effect of attachment procedures to safeguard the defendant's rights to liberty and Due Process of Law.\n\nA writ of execution may be issued after a plaintiff wins a judgment in a civil case and is awarded damages. The writ directs the sheriff to take the property of the defendant in satisfaction of the court-imposed debt.\n\nA writ of entry is an instrument used in an action brought to recover land wrongfully withheld from the true owner or tenant entitled to possession and use of the land. It establishes who is entitled to possession of a parcel of land but does not settle the issue of who is the true owner. The central inquiry is which of the two individuals has the superior right of possession and use of the land at the time of the action.\n\nTo determine the priority of the rights of the parties fighting over land, the court must consider how and when each individual acquired ownership or possession. In general, modern laws permit the recovery of monetary damages for rent or abuse of property, as well as recovery of possession of the land. The individual who has been in possession of the land may be compensated for any improvements he has made in the property.\n\nThe writ of entry is used in only a few states to recover the possession of land. It has been replaced by the action to recover possession of real property.\n\nA writ of error is an order issued from an appellate court directed to the judge of a lower court, mandating the judge to release the trial record of an action in which the judge has entered a final judgment. The appellate court issues the writ so that it may review the case and either reverse, correct, or affirm the lower-court decision. Most states have replaced the writ of error with a simpler appellate document, usually called the notice of appeal.

So, you may have noticed that i speak about objection and standing. There is a reason for that. Lets have a recap on some things before we get into the liening.\n\nWhat would be the account?\n\nWe know how the PROVINCE OF ONTARIO is operated by JUSTICE. This makes or means that the court system as you used to know by is in fact commercial. What does that mean? Well it means that they are a business.

If lets say you have a restraining order. Courts make money off that. When you lien it. They no longer make money. So you can see why they would be encouraged to terminate it.\n\nSo what happens after?\n\nWhen you lien it and perfected it, you therefor control everything in that case. You direct how your case goes.\n\nSo now that you got a basic grasp what now?\n\nWhen you perfect it no one will oppose it(how can they?They are not persons.)If they did not oppose it then they have no standing to speak or direct. See where I'm going? That is why your objections will become infinitely more powerful because you will truly have the only party with standing.\n\nAnyways, I'm sure this covers the basic concepts and benefits of what you can do.

The NAME was charged with some criminal stuff, after a fight with his girlfriend's NAME, and a TRIAL has been set for, lets say April 1st.\nLet's imagine this is in the STATE OF FLORIDA. The MAN is out on BOND. The NAME has now fired his \"PUBLIC DEFENDANT\". The MAN has filed the NAME/BC/SURETY BOND into the court file, getting the NAME in the CUSTODY of the court. The MAN has sent the judge, and prosecutor, via registered mail, a NOTICE OF MISTAKE, along with copy of the VOID order, and copy of the BC. He has not filed the NOTICE OF MISTAKE into the court file, hoping this can be resolved in the PRIVATE. The PROSECUTOR got the REGISTERED MAIL NOTICE, and the judge, soon, will as well. TRIAL is set for april 1st.\nIf You would imagine being in the shoes of this MAN, what steps would be required to make sure this matter is SETTLED and CLOSED, given all the facts so far?

Such a system could conceivably make it impossible for the ISP to respond to privacy-infringing requests, even when compelled by big media conglomerates, public officials or authorities.\r\n\r\nThe legal viability of an all-encrypted ISP appears to hinge on a provision in a 1994 federal law called CALEA. The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ensures that ISPs are not held responsible for decrypting data if they don't have the necessary information to do so. If Merrill has his way, Calyx won't have a clue what's going on under the hood of its service. This means the ISP should be able to operate squarely under this premise.\r\n\r\nAfter running his own ISP in New York, Merrill picked up a thing or two about the need for privacy in today's post-9/11 climate. In 2004, he enlisted the help of the ACLU to legally fight a request by the FBI to divulge customer details without a court order. To make this situation particularly menacing, the FBI required Merrill to never publicly disclose the request or the existence of the letter. After a lengthy six-year legal scuffle and having to remain anonymous throughout the course of the trial, Merrill won the case and a federal judge struck down a portion of the Patriot Act which made it illegal to defy an FBI gag order. United States District Judge Victor Marrero described the provision as an \"unconstitutional prior restraint of speech in violation of the First Amendment.\"\r\n\r\nAfter dealing with the FBI and the U.S. legal system for six years, the entrepreneur was inspired to design an ISP where privacy is integrated into its virtual DNA. As a result, Merrill has created the Calyx Institute and woven together an advisory board with the likes of former NSA technical director Brian Snow and TOR project leader Jacob Applebaum. \r\n\r\nMerrill will be meeting up with potential West-coast investors in the next couple weeks as he attempts to raise $2 million before the service launches.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.techspot.com/news/48141-non-profit-isp-start-up-promises-fully-encrypted-private-internet.html "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_494044817298122","body":"Just got kicked out from court du quebec....they dont want to deal with joseph pierre gilles......they want to deal with PIERRE DAOUST....

They were and still are Colonies of the Crown Temple, through letters patent and charters, WHO HAVE NO LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BE INDEPENDENT FROM THE RULE AND ORDER OF THE CROWN TEMPLE. A LEGAL STATE IS A CROWN TEMPLE COLONY.”\n\n“Neither the American people nor the Queen of Britain own America. THE CROWN TEMPLE OWNS AMERICA THROUGH THE DECEPTION of those who have sworn their allegiance by oath to the Middle Temple Bar. The Crown Bankers and their Middle Templar Attorneys rule America through unlawful contracts, unlawful Taxes, and contract documents of false equity through debt deceit, all strictly enforced by their completely unlawful, but ’legal’, orders, rules and codes of the Crown Temple Courts, or so called ‘Judiciary’ in America. THIS IS BECAUSE THE CROWN TEMPLE HOLDS THE LAND TITLES AND ESTATE DEEDS TO ALL OF NORTH AMERICA.”\n\nSeven Middle Inn Templars who had pledged an oath of allegiance to the Crown Temple (including Alexander Hamilton) were among the members of the Constitutional Convention who signed the completed ‘American Constitution’.

The law of trusts developed to deal with this situation.\n\na TRUST, is the result of a CONTRACT in which property is TRANSFERRED from one person to another for the BENEFIT of a THIRD-PARTY. The law of trusts allows the person who is to RECEIVE the benefit of a contract, the BENEFICIARY, to enforce the contract against the person who is to ADMINISTER the property for his or her benefit, the TRUSTEE. A trust that is DECLARED in clear and unequivocal terms, usually in writing, is called an EXPRESS TRUST.\n\nEXPRESS TRUST - a trust that arises as a result of an agreement, usually in writing, that is created in EXPRESS terms.\n\nEXAMPLE: Tony wants to create a trust for Scott, in case Tony passes away before Scott turns 18 years of age. In Tony's will, he directs that all of his estate is to be invested for the benefit of Scott until he is 18 years old, and Tony names his sister Cari-Lee as the TRUSTEE. After Tony passes away, the property is transferred to Cari-Lee. However, instead of ADMINISTERING the trust for the benefit of Scott, Cari-Lee spends the money on herself. Scott is NOT a party to the trust agreement - Tony and Cari-Lee are the only parties. However, the law of trusts allows Scott to enforce the agreement because he is the BENEFICIARY of the trust.\n\nTRUSTEE - a person who holds property in trust for, or for the benefit of, another person\n\nIn other cases, the parties to a contract may create a benefit for a third-party without expressly calling it a trust or without using language in the contract that would allow the third-party to enforce the contract. In those cases, the third-party MUST argue that a trust was created by inference or implication. The courts will examine the terms of the contract and the acts of the parties to determine whether the true intent of the contract was to create a trust. This can be a difficult argument to make because the courts are reluctant to impose a trust unless there is clear evidence that the parties intended to create one. When the courts find that a trust can be inferred from the contract, it is called a CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST. The beneficiary of a constructive trust may ENFORCE the terms of the trust.\n\nCONSTRUCTIVE TRUST - a trust created by the OPERATION-of-LAW, as distinguished from an express trust.\n\nEXAMPLE: Dean and Tony form a PARTNERSHIP. The partnership agreement states that if Tony should pass away, then Tony's share of the profits of the partnership should be paid to his wife, Cari-Lee. Tony passes away, and Dean refuses to pay the profits to Tony's wife, Cari-Lee. Cari-Lee is not a party to the partnership agreement. The partnership agreement did not set up an EXPRESS trust. Cari-Lee would have to argue that it is a CONSTRUCTIVE trust that had been created in her favour. If successful, Cari-Lee would be able to obtain a share of the profits.\n\nPARTNERSHIP: 1. a contractual relationship, an agreement, between two or among more persons to run a BUSINESS together in order to make a PROFIT (\"Doing-Business-As\"). Only persons who INTEND to, or by their conduct can be seen to have INTENDED to, can become partners.\n2. \"...there should be some COMMON profit or gain to be derived from it (why Winston Shrout is always saying when he walks into court- \"Wheres my cheque...?\") Whether or not the element of division or distribution of the common PROFIT or GAIN among the members is an essential, need NOT BE DISCUSSED; but, there must be...a COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS in the BENEFITS accruing from the joint activity of the partners. If that community of interest is lacking, there is NO partnership...\" Ottawa Lumbermen's Credit Bureau v. Swan, 1923. The Dictionary of Canadian Law, 3rd-edition.\n\nQUASI PARTNERSHIP: \"...analogy with partnership...is convenient but certainly not legally determinative of the outcome...It expresses the reality of situations where shareholders in a company are not mere investors but are participants in its business and rightfully expect that they will continue to play a part in the management of its affairs.\" Mason v. Intercity Properties Ltd., 1987. The Dictionary of Canadian Law, 3rd-edition.\n\nCOMMUNITY OF INTEREST: 1. participation in a joint venture characterized by shared liability and shared OPPORTUNITY for PROFIT. See JOINT VENTURE. Black's Law, 9th.\n\nJOINT VENTURE: a business undertaking by two or more persons engaged in a single defined project. The necessary elements are: (1) an EXPRESS or IMPLIED agreement; (2) a COMMON purpose that the group INTENDS to carry out; (3) SHARED profits and losses; and (4) each member's EQUAL VOICE in controlling the project. - also termed joint adventure; joint enterprise.\n\"There is some difficulty in determining when the legal relationship of joint venture exists, with authorities disagreeing as to the essential elements...The joint venture is not as much of an entity as it is a PARTNERSHIP.\" Laws of Corporations, 1983.\n\nJOINT-VENTURE CORPORATION: a corporation that has joined with one or more INDIVIDUALS, or corporations, to accomplish some specified project.\n\nQUASI-CORPORATION: an entity that exercises some of the functions of a corporation but that has not been granted corporate status by statute (City of Toronto?); especially a public corporation with LIMITED authority and powers (such as a county or school district). - also sometimes termed QUASI-MUNICIPAL CORPORATION.

So they are SUMMARILY 'executing' what they claim are DEBT INSTRUMENTS against you. The problem is, the debt instruments dont exist and are not REAL because there is no DEBT. But we are not addressing this issue. We are going and pleading 'Guilty' or 'Not Guilty'...you can shut then \"THE CROWN,\" DOWN, in a SECOND, by asking them to clarify who they ARE. Because as soon as you clarify that its NOT 'Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth of the House of Windsor,' NOW its a corporation and they can ONLY enforce contracts against you. Now you ask for THE CONTRACT. No CONTRACT, no OBLIGATION. This is all based upon an IMPLIED contract that they CANNOT produce. And if they DID produce it? They would admit to the FRAUD that is being carried-out. Then they would admit, for example, that the Drivers' Licence is CONTRACTUAL in nature. If you dont have one then they cant CHARGE you. Because, then it would be clear that this is all based on CONSENT. So now when you get a ticket or a CHARGE against you, you contact THE CROWN and you say- \"Excuse me, i need to clarify exactly who YOU are. Are you representing Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth of the House of Windsor, or, are you representing HER MAJESTY IN RIGHT OF ENGLAND, which i believe to be a CROWN CORPORATION of the independant-nation of the inner-City of London, England? If that is the case, then i am sorry but i dont have a contract with you i believe you are mistaken. If you're claiming that there IS a contract in place, please produce it within the next 10 business days, otherwise we have NO further business together. Now, when they dont reply, you inform the courts of that. So, what are they going to say to that? They didnt reply, so you win by default-FUCK yeah, this corporation, THE CROWN CORPORATION known as HER MAJESTY IN RIGHT OF ENGLAND, has AGREED with me that we DONT have a contract. So they have NO jurisdiction to prosecute. So now your problem isnt with the COURTS, its with this entity called THE CROWN that you BELIEVED was an agent of Her Majesty The Queen, Elizabeth of the House of Windsor. If you look at ANY statute thats passed...does it EVER say, enacted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth of the House of Windsor? Fuck NO, it does not. Because thats not who it is. HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ENGLAND...they are a number of sub-corporations of THE corporation which is the inner-city of London, which is the COMMERCIAL centre of the PLANET for their criminal enterprise. HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ENGLAND, IS THE CORPORATION OF LONDON, that is the name they go by...the sovereign-independent-nation of London.\" Dean Clifford & Ben Lowrey The Crown & The Court System 17th Aug 2011 youtube.com http://www.deanclifford.info "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_516177175084886","body":"FW: PRO-SE WINNERS is a NEW BLOG TALK RADIO SHOW AT 1 - (347) 215-9477 or  http://www.blogtalkradio.com/pro-se-winners - EVERY FRIDAY & SATURDAY EVENING at 6:00 PM on PACIFIC STANDARD TIME or 9:00 PM EASTERN STANDARD TIME!  - LEARN ABOUT YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO TRAVEL!!!!  -- WE ARE REAL PATRIOTS & CONSTITUTIONALIST’S WHO ALL DRIVE WITHOUT DRIVERS LICENSES AND BEAT ALL OF OUR TICKETS!!!!

THIS TOP PART IS INFORMATION ON THE TWO CROWNS,hope link works ....\n\nTHE TEMPLARS OF THE CROWN\n\nThe governmental and judicial systems within the United States of America, at both federal and local state levels, is owned by the \"CROWN,\" which is a private foreign power. Before jumping to conclusions about the QUEEN OF ENGLAND OR THE ROYAL FAMILIES OF BRITAIN owning the U.S.A., this is a different \"Crown\" and is fully exposed and explained below. We are specifically referencing the established TEMPLAR CHURCH, KNOWN FOR CENTURIES BY THE WORLD AS THE \"CROWN.\" From this point on, we will also refer to the Crown as the Crown Temple or Crown Templar, all three being synonymous.\n\nFirst, a little historical background. The Temple Church was built by the Knights Templar in two parts: the Round and the Chancel. The Round Church was consecrated in 1185 and modeled after the circular Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The Chancel was built in 1240. The Temple Church serves both the Inner and Middle Temples (see below) and is located between Fleet Street and Victoria Embankment at the Thames River. Its grounds also house the Crown Offices at Crown Office Row. This Temple \"Church\" is outside any canonical jurisdiction. The Master of the Temple is appointed and takes his place by sealed (non-public) patent, without induction or institution.\n\nAll licensed Bar Attorneys - Attorners (see definitions below) - in the U.S. owe their allegiance and give their solemn oath in pledge to the Crown Temple, realizing this or not. This is simply due to the fact that all Bar Associations throughout the world are signatories and franchises to the international Bar Association located at the Inns of Court at Crown Temple, which are physically located at Chancery Lane behind Fleet Street in London. Although they vehemently deny it, all Bar Associations in the U.S., such as the American Bar Association, the Florida Bar, or California Bar Association, are franchises to the Crown.\n\nhttp://nesara.insights2.org/CrownTemplars.html\n\nULTIMATE HEIR ACT\n\nChapter U-1\n\nHER MAJESTY, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, enacts as follows:\n\nDefinition\n\n1   In this Act, “ultimate heir” means the person entitled to take by descent or distribution the property of whatsoever nature of an intestate in the event of failure of heirs or next of kin entitled to take that property by the law in force before July 1, 1929.\n\nRSA 1980 cU-1 s1\n\nThe ultimate heir\n\n2   The Crown in right of Alberta is the ultimate heir\n\na)    of any person dying intestate in fact with regard to any property situated in Alberta, and\n\nb)    of any person domiciled in Alberta and dying intestate with regard to any movable property or chose in action wherever situated.\n\nRSA 1980 cU-1 s2\n\n“Heir”, etc. to include Crown\n\n3   The words “heir”, “heirs”, or “next of kin” in any document transferring land situated in Alberta, or giving or evidencing title  to land, are to be construed by all courts and judges in Alberta as including the Crown in right of Alberta, but only after all other heirs or next of kin.\n\nhttp://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/stat/rsa-2000-c-u-1/latest/rsa-2000-c-u-1.html The Crown Temple nesara.insights2.org The Crown Temple: By rule of mystery Babylon; the difference between the Queen of England and the Crown "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_511383842230886","body":"So i appeared today in court and when the judge asked me if i was DEAN KORY i answered that i was the bennificiary to the trust being called by the court....he issued a warrant for the arrest of DEAN KORY for fail to appear!

They are well established, some having been founded in the early 1200's.\n\nThe Queen and Queen Mother of England are current members of both the Inner Temple and Middle Temple.\n\nGray's Inn specializes in Taxation legalities by Rule and Code for the Crown. Lincoln's Inn received its name from the Third Earl of Lincoln (circa 1300).\n\nJust like all U.S. based franchise Bar Associations, none of the Four Inns of the Temple are incorporated - for a definite and purposeful reason: You can't make claim against a non-entity and a non-being. They are private societies without charters or statutes, and their so-called constitutions are based solely on custom and self-regulation. In other words, they exist as secret societies without a public \"front door\" unless you're a private member called to their Bar.\n\nWhile the Inner Temple holds the legal system franchise by license to steal from Canada and Great Britain, it is the Middle Temple that has legal license to steal from America. This comes about directly via their Bar Association franchises to the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple through the Crown Temple.\n\nFrom THE HISTORY OF THE INN, Later Centuries, [p.6], written by the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, we can see a direct tie to the Bar Association franchises and its Crown signatories in America:\n\n\"Call to the Bar or keeping terms in one of the four Inns a pre-requisite to Call at King's Inns until late in the 19th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, students came from the American colonies and from many of the West Indian islands. The Inn's records would lead one to suppose that for a time there was hardly a young gentleman in Charleston who had not studied here. Five of the signatories to the Declaration of Independence were Middle Templars, and notwithstanding it and its consequences, Americans continued to come here until the War of 1812\".\n\nAll Bar Association licensed Attorneys must keep the terms of their oath to the Crown Temple in order to be accepted or \"called to Bar\" at any of the King's Inns. Their oath, pledge, and terms of allegiance are made to the Crown Temple.\n\nIt's a real eye opener to know that the Middle Inn of the Crown Temple has publicly acknowledged there were at least five Templar Bar Attornies, under solemn oath only to the Crown, who signed what was alleged to be an American Declaration of Independence. This simply means that both parties to the Declaration agreement were of the same origin, the Crown Temple. In case you don't understand the importance of this, there is no international agreement or treaty that will ever be honored, or will ever have lawful effect, when the same party signs as both the first and second parties.

Meads, 2012 ABQB 571 download pdf here) concerning an acrimonious divorce in Edmonton, Canada has confirmed the inherent danger to the sustainable future of society of so called “Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Arguments” or “OPCA” proffered by acolytes and advocates of the more sophisticated and complex “Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture” to which such arguments by definition must belong.\n \nWhile the formal 736 paragraph “Reasons for Decision” by Associate Chief Justice J.D. Rooke (\"Justice Rooke\") is full of presumptions, suppositions, inaccuracies and gross fallacies, the document nonetheless may herald a milestone in identifying a new way in which debate and discussion concerning jurisdiction, law and procedure may unfold – specifically the admission that certain “OPCA” structures exist masquerading as legitimate argument and law, yet having no validity except by force, or as Justice Rooke states in a quote from Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan “The laws are of no power to protect them, without a sword in the hands of a man, or men, to cause those laws to be put in execution.”\n \nExperience and expertise at researching OPCA\n \n[1] For the past 26 years and increasingly full-time over the past fifteen years, it has been my passion and calling to research, discover and objectively reveal the full extent of the complex “Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture” established firstly by the Roman Cult, also known as the Vatican from the 11th Century in claiming the role of Vicar of Christ from the Frankish-Saxon Catholic Church and later fully developed under Henry VIII in the form of “Commonwealth law” through Westminster from the 16th Century; and\n \n[2] Both forms of law still pervade the world today. Both forms of law through Papal Bulls and Acts or \"Statutes\" are based on obvious frauds and outrageously false presumptions such as the Bull Unum Sanctum (1302) which claims “all creatures are subject to the Pontiff” and the Statute of Westminster (1275) which incredibly refers to several 17th and 18th Century legal terms designed to abrogate the rights of people such as “waste”. Most importantly, both systems of pseudo-legal and pseudo-lawful argument are an anathema to the history of prior Western Law such as Carolingian (Anglo-Saxon) Law, Byzantine Law and even Roman Law which recognized the inherent and fundamental importance of consent; and\n \n[3] As Justice Rooke mentions Frank O’Collins in paragraph (376) as an “OPCA Guru”, while conceding Ucadia and One-Heaven represents a “new and total code of law”, it is a matter of principle that a measured response is published, particularly in answer to a large number of gross errors and emotionally and intellectually unstable and unsupportable references throughout the judicial opinion; and\n \n[4] The following prescription is provided to some of these fallacious and vexatious opinions by a wholly biased and unsuited justice in his treatment of a subject for which he appears overwhelmingly not to be an expert. \n \nVexatious Litigation and Mala Fide (Bad Faith)\n \n[5] Justice, similar to commerce, depends upon two or more parties engaging with one another to resolve a matter with mutual understanding known in “good faith”. The opposite concept to “Good Faith” is bad faith or mala fide. Blacks 9th Edition (Pg 159) defines “Bad Faith” or mala fide as “dishonesty of belief or purpose”; and\n \n[6] The history of legal maxims, statute and case law concerning mala fide is well defined and clear – that a party acting with dishonest intent, or misrepresenting the facts commits an injury against the law itself – hence the most ancient Roman maxim ex dolo malo non oritur actio meaning “an action does not arise from fraud”; and\n \n[7] Similarly, “Vexatious Litigation”, also known as a “Vexatious Suit” is correctly seen as an injury against the law itself with Blacks 9th Edition (Pg 1701) defines a “Vexatious Suit” as “A lawsuit instituted frivolously, or maliciously and without good grounds, meant to create trouble and expense for the party being sued”; and\n \n[8] However, unlike the identification of fraudulent and wrongful action male fide (bad faith), the question of what does or does not constitute “Vexatious Litigation” is so conditional upon each specific circumstance that (to date) attempts to enforce stricter rules, codes or restrictions against perceived “Vexatious Litigants” have inevitably failed under appeal. It would be an arrogant judge indeed to ignore the weight of history and presume that what he or she may present as “Vexatious Suit” in one circumstance renders any form of partial or similar behavior equally vexatious in the future; and\n \n[9] As to the specific evidence presented in the rambling 736 paragraph reasoning or Treatise (\"Treatise\") of Justice Rooke concerning the alleged “vexatious” behaviour of one party, including evidence of male fide: a competent forum of appeal or competent jurist upon review would have to reasonably conclude that whatever “Vexatious Suit” and bad faith was demonstrated by one party in the proceeding, the action of Justice Rooke in exceeding his authority, mandate and objectivity to scribe his document outweighs any wrong doing by either litigant and renders a far greater injury against the law; and\n \nSpurious, Irrelevant or Invalid documents and formalities\n \n[10] Suspending for the moment the underlying theme of unquestionable jurisdiction presumed by Justice Rooke to make the wide ranging array of presumptions, errors and simplistic logical fallacies littered throughout his Treatise, it is necessary to consider the merits of specific points raised concerning the use by parties of allegedly spurious, irrelevant or invalid documents and formalities; and\n \n[11] Whereas in past generations, a party to a court matter may be forgiven for the mistake of using an incorrect form or procedure, the age of the Internet affords the vast majority of the populace with virtually instant access to most standard forms and their instructions for most types of courts, especially in Western countries. In many cases, even the same judicial procedures expected to be followed by court officials is also available for instant download and review; and\n \n[12] Whether or not a court is properly constituted or merely a corporate franchise masquerading as a valid court is irrelevant to the fact at hand that a competent party choosing to proceed with a matter within a certain court operated by one of the network of secretive Temple and Bar Guilds is able to not only find the proper forms accepted by the court, but also the generally accepted guidelines of such a commercial pseudo-legal entity; and\n \n[13] An employee of such a pseudo-legal entity, whether a properly invested justice, or merely a private contractor under a letter of marque, has every right to disqualify documents that do not comport the internal procedures of such an entity. Justice Rooke is correct that litigants that ignore this fact risk rendering any argument fatally flawed in the face of demonstrative incompetence in the manner of how they conduct themselves through their paperwork; and\n \n[14] Justice Rooke is also correct in nominating a virtual cottage industry of people “selling” and promoting their own versions of “remedy” to sometimes desperate and gullible people, especially in being convinced that absurd and idiotic corruption of grammar and punctuation somehow renders a superior position as in the case of one highly discredited “remedy guru”. Similarly, there are many other people promoting their own versions of documents through seminars and web sites with the promise of instant success; and\n \n[15] As to the validity of the content contained within such documents, Justice Rooke has gravely erred and is in gross error in seeking to comment and adjudicate the merits of the content. It should have been enough for any Justice to summarize that such documents tendered to the court as per the exhibits within the Treatise do not confirm to proper procedure, were spurious and irrelevant and therefore put to rest. For Justice Rooke then assumed the position of historian, theologian and philosopher and proceeded to adjudicate the validity of the content is quite extraordinary and now demands clear debate and honest answers to a number of the topics raised.\n \nCestui Que Vie Trusts and Annuities\n \n[16] In several places within his Treatise, Justice Rooke seeks to ridicule those who may question the existence of a type of trust in their name called a \"Cestui Que Vie\" Trust and its intimate connection to the Birth Certificate; and\n \n[17] While refusing to admit to the existence of such a trust in the name of the litigant in the case, a reasonable person could be led to conclude by the words of Justice Rooke that such claims of the existence of a Cestui Que Vie Trust in the name of each citizen of Canada as in other Commonwealth and western countries is mere mythology and evidence of mental illness; and\n \n[18] In fact, the existence of Cestui Que Vie Trusts and their fundamental importance to the present global accounting system of Western-Roman States is without question. The Cestui Que Vie Act of 1666 and of 1707 remain largely in force even today. The reason for these acts? To create the legal fiction necessary that declares if a person is considered lost at sea, abandoned, dead, a lunatic, a minor or incompetent then not only may their property be held in guardianship, but that a contract may be established called an \"annuity\" whereby a value may be granted to the guardian or custodian by the purchaser of the contract in exchange for some form of ongoing income derived from maximising the value of the estate of the infant, lunatic, lost or \"dead\" person. The result is the birth of annuities through such acts of parliament as Life Annuities in 1703 which helped fund the ongoing wars of Great Britain and subsequent acts such as the 28 million pounds from annuities act of 1801 which created an even larger annuity system; and\n \n[19] The existence of annuities created against the name of citizens of Western-Roman States, particularly former or present Commonwealth countries is unquestionable. One of the first key acts of US Congress was to establish a system for the repayment of public debt through the selling of shares and annuities through the 1790 Public Debt Act. Virtually every country has its own annuity public statutes, such as Canada and these can be found by searching the public databases. In each and every case, annuities depend upon the existence of Cestui Que Vie Trusts. So who is said to administer Cestui Que Vie Trusts in most Commonwealth countries? The Queen's Bench of the High Court!; and\n \n[20] Here we find that either Justice Rooke is attempting to pervert the course of justice in deliberately obfuscating the fact that he does possess a genuine fiduciary duty to administer the very trust to which the litigant refers, but for some unknown explanation is unwilling or unable to do so; or Justice Rooke and the entire Queen's Bench is wholly incompetent and such fiduciary obligations are no longer being met. In either case, the Treatise of Justice Rooke has opened up more questions than it has answered; and\n \n[21] Fiat justitia ruat caelum (let justice be done though the heavens fall) is not merely one of the oldest and most important maxims for all Judges and Magistrates, it is expected by the public that a judge render his or her verdict and reasoning impartially and without supposition as to whether an accused found guilty is a “good or evil man or woman” in the eyes of the Universe. Any judge that willingly and deliberately exceeds such maxim does so at peril to Justice in that realm and on the face of the Treatise of Justice Rooke, it appears strongly that fair justice is indeed under threat in Canada; and\n \nThe illegitimacy of using Fallacy to define argument\n \n[22] The most forbidden act for a Judge or Magistrate to use when addressing the law, is the use of “fallacy”, sometimes also written as “logical fallacy”. This is because for more than two thousand three hundred years (since the time of Plato and Aristotle) it remains a steadfast truth of any competent forum that when one or more fallacies are found to exist in any legal argument, especially one associated with a verdict then logically the whole argument itself may be discredited, derogated or abrogated; and\n \n[23] A classic example of how arguments based on fallacy are forbidden in legitimate and valid forums of justice (as opposed to pseudo-legal commercial places masquerading as courts) is a false argument such as a classic non-sequitur (a) “A red haired man killed a policeman” therefore (b) “All red haired men are killers” or (c ) “Red haired men only kill police”. To a man or woman of sound mind and reason, such an argument is obviously flawed and untrue and injurious to the law; and\n \n[24] A separate example of logical fallacy is “argumentum ad hominem” whereby an argument is constructed upon false and untested presumptions of character in order to validate an argument. It is why competent judicial systems normally forbid their Judges and officials from making or writing argumentum ad hominem fallacies concerning the mind of an accused until such facts are properly tested and can be rightly deduced; and\n \n[25] It is with great regret that the government and judiciary of Canada have permitted the release a document evidencing not one, or two specific paragraphs demonstrating non-sequiturs and ad hominems, but literally dozen upon dozen paragraphs filled with formal and logical fallacies of such number that it is impossible at this time to reference them all within the brief of this reply. This might be something a competent and reasonable reader of the Treatise of Justice Rooke may choose to do at their leisure; and\n \n[26] On every possible grounds of judicial competence, the treatise of Justice Rooke should be immediately withdrawn. Certainly, if the Inner and Middle Temple themselves were disinclined to act against such an obvious injury to the credibility of any future judgments emanating from the Queens Bench in Canada, then one could reasonably conclude the rot within the legal profession is terminal.\n \nThe invalidity of circular arguments as logical proof\n \n[27] A further example of fallacy (logical fallacy) littering the Treatise of Justice Rooke is the fallacy of circular thinking, also known as circular logic. Because of how prevalent this particular logical fallacy exists within the treatise of Justice Rooke, the demonstration of such incompetent reasoning requires particular mention; and\n \n[28] A classic example of logical fallacy that all readers would be familiar is “because I said so”, as a time honored answer offered frequently by parents and teachers when cornered on a challenge of jurisdiction, order, instruction of explanation. Continuing the analogy, such a fallacy of circular thinking is usually backed up if challenged by some demonstration of enforcement of jurisdiction. As evidenced by the quote of Hobbes mentioned by Justice Rooke in the opening of his treatise, it appears a similar flawed thinking exists; and\n \n[29] “Might is right” may have been argued by President Lincoln, but it is inarguable as Rule of Law. Before the study of Lord Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England was eventually abandoned to less rigorous education of young legal minds, most first year graduates of law school much less a senior Judge should know that authority of law is ultimately derived from consent of the people. Anything else is merely a decree without legitimacy; and\n \n[30] In a just system, there exists no separate form of law for judges versus litigants. A man who is asked to give consent to testifying under oath in a presumed court of law has every right to ask as a matter of principle that all those who shall administer such an oath and speak for or against such testimony are equally enrolled and bound. The several circular fallacies referenced by Justice Rooke to this point are manifestly inadequate and an example of either extraordinary contempt for fundamental principles of law, or an attempt to obfuscate some other factors contributing to the result that in practice a judge does operate under separate form of law; and\n \n[31] A similar array of flawed and inadequate circular fallacies were offered up by Justice Rooke as to the question of jurisdiction and authority of a court, especially by what form(s) of law it may or may not function. Such questions when done as a matter of respect are absolutely fundamental to the fairness of law. To dismiss such points through the use of circular arguments akin to “because I said so” is an open mockery to the rights of fair hearing, justice and to be heard for any litigant or party before any court in Canada, the United States, Australia and any other jurisdiction enjoyned to the Treatise of Justice Rooke. \n \nThe Danger of Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Arguments\n \n[32] Justice Rooke of Canada is indeed correct on one point: “Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Arguments” and those that propagate them are a danger to Justice, the law and civilization in general. As we have just outlined clearly and methodically, we are indeed dealing with an extremely dangerous, spurious, illegitimate instrument in the matter of the Treatise of Justice Rooke himself that threatens the very Rule of Law and Justice in Canada and potentially wider if further propagated; and\n \n[33] The Canons of Law also known as Astrum Iuris Divini Canonum defined through the Society of One Heaven as mentioned by Justice Rooke in paragraph (376) define Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture under Article 163 of Canons of Sovereign Law being:\n \nCanon 6652\n \nOrganized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture (OPCA) is a universally recognized description and acronym to define a comprehensive commercial system of law, statutes, offices, administration, history, enforcement based on fraud, false presumptions and repudiation of time honored principles of Divine Law, Natural Law, Positive Law and Rule of Law. The first “OPCA” Architecture ever invented was the Commonwealth Law Form from the time of Henry VIII of England in the 16th Century CE.\n \nCanon 6653\n \nIt is universally accepted by all competent jurists and philosophers that a system must contain the following elements to be validly defined as a Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture (OPCA) being an Area, Army, Assembly and Administration of one or more Agencies\n \n(i) An Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Area, also known as a “country” or “nation” is the appearance of a valid kingdom or constituted dominion under some instrument of constitution, when it is in fact merely a franchise of a larger pseudo-religious commercial network such as the Roman Cult having no legitimacy whatsoever; and\n \n(ii) An Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Army, also known as a “police force” or “sheriff force” is a body appearing to maintain law and order which is instead used to enforce the narrow policies of commercial self interest of a few controlling the OPCA architecture; and\n \n(iii) An Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Assembly, also known as a “parliament” is a body possessing the appearances of validity consent, in the issuing of acts, but which repudiates and rejects the need for consent of the people instead treating with contempt its own laws in order to maintain commercial advantage and power at any cost; and\n \n(iv) An Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Administration and Agencies such as the Private Bar Guilds pretending to be legitimate courts when such franchises are frequently mere registered corporations run by Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Acolytes masquerading as justices and officials.\n \nCanon 6654\n \nThe Traits of OPCA Architecture have been rooted in the indicium (signs) of legitimacy since the 16th Century, while promoting rituals and administrative procedures that have no basis in law or history other than to profor commercial advantage to the Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Acolytes. These fraudulent signs are highest in use within the private courts operated for profit by the Private Bar Guilds mostly since the 19th Century falsely pretending to respect and protect the law and uphold the ancient maxims of law in accordance with these Canons, including but not limited to:\n \n(i) The adoption of robes and dress that have more association with wizardry, occult worship of Ba’al as Galli attendants than any legitimate mandate of jurisprudence; and\n \n(ii)The adoption of language, the use of upper and lower case to denote corporate fictions and estates from trusts and other associated elements; and\n \n(iii) The use of terms stolen from sacred law such as “session”, “honorable” while judges in many jurisdictions no longer take proper oaths, nor feel compelled to do so, or justify such behaviour; and\n \n(iv) The heavy use of nautical and maritime terms in association with admiralty law, yet with no interest in honoring the limited remedy made available through such corrupt law.\n \nCanon 6655\n \nAn Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Acolyte, also known is one thoroughly immersed and satisfied with the architecture of Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture who displays the general characteristics of arrogance, contempt for history and rule of law, a blasphemous rejection of the significance of Divine Law and is willing to defend the system to the end, without any desire to comprehend its provenance or function. The strongest exemplars of such cultish and fanatical behaviour remains the deliberately corrupted academic system of Western nations from the 20th Century and the insular courts systems of Western nations operated by the Private Bar Guilds.\n \nCanon 6656\n \nThe misrepresentation, misnaming or misconstruing of the term Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture (OPCA) is an indication of deliberate fraud, ignorance, incompetence or a combination of all these factors.\n \nCanon 6657\n \nAny argument claiming the present canons reflect in any way a Organized Pseudo-Lawful Commercial Architecture (OPCA) is hereby false, a repudiation of all form of logic and sense and therefore an open confession that the proponent of such a claim is suffering severe mental illness and unfit to hold any form of office.\n \nConclusion\n \nClearly, there exists an existential threat to Justice and the Rule of Law in Canada, the United States and Australia and it is from rogue Judges and Magistrates who now openly seek to declare war against sections of the population and to ignore basic principles of judicial competency.\n \nThe question is whether we will see a reprieve or a continuation of the rapid decline of basic competence in all fundamental branches of government? Time will tell. "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_502616459774291","body":"In an earlier thread I mentioned something about using stamps on legal documents.\nThis is a synopsis as to why:\n\nThe UPU, Universal Postal Union, in Berne, Switzerland, is an extremely significant organization in today’s world. It is formulated by treaty. No nation can be recognized as a nation without being in international admiralty in order to have a forum common to all nations for engaging in commerce and resolving disputes. That is why the USA under the Articles of Confederation could not be recognized as a country. Every state (colony) was sovereign, with its own common law, which foreclosed other countries from interacting with the USA as a nation in international commerce. Today, international admiralty is the private jurisdiction of the IMF,et al., the creditor in the bankruptcy of essentially every government on Earth.\n\nThe UPU operates under the authority of treaties with every country in the world. It is, as it were, the overlord or overseer over the common interaction of all countries in international commerce. Every nation has a postal system, and also has reciprocal banking and commercial relationships, whereby all are within and under the UPU. The UPU is the number one military (international admiralty is also military) contract mover on the planet. For this reason one should send all important legal and commercial documents through the post office rather than private carriers, which are firewalls. We want direct access to the authority—and corresponding availability of remedy and recourse—of the UPU.\n\nFor instance, if you post through the US Post Office and the US Postmaster does not provide you with the remedy you request within twenty-one (21) days, you can take the matter to the UPU. Involving the authority of the UPU is automatically invoked by the use of postage stamps.Utilization of stamps includes putting stamps on any documents (for clout purposes, not mailing) we wish to introduce into the system. As long as you use a stamp (of any kind) you are in the game. If you have time, resources, and the luxury of dealing with something well before expiration of a given time frame, you can use stamps that you consider ideal. The most preferable stamps are ones that are both large and contain the most colors. In an emergency situation, or simply if economy is a consideration, any stamp will do.\n\n Using a postage stamp and your autograph on it makes you the postmaster for that contract. Whenever you put a stamp on a document, inscribe your full name over the stamp at an angle. The color ink you use for this is a function of what color will show up best against the colors in the stamp. Ideal colors for doing this are purple (royalty),  blue (origin of the bond, the one holding the contract), and gold (king’s edict). Avoid red at all cost. Obviously, if you have a dark, multi-colored stamp you do not want to use purple or blue ink, since yourautograph on it would not stand out as well if you used lighter color ink. Ideally one could decide  on the best color for his autograph and then obtain stamps that best suit one’s criteria and taste.\n\nAlthough a dollar stamp is best, it is a luxury unless one is well off financially. Otherwise, reserve the use of dollar stamps for crucial instruments, such as travel documents. The rationale for using two-cent stamps is that in the 19th Century the official postage rate for the de jure Post Office of the United States of America was fixed at two (2) cents. Remember the old expression “add your two cents worth”. This denomination should be ideal in most situations. Use stamps on important documents, such as a check, travel documents, paperwork you put in court, etc. Where to put the stamp and how many stamps to use depend on the document. On foundational documents and checks, for instance, put a stamp on the right hand corner of the instrument, both on the front and on the back. The bottom right hand corner of the face of a check, note, or bill of exchange signifies the liability. Furthermore, the bottom right hand corner of the reverse of the document is the final position on the page, so no one can endorse anything (using a restricted endorsement or otherwise) after that. You want to have the last word. If you have only one stamp, put it where you are expected to sign and autograph over it cross-wise. In the case of a traffic ticket, for instance, put a stamp on the lower right hand corner where you are supposed to sign and autograph across the stamp at an angle from upper left to lower right.

In Indiana today, what could that possibly mean? The message from the ruling class is quite clear, and utterly insane. It amounts to this: “We don’t have the right to invade your home without probable cause … but if we DO, you have no right to stop us, and we have the right to arrest you if you try.”\n\nWhy not apply that to the rest of the Bill of Rights, while we’re at it? ”You have the right to say what you want, but if we use violence to shut you up, you have to let us.” (I can personally attest to the fact that that is the attitude of the U.S. “Department of Justice.”) “You have the right to have guns, but if we try to forcibly and illegally disarm you, and you resist, we have the right to kill you.” (Ask Randy Weaver and the Branch Davidians about that one.) “You have the right to not testify against yourself, but when we coerce you into confessing (and call it a ’plea agreement’), you can’t do a thing about it.” What good is a ”right”–what does the term “right” even mean–if you have an obligation to allow jackboots to violate your so-called “rights”? It makes the term absolutely meaningless.\n\nTo be blunt, if you have the right to do “A,” it means that if someone tries to STOP you from doing “A”–even if he has a badge and a politician’s scribble (“law”) on his side–you have the right to use whatever amount of force is necessary to resist that person. That’s what it means to have an unalienable right. If you have the unalienable right to speak your mind (a la the First Amendment), then you have the right to KILL “government” agents who try to shut you up. If you have the unalienable right to be armed, then you have the right to KILL ”government” agents who try to disarm you. If you have the right to not be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures, then you have the right to KILL “government” agents who try to inflict those on you.\n\nThose who are proud to be “law-abiding” don’t like to hear this, and don’t like to think about this, but what’s the alternative? If you do NOT have the right to forcibly resist injustice–even if the injustice is called ”law”–that logically implies that you have an obligation to allow ”government” agents to do absolutely anything they want to you, your home, your family, and so on. Really, there are only two choices: you are a slave, the property of the politicians, without any rights at all, or you have the right to violently resist “government” attempts to oppress you. There can be no other option.

It was very easy to do (“so easy, a caveman can do it”).  We know the matrix is full of adhesion contracts.  I heard various ideas on how to skirt the system which required forever covering the VIN (never do this); but none included actual removal from the matrix, no one knew how.  I didn’t want to skirt it – I wanted totally out.  [EDIT: What I mean by removal is cancelation of the contract and not receiving any further offers to contract.] A close friend already had a US DOT number plate, and covered the VIN.  So I did some research, which I love to do. [US DOT = United States Department of Transportation (federal)]\n\n \n\nFirst, I obtained a US DOT number and had a plate made, which says at the bottom “Not for Hire”; it is not “registrant only” because I did not know about the US DOT number until after “registrant only” was phased out for new applicants.\n\n \n\nSecond, when I received the corporate Notice of Registration Renewal (offer to re-up the contract) I returned the corporate state’s property (license plates) to the DMV by priority mail flat rate envelope to its headquarters in Sacramento – not the local branch.  I mailed the plates along with an Actual and Constructive Notice letter, the renewal notice with “cancelled” written diagonally across the face and the last registration certificate to a living natural person in charge of registration operations.  I located the DMV directory containing this information.  The \"Reader's Digest\" version of my letter: I specifically detailed the DMV codes relating to registration and the various related definitions from the code along with the one that says in the event of a federal definition, the federal trumps the state.  Then I buried the coffin with the federal definitions.  I told them in light of the fraud, the DMV was directed to update their records to reflect that my VIN refers to a private car that was not involved in commerce and therefore not a type required to be registered.  Also the addressee would be held personally liable if I suffered damages at the hands of “revenue officers” due to non-compliance with my instructions.  I signed it “All Rights Reserved, 1-308” above the signature. \n\n \n\nI keep a copy of the letter and evidence of mailing in my car glove box.  Haven’t received any response (not that I expected to) and it has been several months.  The DMV here sends out [late] notices [and penalty fees] when you are delinquent with registration.  It’s that easy once you know own what you know.  I’ve helped two friends (including the one with the DOT plate) do the same.  This information is hidden in plain view; you just have to know it’s there.  He who does not know his rights has none.  I cannot recall where I found bits and pieces of the puzzle posted online that contributed to my education on the how, but I am forever thankful and grateful to those kindred spirits.  I hope this helps those who may be searching for a way out.  [I researched using what is freely posted on the net as a guide and composed my response. Your state may vary . Check out famguardian.org, sedm.org, 1215.org, state-citizen.org, freeinhabitant.info, smileyjharris.blogspot.com, and search the Sovereign Warriors forum; these are just a few of the resources where you can find information. ] "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_579565578746045","body":"Traffic Ticket Bill of Exchange No.1\n\nJanuary the 10th, 2013, while I was administrating a steering wheel, and a gaz pedal, and a brake pedal, for the person I happen to have in my pocket, which is named PIERRE DAOUST, a private contractor stopped me, he has a gun on him :(\n\nSo I asked him if I was OBLIGE to give him the person’s name, he said YES. So since he had a gun, and I don’t, I gave him the name of the person I happen to have in my pocket.\n\nThe fuck up in all this is that “me”, as a Man, I don’t get to be recognize in ALL this shit, these guys are looking for PERSONS……so hey, I have one :)\nSo he proceed with the preparation of a Bill of Exchange for PIERRE DAOUST, yes traffic tickets ARE bill of exchange.\n\nI took it, since I am the SOLE authorized administrator for PIERRE DAOUST, and brought it in my office. After verifying all this, I could not find any CONTRACT hooked between PIERRE DAOUST, and the city of montreal. \n\nSo I sent back this BoE written NO CONTRACT on it.\n\nBeginning of July 2013, I received a NOTICE from the city of Montreal, with a Bill of Exchange of $295.00 :D\n\nOn that NOTICE, it says that PIERRE DAOUST has been found GUILTY of something, and PIERRE DAOUST has been JUDGE for something :/ .\n\nSo I simply discharged that debt for PIERRE DAOUST, and sent a request to City of Montreal with 2 simple questions, for my OWN curiosity.\n\nPlease send me the NAME, ADDRESS and inscription number of the PERSON who decided to enter a plea for PIERRE DAOUST, and the NAME, ADDRESS and inscription number of the PERSON who judge PIERRE DAOUST…..nothing fancy, just 2 simple questions.\n\nThey’ve replied that I had to CALL them to have answer on these questions, and that if I don’t call them, They will not follow up with this matter.\n\nSo I called :D …..and of course, record that call, the lady named LISE who spoke with me on the phone, was trying to scares me with ALL that would happen if I don’t PAY the tickets, I stopped her several time during the conversation and ask her to LISTEN to me….so I had to raise my voice a bit……and I told her to FOCUS on the 2 questions, I told her that I don’t give a shit about ANYTHING else…..\n\nShe finally answered :D ….and confirmed that a computer system entered a plea on PIERRE DAOUST, and a computer system JUDGE PIERRE DAOUST. I said THANK YOU and hung up :D\n\nSo I have wrote a nice NOTICE, you guys knows how good of an ADMINISTRATOR I am :D saying that the BoE was discharged, unless they can prove otherwise, the Bank of Canada accept it, unless they can prove otherwise, There was no DEFECT on the instrument, unless they can prove otherwise, The city of Montreal did not REFUSED the administration process so far, unless they can prove otherwise.\n\nAnd PIERRE DAOUST has been judge by a computer system, and a plea has been entered for PIERRE DAOUST by a computer system, I can email the audio recording to you for your file :D\n\nI gave them 10 days to REFUSE the administration process used concerning that BoE, and an affidavit to prove ANY of the points above.\n\nSo, 10 days after, I received a very small letter from them CONFIRMING the Name of the “Justice” who pleaded for PIERRE DAOUST, and judged PIERRE DAOUST. :D\nThat’s it that’s all……\n\nMy thinking is that THEY just could NOT leave that computer system thing open, they were fucked with this….and that was October the 8th, 2013.\nI have NOT received anything regarding a refusal concerning the administration process used to discharged that debt. Maybe Scott can say something about this ?\n\nI will come back with Traffic Ticket Bill of Exchange No.2 Shortly, which is very interesting as well :D\n\nAgain…..my INTENTS are to get the TRUTH from these PUBLIC SERVANTS, if I amd a SLAVE, I need to know, and want the chains that goes with the title, I want these chains via REGISTERED mail :P\n\nThanks\nPete "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_582734325095837","body":"Scott Duncan Rod class says the 18 USC Codes aren't in Effect, yer thoughts please!\n\n Posts about Rod Class on Alternativeaction Blog alternativeaction.wordpress.com Posts about Rod Class written by cadmar1944 "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_582815585087711","body":"...and you all just let it happen.

The bill sent from the Senate, for the temporary establishment\nof the Post Office, was read the second and third time, and passed.    The bill \nfor establishing the Judicial Courts  . . . , for establishing the seat of government\nOther references to the Post Office support my theory of the founding\nforefather’s views:\nPOST OFFICE. A place where letters are received to be sent to the persons to whom\nthey are addressed. \n2. The post office establishment of the United States, is of the greatest importance\nto the people and to the government. The constitution of the United States has invested\ncongress with power to establish post offices and post roads. Art. 1, s. 8, n. 7.\n3. By virtue of this constitutional authority, congress passed several laws anterior\nto the third day of March 1825, when an act, entitled \"An act to reduce into\none the several acts establishing and regulating the post office department,\"\nwas passed. 3 Story, U. S. 1825. It is thereby enacted, 1. That there be established,\nthe seat of the government of the United States, a general post office, under the\ndirection of a postmaster general.  [259]\n We need to take notice where the commas are placed on that last sentence.  That\nthere be established, the seat of the government of the United States, a general\npost office, under the direction of a postmaster general. When I set off a clause\nwith commas, I make sure that the sentence makes sense without that clause.  Taking\nout the set-off clause, we read, . . . the seat of the government of the United\nStates under the direction of a postmaster general.\n The creation of the Post office occurs before the creation of the seat of the government, and is placed in authority over the seat of government.  What is the effect of these\nlegal techniques?  The stated position of an object and the sequence of events play an important role in the Universal Legal Technology.  The effect is that the Government’s later bankruptcies in 1859 and 1929 have no legal effect upon the solvent Post Office.\nWe can make a case that the formation of the Post Office before the formation of\nthe government’s operations is a stroke of dumb luck.  Perhaps it is ingenious,\nsince communication has a higher value than government itself.  If any government\nfails, the people still have a need to communicate with one another to form a new\ngovernment. And to this day, the Post Office is still solvent and operational, ready\nto fulfill its duty to help the people in their communications; to set a new government\nshould a complete break down of the existing governmental structures occur in the\nUnited States.  Sounds like a very good back up plan. \n The formation of the Universal Postal Union in 1874 has another legal effect that\nis very important to the Universal-Legal-Technology.  The Universal Postal Union\nunites member countries into a single, worldwide postal territory.  We have\nalready learned that any litigant is going into international jurisdiction every\ntime he goes to any court.  Since the litigant needs to establish that his papers\nare official, he uses a dollar postage stamp on the face of the first page.  The\nstamps also invoke postal statutes and the Universal Postal Union jurisdiction. \nCurrently in the U. S., the stamp of choice is the fox U. S. dollar postage\nstamp.  The stamp is not drawn in a box, making the forty-five-degree lines unnecessary.\nThe litigant does, however, need to autograph across the stamp, then date the autograph,\nfor two reasons: to comply with postal regulations concerning private mail carriers,\nand to make a continuance of evidence that the process (paper work) is mail.  The\ncontinuation of evidence is less of a factor, since the definitions of mail\nand delivery can include a clerk at a grocery store handing a customer a receipt\nfor groceries.  \n( Heres's my question!!!! Are we/I missing something, as far as the SEAT of Gov,as mentioned?? Help me understand this, Can the PO, be used as a court??) Read the Part about where the comma's are placed!

We left the house on her e bike, she had a helmet on I did not. We came to our first intersection to poster and I noticed the pigs in the turn lane, as we crossed the street the Clown entities pulled to the curb lane and the female entity informed me that I was breaking the law by not wearing a helmet, I laughed and stated that I am an adult and quite capable of making my own decisions. I then asked if I was free to go. \n\nThe sow answered no and asked if she could see my ID to which I stated, for what purpose? Do you intend on causing me harm. At this point the rather large cannibal in uniform ( I could smell bacon on his breath) and the sow exited the cruiser with obvious intent to extort a name via threat, coercion or intimidation. He claimed to have witnessed me cross the walk with pedestrians riding the e bike and me not wearing a helmet is a violation of the hwy trafficking act and that I had to produce identification. \n\nI asked the clown entity what law states I had to produce government issued id as I was not carrying any and that I had no problem giving them my name. The sow then asked for my name to which I stated David. She then asked for a surname to which I stated I could not give that which did not belong to me, I could give the given but not that which belongs to my family. The sow stated that she needed my name and that I would be placed under arrest and so I orated the family name. She then asked my dob and i asked by who's authority do you ask for private information. \n\nThe cannibal, standing in silent rage instantly lost his contenace and shit on me and my rights with his violent nature and ego, he grabed me with force, twisted my arms around back and placed me in bondage telling me I was under arrest and that I was going to the station for finger printing. He was very hostile and bound my left wrist so tightly that I felt a nerve being pinched. I knew this was to throw me off my standing and place in mental duress but I remembered to state I do not consent to any searches before ordering him to loosen the left cuff. \n\nAs a matter course he squeezed the cuff tighter and stated that I had no choice I was under arrest. His cloven hand dived right into my pockets. I stated loud and clear that I did not consent to any violation of my rights that he was causing me harm and was to loosen the left cuff. \n\nThe sow stated they needed to identify me while bacon breath worked me into a frenzy of pain by twisting the binding while lifting me into the air , at this point I began shouting that they were peace officers and that they were causing me harm. \n\nAt this point I began making more mistakes by shouting at them and not retaining my calm, I was in pain and my first concern was the damage being caused. I lost focus and started calling them little more than animals, brutish criminals enacting violence for consent.\n\nI told the cannibal I was no longer corresponding till the binding was loosened. The piece of stinking shit pretended to loosen the binding while causing me to shout out in pain. He claimed I was resisting. He then opened the cruiser door, pushed a button on the side of the cage, informed me I was being recorded and placed me inside.\n\nThey turned to speak to my partner but she's super smart, she left the keys to her e bike and helmet and stood in the shadows across the street.\n\nThe pigs looked confused, they knew they lost track of more information.\nWhen they oinked their way into the bacon mobile the first question was where did my friend go. I replied that I will choose what questions I answer.\n\nNext question was do I have a drivers licence? Same reply\n\nI'm a little fuzzy on what the exact order of questioning was. I will get the video and post it here.\n\nI think I asked wether they were peace officers and if their intention was to collect a tribute for HER MAJESTY. The sow replied with. \" have you ever had mental health issues. Standard answers was I will choose what questions I will answer.\n\nAt this point the cannibal drew her attention to the computer and she asked if my address was bla bla bla. Standard answer. Again they looked perplexed. My license came up with no picture and no criminal history of which there is plenty (many years ago). They talked about how little info was in there system and then the sow asked if I had a criminal history. I replied with a firm yes. Seemed to me the dipshit swine were even more perplexed. \n\nThe claim now was they would release me with a fine if I provided them with an address they could confirm. The address on the licence is a private sanctuary so just to fuck with them I gave them my P.O box so they could not correspond the two together.\n\nKnowing the camera was on I ranted for a little while about peace officers playing policy enforcer, how peace officers have a duty to not cause harm in the community and how shooter Forcillo was enacting the policy of shoot center mass when his duty was to section 7 and 10(c) of the charter. \n\nThe dipshit swine then began to have second thoughts when I asked for a business card and the information of the their underwriter and bond holder. Both claimed not to be carrying business card and played clueless to public hazard bonding. I asked if they thought they could operate with impunity, if they actually believed they held no liability in the community. \n\nDead silent.\n\nThe sow asked me for my angels #, she claimed that if I could get her to come back to identify my name they would release me. I noticed 2 bicycle cops showed up and I thought to negotiate by telling the sow the bike cop could call her and give her the options. To my surprise they agreed on camera that the bike cop would phone and tell her she was in no trouble and that the purpose was only to identify the name. I gave the sow her digits and she gave the deets to the bike cop to call. He did and my angel agreed to return on condition. \n\nWhen she arrived, the cannibal exited the bacon mobile and asked her what my name is. Her first statement was that she is not involved in their or my affairs. The cannibal stated that they just need to confirm my name and address. My angel stated she did not understand the question and she did not want to be involved. The pig said he just wanted to corroborate my name and asked if I was David. She said yes I was david he then asked my last name and she said she was not involved. He asked if my surname started with a V. She said yes, he then asked if my last name was Vbla bla. And she stated yes.\n\nThe cannibal informed the sow that my angel corroborated my name and that I could be released from my bondage with a ticket. The dipshit pigs released me from the bacon mobile and offered me the ticket, I took the ticket and told the sow I was going to correct the controversy by seeking her public information being the bond, business card and underwriter information. \n\nI will be going to 55 division today to demand from the desk Sargent the information I need to correct the controversy.

Our American silver dollars are actually heavier, since other metals were added for durability. But that 371.25 grains of silver WAS the dollar, matching in weight an unbroken chain of accepted monetary units that reached back through the Spanish Milled Dollar, the Dutch Daller, back to the German Thaler; the product of a silver mine which sold its product in coins of an exact weight. The Coinage Act of 1792 defined our dollar to exactly match in weight the silver dollars in use around the world, and then defined the gold dollar to be that amount of gold which would equal the worth of silver in a silver dollar, 24.75 grains, 1/15 the weight of the silver in a silver dollar.

The Universal Postal Union unites member countries into a single, worldwide postal territory. 13[13] We have already learned that any litigant is going into international jurisdiction every time he goes to any court. Since the litigant needs to establish that his papers are official, he uses a dollar???? postage stamp on the face of the first page. The stamps also invoke postal statutes and the Universal Postal Union jurisdiction. Currently in the U. S., the stamp of choice is the “fox” (discontinued 22 April 2004 or earlier) U. S. dollar postage stamp. The stamp is not drawn in a box, making the forty-five-degree lines unnecessary. The litigant does, however, need to autograph across the stamp, then date the autograph, for two reasons: to comply with postal regulations concerning private mail carriers, and to make a continuance of evidence that the process (paper work) is mail. The continuation of evidence is less of a factor, since the definitions of “mail” and “delivery” can include a clerk at a grocery store handing a customer a receipt for groceries. One can see that Standaring had his shipping clerk wired with the Bill of Lading. \n\nThe legal writers were forced to make the definitions wide enough to encompass the private rural carriers, and private advertisers that have placed advertisements on our doorsteps, or in our hands. I have thought about this issue a lot, and I did not find any other better alternative. Any loophole would have devastated many consumers, and caused a plethora of other laws to be enacted to cover the loophole. \n\nAdditionally, on the back of the first page, we authenticate the authority of the Post-Office with an endorsement, and simultaneously authenticate our identity by placing a postage meter stamp, from a postage meter machine that we have purchased in advance, on the lower quarter of the back of the first page. All commercial papers have endorsements to authenticate their authenticity. Again, we autograph across the meter stamp, and date. The postage meter stamp is better than a regular stamp, and stamps are said to have rendered seals superfluous. 14[14] The purchase of a meter machine requires identification in case the meter machine is tampered with or is stolen. The meter number on the meter stamp can be traced back to the owner (litigant), and therefore authenticates the endorser better than any seal. \n  Scott Duncan-Is this what makes the \"Buck-O-5\" Method so powerful????

Waterford with a summons to the Circuit court in Waterford City. When the tenant opened the door she was greeted by a large thuggish man with handcuffs hanging off his belt, who pushed straight past her and moved through the house, checking the rooms demanding to know where I was. I was not there as I live up the country now and have for a while. Just to point out from the start of this story, I have a case in the High court since last November, a valid case that the bank does not have a claim over the property for many reasons, including: they sold on the original loan agreement with my signature as a financial instrument through a process known as securitisation, they are in breach of contract law by their actions, they are insolvent as a business and it is illegal to trade while insolvent, they have no banking license and other claims. Also, and one of the most important, they were at no loss of accounting as they never loaned me any cash in the first place, my signature created the credit. \n\nBack to the story; this thug acting for Ulster bank had no lawful authority to enter the premises and he was not invited, all he had the power to do was issue a summons. He had no order for repossession. THIS IS TRESPASS, a common law crime. He did not leave his name or any contact details. Two Gardai were with him, watched him enter the property and did not interfere when he unlawfully entered the property. He threatened the tenant with eviction. His actual words were \"You will be out of here by xmas\". There is a young child living in the property with his mother. He was screaming with distress. This man threatened to take all property in the near future regardless if it was mine or the tenants. He also said and I quote \"You don't have to give this summons to him if you don't want to\". The reason why he would say that is because he said he knows I have a case in the high court against Ulster bank, if I , or others like me win, it will open the flood gates. They are trying to get a repossession order in the lower court to stop my case before it is heard. WE ARE HAVING AN IMPACT! They are now panicking and sending heavies in to try and intimidate people who are bringing lawful claims against the corrupt banks into the court. \n\nTo say I am shocked and upset by the blatant breaking of the law of the land while members of An Garda Siochana stand idly by, is an understatement. I was lawfully and civilly dealing with this through the courts, while Ulster Bank have now lowered themselves to sending in scum and scaring the life out of women and children without even a court order in hand. I will use all means necessary to find out who this criminal was who without lawful authority entered my home and seek a criminal prosecution against him for trespass. If we have no law, we have nothing in society. THIS HAS TO STOP NOW!\nJames.

So, time for some research, i know there has to be cases that demonstrate silence as agreement, oh wait, isnt the Supreme Court filing, Notice to Admit one of those ? If you dont reply in 14days, your in agreement, geez i think these are are half retarded, therefore untrust worthy 100%, they only seem to apply these sort things when it favors their players, as to why you dont go into their damn PRIVATE COURTS, unless by force, or by you standing on your contract, either way it can be fun if you know what you doing, here is the posting\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nSure enough, Petrie has claimed that Black’s Law Dictionary contains a definition of “tacit consent”. Justice Ker notes that the current version does not, but perhaps he meant “implied consent”, which is defined (para. 46). The response is, in my mind, worth quoting in full:\n\n[47] That definition is of no assistance to the applicant. The basis of contractual obligations is an agreement between the parties, often referred to as consensus ad idem or agreement of the parties to the same thing. However, the jurisprudence or common law does not support the applicant's argument.\n\n[48] In Resource Realty Ltd. v. Swiftsure Developments Ltd., 2005 BCSC 229 (CanLII), 2005 BCSC 229, Mr. Justice Owen-Flood held the following at paragraphs 23 and 24:\n\n[23] Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff's offer was accepted through the defendant's silence. Mr. Braithwaite communicated his terms to the defendants orally and in various faxed documents. Because there is no concrete evidence that the defendants specifically rejected these offers, the plaintiff submits that their silence constituted acceptance. However, as held by the Supreme Court of Canada in Schiller v. Fisher, 1981 CanLII 49 (SCC), [1981] 1 S.C.R. 593, acceptance must be communicated to the offeror before a contract can be found to exist:\n\n[g]enerally, the fact of acceptance of an offer must be communicated to the offeror before acceptance is complete and a binding contract is created.\n[24] As stated by Professor Waddams in The Law of Contracts, Fourth Edition (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 1999) at p. 67,\n\nOrdinarily, therefore, silence will not operate as an acceptance even through the offeree should prove an intention to accept. This is not a technicality but part of the requirement of a bargain. No reasonable person, on receiving a proposal that looks for a reply, considers the bargain concluded until the manifestation of assent. Nor will a reasonable offeror ordinarily consider that silence on the part of the offeree manifests the latter's acceptance (references omitted).

Read on.\nAntonio Paulo\n9 hours ago via mobile \n\nHe He He He He He:) That was so much fun. I absolutely kicked the shit out the judge, the prosecutor, the clerk + the Victoria Police. The judge + prosecutor now have to offset the debt that they created by charging the 'Cestui Que Vie Trust.' They are up for a substantial amount of money between them both. It only took me 3 minutes to completely destroy the court system. They had to get me out of there + quick smart. I was exposing the fraud of the court + I did it all from the 'Public Gallery' without even stepping a foot into the dock/court. The judge calls out \"Antonio Paulo.\" I answered back by saying \"Are you saying that the trust which you are now administering is the Antonio Paulo trust sir?!\" He was stunned + turned white. Judge then answers. \"May you please step into the court please?\" I answered. \"Sorry. I reserve my right to stay here in the public gallery.\" The judge - \"You are required to come into the court.\" Me - \"Sorry. I do not consent to boarding the ship or coming into the 'Bar' sir.\" The judge - \"We'll proceed anyway.\" The prosecutor - \"Antonio Paulo failed to obey our parking signs.\" I cut him off + said. \"Antonio Paulo is indeed in the court.\" I pointed at the judge. \"It is you! As 'Trustee/Administrator. You are Antonio Paulo today aren't you?!\" The judge + prosecutor both drop their heads. I continue in addressing the court. \"Before we go any further. I need to know who you all are?\" I point to the clerk + say. \"Are you the 'Cestui Que Vie's 'Owner/Trustee' who has appointed this judge as 'Administrator' + 'Trustee' of the constructive trust case no. D12403742. Did you also appoint the 'Prosecutor' as 'Executor' of this constructive trust?\" I then point to the judge + say. \"So you are the 'Trustee.' Then pointed to the 'Prosecutor' + said. \"And you are the 'Executor' + I am the 'Beneficiary.' So now we know who's who and as the 'Beneficiary.' I authorize you to handle the accounting + dissolve this constructive trust.\" The judge, prosecutor + the court is in dead silence. I continue in saying. \"I now claim my body. So I am collapsing the 'Cestui Que Vie Trust' which you have charged as there is no value in it. You have committed fraud against all laws! Are you not the creators of controversy?!\" The judge with a face that is red as a tomato calls for the Police + security to remove me from the court cause I exposed their fraud. In the meantime I ask the judge 3 times. \"Are you under oath here today sir?\" No answer from the judge. I then ask him \"Are you are a public servant?\" No answer. I then ask him 3 times. \"Excuse me. May I see your 'Writ Of Commission' + 'Bonding Agreement sir?\" The judge could not produce it for me at all. I then state. \"I as a sovereign am now the highest authority in the court as the judge has not shown me their 'Writ Of Commission' + 'Bonding Agreement.' I now dismiss the case!\" By that time the police + security remove me from the court as I have now exposed the judge + the fraud of the court. I was released at the front door with me saying to the police. \"Go back into your private corporate courtroom + continue to commit 'Treason' you fake counterfeit police impersonators.\" Now the court is left to pay the debt that they created. Stiff shit to all the people that thought that I was talking shit + was going to get locked up. I won the case!

Please dont go off topic, stick to the topic at hand please. i will delete any comments try to steer this off course.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat s. 32 actually does is makes it a requirement for Canadian law, and government actors to follow and respect the rights provided to Canadian residents under the Charter. The court at paras. 74-84 explains how Petrie has literally got the law backwards in a simply excellent analysis on this point:\n\n    [75] Section 32 of the Charter and the jurisprudence interpreting this section makes it clear that the Charter applies to all actions undertaken by state authorities and government agents when they interact with private citizens, meaning that private citizens who have an interaction with a government actor benefit from the rights afforded to them by the Charter during that interaction and have recourse to the courts if they believe that the government actor, and by extension the government, has breached one or more of their Charter rights. To give a concrete example: state conduct, i.e. government action, such as police investigating and arresting a private citizen must conform with Charter values and respect the Charter rights of the private citizen. Thus an individual private citizen, when investigated by the police, has the right to be secure from an unreasonable search and seizure by virtue of s. 8 of the Charter and has the right to retain counsel upon arrest or detention by virtue of s. 10(b) of the Charter.\n\n    [76] The jurisprudence interpreting s. 32 of the Charter also establishes that the Charter does not apply or govern activities between private citizens or between private citizens and corporations. Thus, where a legal dispute arises between private citizens, for example, in a divorce proceeding or interpreting the terms of a contract, the parties cannot invoke their respective Charter rights against one another.\n\n    …\n\n    [79] With respect, the applicant appears to be endeavouring to turn the jurisprudence pertaining to s. 32 of the Charter on its head. If he is arguing that because he is a private citizen the Constitution, and by extension the laws of this country, only apply to government actions and agents, he is mistaken. He, too, is subject to the laws of Canada, including the CDSA. He cannot pick and choose what laws apply to him, nor can he engage in what Myers J. characterized in Porisky at para. 67 as \"legal numerology\" by picking and choosing extracts from statutes and cases and weaving them together in an attempt to create logical links where none exist.\n\n    [80] Section 32 of the Charter mandates that the Charter applies to government actions such as the RCMP's investigation and arrest of the applicant in this case, which means that the applicant's Charter rights are to be observed and protected in the carrying out of such actions. The Charter does not, however, govern interactions between private citizens. Moreover, s. 32 of the Charter does not stand for the notion that as a private citizen the Constitution and the laws of Canada do not apply to the applicant and his actions.\n\n    [81] If the applicant is trying to assert the Court has no jurisdiction over him to try the offences because, by virtue of s. 32 of the Charter, the Constitution and the laws under which he is charged only applies to government agents, and he is not a government agent, he has fundamentally misconceived what s. 32 of the Charter means and what the jurisprudence has interpreted its purpose to be.\n\n    [82] If the applicant is trying to advance the argument that the laws under which he is charged do not apply to him because he is not a government agent, again he is mistaken.\n\n    [83] If the applicant is suggesting the Court has no jurisdiction over him to try the offences because he is a private citizen and thus outside of the Court’s jurisdiction, then, as Mr. Justice Hollinrake noted in R. v. Warman, 2001 BCCA 510 (CanLII), 2001 BCCA 510 at para. 13 [Warman], his argument would be \"a complete denial of the constitutional history of this country as it applies to the rights and obligations of its people before the law.\" Arguments of this kind must be and are \"rejected as being without any legal, historical or constitutional foundation whatsoever\": Warman, at para. 14.\n\n    [84] There is no legal merit in the point the applicant advances under s. 32 of the Charter "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_558349907534279","body":"So I have the RIGHT to this person named PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX is life?....so I guess I can kill it ?\n\nI also have the RIGHT to this person named PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX is Liberty?.....So I guess I can cage it ?\n\nAnd I also have the RIGHT to this person named PIERRE DAOUST 26X-XXX-XXX is SURETY/SECURITY? :D ......so I guess I can LIEN it ? :D\n\nLarf, larf, larf, larf…..fap, fap, fap, fap\nCheck Mate :D\n\nI feel like I have a SLAVE in my pocket :D\n\nSigned\nThe-Master-of-PIERRE-DAOUST-26X-XXX-XXX "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_558232847545985","body":"My understanding is that the UK is debating a private members bill \"Provide a system of national service for young persons; and for connected purposes.\" \n\nIn the above description they use the word PERSONS, but in the description they use the words \"participant\" and \"individual\"\n\nindividual, adj.

Forgive me if I seem to ramble.\n\nIn response to a request to Scott Duncan, wherein he was solicited to propose  suggestions/solutions/remedies to the difficulty faced by those wanting to TRAVEL in their PRIVATE, NOT FOR HIRE property, without being accosted by men with guns, and, or having their property seized, Scott suggested that we do not drive ourselves. \n\nFor me, and, judging by the posts of others, the answer seemed to be an obvious reference to a common theme here at TFL, specifically the (generalized) “mantra”: do not expect justice from the courts (government agents etc.) as it is tantamount to appealing to your rapist to treat you fairly. \n\nERGO (at least in MY MIND): Don’t steer yourself around in that technology. If, however, you choose/desire to do so in the capacity of a man/woman, and should you suffer a TORT while lawfully traveling in your private property, do not expect to be provided a remedy, and, certainly do not expect any justice. Bottom line…don’t own a car and attempt to use it by yourself if wish to be somewhat protected from the harm that such use can bring you. \n\nOn a personal note, and possibly for other members, this was, and is, “a very hard pill to swallow”. \n\nAnyways, after weeks of considering/contemplating the implications of the above, I sat down with my son this morning and we watched the documentary “HOT COFFEE”. (I recommend it -  for whatever that’s worth.)\n\nThe film examines the extensive efforts by corporations and such to limit the ability of men and woman to receive compensation and, or justice to TORTS which they may incur. A fortified and revitalized global effort to deny us justice, was seen by the filmmakers largely as a response to (amongst other suits) the litigation brought forward by the old woman who spilled coffee on herself and subsequently successfully sued McDonalds.\n\nWhile watching this documentary, Scott’s advice regarding the use of a car (as described above) kept returning to my mind. I began to wonder (MOVIE SPOILER ALERT), since almost every useful technology and service available to us today is provided to us with one or all of the following: \n\na) a MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT which waives our right to seek justice from any other source other than your rapist, and, or, you must first agree to never inform the public of any harm you become aware of which is caused by that company/service etc. \n\nb) INDEMNIFICATION of the company/service from our government (think drugs and vaccines for example) in which the government has passed acts and statutes protecting drug companies from any damages they would otherwise be responsible for (even if they know/knew their products were/are harmful, toxic, poisonous, cancer causing etc.)\n\nc) TORT LIMITS, which more often than not put the burden of costs related to recovery, treatment etc. are without recourse foisted upon the victim, and, or, the public; \n\nNow, it seems, there are dozens of tough pills for me swallow. SHOULD WE, AS CONSCIENTIOUS MEN AND WOMAN, wishing to avoid harm to ourselves and others, USE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES when, by their very use, we are quite likely AGREEING to be COMPLICIT in any and all unscrupulous acts perpetrated by the companies/services/organizations, and, additionally, are likely agreeing to be bound by a provision to never bring any such devious treatment of customers/clients/users - to the attention of the public?\n\nIt has just dawned on me, after watching the movie, that following the logic of the car example above, and, given the even more extreme ramifications of a), b), and c) mentioned above concerning other technologies etc. ;  perhaps we would be best protected from harm to ourselves and others by not engage in commerce to secure our ability as men and women to use telephones, cell phones, internet, health insurance, medical care/treatment, etc. \n\nHow can we, if at all, protect ourselves, should we desire to use other products/technologies/services/organizations etc. which come with clauses such as those described above?\n\nAm I way off track and over thinking this? Questions and comments are encouraged as always. Thanks. :) "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_557038387665431","body":"What are you thoughts on this ?\n[526] It occurs to me that ‘fee schedules’ may also have a potential criminal effect. Documents of this kind are intended to impede the legitimate action of government, law enforcement, and court actors by purporting to assign very sizable penalties for actions that are not only a part of their jobs, but very often a duty. These penalties are a threat of “damage to property”. Since ‘fee schedules’ have no legal force, the threats they contain are by definition unlawful.\n\n[527] If so, it seems that perhaps when a person advances a ‘fee schedule’, that may be prima facie evidence of the act and intention of the Criminal Code, ss. 423.1, intimidation of a justice system participant offence.

You see, I.C.B.C. applied a debt (not belonging to me) on my credit report and I have been trying to have removed for more than two years. Of course, this directly effects my rating and subsequently my credit.\n\nI really don’t understand why it is me who has to work this out for them seeing it wasn’t me who created the debt, nor was I the one who is unable to correctly manage the account, nor was I the one who accept the file or attach it to my bureau report. It seems as though I am the only one with the desire to remove it. One would think they would want to track down the correct person to recoup their debt.\n\nThe Phlip I first spoke to spoke english barely and was either deliberately difficult or he was just stupid. Raymond-8991 told me he was in Canada though he was not a Canadian citizen. I requested to speak with a supervisor but he refused to escalate the call. He would not give me the name of the supervisor nor would he do anything to correct the reason for my call. He ended up hanging up on me because I asked him if he knew of a law which requires Canadian companies servicing Canadians to supply calls, if requested, to be directed to a Canadian on Canadian soil.\n\nI called back (again) and spoke with a female who answered my questions to only inform me that they were a call center in the Philippines and they were not Canadian citizens. I tried to make a complaint about Raymond however she refused to take it and directed me to call this number, the one above. She would not release the name of the business she worked for. I asked to speak to a supervisor but again, she refused.\n\nSorry for the semantics but I am a little aggravated at the moment. I am so pissed and need this gone. Sure would be nice to recoup something for my time and inconvenience as well.\n\nI am new to this and will take a wild stab and say I need 2 affidavits to inform them of the circumstances and a fee schedule to bill for future time and inconveniences if required. Send one to ICBC and another to Equifax. Of course, I have absolutely no idea how to do this and humbly request the wisdom of TENDER FOR LAW.

In Latin it is written as 'ab original', which simply means 'from the original' and not inferior as most believe; same with the word 'abnormal'. 'Ab normal' means 'from the normal' and not necessarily meaning inferior.\n\nHere in Australia, the word(s) 'Aborigine/Aboriginal' is a created proper noun; however, aborigine is a co-joined from the Latin, 'ab origine', the Etymology of which is from Latin ab (“from”) + origine, ablative singular of origo (“earliest beginning, lineage, origin”).\nMost Australian Aborgines consider the word as offensive and, erroneously, associate it with abnormal.\n\nGail Blackman: When I look at the Indian Act it uses Indian and not Aboriginal..where did Aboriginal come from ?\n\nScott Duncan: ABORIGINAL = FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ALWAYS.\n\nScott Duncan: The ORIGINAL people cannot be touched under law, so they get you to declare that you have LEFT the original people, making you AWAY FROM the ORIGINALS. ABORIGINAL.

I hope that you and all your loved ones are in Great Spirit. I was wondering if I could please receive some assistance/pointers/ideas about a particular case I am presently dealing with.  I am here in Ontario, about five weeks ago we had a blackout in our city, I was at a major intersection helping to direct traffic for about 2 hours ( I am lucky there were hundreds of people witnessing this, so it is public record) a cop came to tell me that he would take over { & that I should go to another intersection} at the beginning of this (about 7pm), he didn't... 2 cars tried to run me over while helping (toward the very end of the 2 hrs.), I jumped on the hood of the second car to get out of the way, the people inside of the car attacked me while I was on top of their car asking what \"was wrong with them\", I threw punches back in defence, while I tried to get off the car.  I continued helping, about 10 mins. after the 2nd car incident the same cop came to tell me to get off the road, of course I complied, I went to retrieve my stuff, he began being belligerent toward me, calling me a nuisance, belittling me after I'd performed his job for 2 hrs or so.. I turned to the the about 10 people that were directly behind me for support, many of them had been video taping this throughout, asked them about his nuisance comment, they quickly in tandem told him that I was helping/being good/ to leave me alone.. this continued for a short while, I could not believe his imposing, outrageous attitude... being in awe by his insults and characterization, I told him that in our interaction I had been true to my word and that he was the one lying not only to me, but to the thousands of people that he refused to serve by directing traffic-- in my head thinking (I have been true to my word, I have testified true, this man is violent offensive and a liar, I'm done-- ... I testified by showing him my testes (the origin of the word), turned around showed him my butt & told him to suck on the left one (the people laughed)..  & I left peacefully walking my bike, not believing the amount of hate that man was giving out, when crossing the second intersection, cruisers surrounded me, he came out of the corner where we were speaking/arguing, he pointed at me and said \"you're going in\".. I said \" for what?\" he repeated it, I asked him again for what, he did not respond, at this point cops start grabbing at me, the people on the south/east corner that were supporting me raised their hands as a group & screamed to stop.. I screamed for them to help me & ran toward them, for aid & mediation, I hid behind them momentarily, they broke through them I realized my presence there put them in danger, as the cops just smashed through them.  So I decided to take off from there running, I got about a 75 meters away with them well behind me, but I realized my running was a moot point & that my best bet was to have witnesses.  I returned toward the same intersection running on the sidewalk, when I got close to the intersection they started beating on me, they had me under control, they threw me on to the street, cuffed me and proceeded to beat and pound on my body ( I am 5 '4, 135 lbs.), I had about 8 of them on my body, they tried to make me stop breathing, by pressuring on my chest, I asked to please stop, that I was not resisting, I was peaceful, but they smelled blood, so they continued... I gained a few broken ribs from this, a punctured and collapsed lung.. as well as 7 charges: 2 cops assaults, 2 assaults on the people that attacked me with their car and their fists, they lie/claim I broke their windshield,  1 property under 5000, public intoxication/ & disturbance.... there is multiple video and witnesses corroborating my story/ hundreds of witnesses in fact, there is medical record of the injuries sustained.. they refused me medical treatment, when I told them several times that I had broken ribs.  I am a free man on the land (since 2005) I have continually identified myself to them as such.. by stating my name as I am commonly known as so & so of the, so & so family/clan.  The step I'm at is awaiting their second disclosure date.. & it is time for me to start affirming to them that they've got the wrong guy in the wrong court, challenging their jurisdiction, any help is much appreciated, here on the board so we all learn, or as aprivate message,  thank you all so much beeautiful people.

(\"Enterprise\") on trademark issues.  It has recently come to my attention that you have registered and put to use the domain name,enterpriserentacarcanada.com,  which incorporates several of the family of trademarks owned by Enterprise without authorization (the “Domain Name”). \n \nIn addition, marks identical or confusingly similar to trademarks owned by Enterprise are used in metatags, text, hidden text and/or images on one or more of the websites.  These uses are likely to create consumer confusion by suggesting that you or your company is somehow affiliated with or sponsored by our famous Enterprise brand.\n \nFor decades, ENTERPRISE has been used as a service mark in connection with vehicle rental and leasing services, reservation services for the rental and leasing of vehicles, the sales of vehicles, and the repair of vehicles.  Enterprise owns U.S. Trademark Registration Nos. 1,343,167; 2,371,192; 3,548,422; 3,490,649; 3,479,308; 3,475,113; 3,581,022; and 3,547,336, EU Trademark Registration Nos. 5,647,987; 5,323,134; and 5,648,001.  By virtue of its well-established trademark rights in the U.S, E.U. and elsewhere, Enterprise enjoys the exclusive right to use the ENTERPRISE mark and related logo marks (“the Enterprise Marks”) in connection with these services, and others closely related.\n \nUse of the Enterprise Marks by you and your company in this way constitutes infringement of  Enterprise's federally registered service marks, as well as other violations of state and common law.\n \nEnterprise is committed to protecting its trademarks and enforcing its trademark rights against infringers as can be seen in various UDRP matters, including http://domains.adrforum.com/domains/decisions/1142637.htm.  However, Enterprise always strives to resolve these kinds of matters amicably and on a business basis between the parties.  We will consider the matter resolved if you promptly provide us with your written assurances that you and your company will immediately discontinue any and all use of marks owned by Enterprise in the Domain Name listed above, on websites and elsewhere, and take steps to transfer the Domain Name, and all other domain names in your possession that incorporate Enterprise Marks to Enterprise. \n \nPlease respond by   August 5, 2013  confirming that you agree to comply fully with the foregoing.

Now, if your going to post and comment on this, please do so in accord with the content, do rant about this or that bringing the content off to another realm, i know add and hdd is quite high but lets do our best to focus. Now, there are some ideas and concepts that have been written about and executed but who has successfully done this process and got what the full amount or at least an agreement on an amount ? \n\nFor me, i normally get whom im dealing with, to agree with my lien of course by their silence or inaction. All done normally out of a notary presentment process and gathering a record to show that a non response certified and an administrative judgment has been certified as well. With private courts out of my nation, a court order has been issued along with the administrative judgment which can be entered into the superior/supreme court as a foreign judgment in order to help with the enforcement of your claim. Keep in mind its all about the claims, i mean contracts. If one is to file a lien, they are to make sure they have done their administrative process in order to get the assent of the other parties. \n\nOnce done, its up to the party who got the contract to hold it, now this is where most if not all fail. Not many know how to hold a contract, keeping in mind that contracts are dynamic which means they move or can be moved by going in and arguing after the fact. This from what i can tell is called moving the contract or creating a situation for a judge to be granted the jurisdiction to make a judgement because you caused a controversy, you might say well, they started it and said there is no agreement. Which i would say why did you ask them to provide you proof of their claims, produce any records that would be in opposition of the records before the court, if in fact you get that far. Now, once you can get this record and there is an agreement for what the collateral is, what does one do in order to enforce if in fact they got the claim ? \n The Notary process can be explained in another posting but this here is mainly about placing a lien, whether on a house, car,boat or an account. I hear buzz of using CRA to place liens. Now, i dont wish to accept ideas or what you may think but actual true to fact information that some might know to be exact in their process. PPSA, UCC and the other forms of placing a lien, http://www.teranet.ca/ would be another place to file your lien as well. So if you would Scott Duncan, fill in the blanks for your position on a lien. Also, keep in mind, if you are able to hold your contract and get an order from a Superior/supreme court, you can take this order and have the U.S marshals come north of the border and execute enforcement for you.

For example CPS wants us to take a Parental Capacity Assessment and Psychological evaluation, we said no and that is why they pulled in the reins on our supervised access from being in the home to in their office for only two hours a week. But since this little situation with the kid having left foster care, and being returned, now they have decided that we get no visitation till the next court date at least ( and they are then looking to have the kids put into permanent care). So now they have broken their order by not allowing visitation, or getting that in judge approved to stop all visits for now. Or am I totally out to flipping lunch here?

(updated August 8, 2013)\n\nDerek Moran: LIGHTBULB just went off! > (PROPER NOTICE because a BILL is a TENDER FOR LAW).\n\nAs in- how can any CORPORATION deny you the ability to discharge your debt by way of the bill-payment-remittance THEY, sent YOU, in the first place?!? (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nDerek Moran: ... a BILL is a TENDER FOR LAW.......did THEY, not TENDER it to ME??\n\nDerek Moran: HOLY FUCK- so theres no need to go through all this Liening of the Property Tax Account Statement-instrument they sent us even to begin with..just accept the TENDER FOR LAW they offered us by sending in the bill-payment-remittance they provided!!! (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nScott Duncan: TENDER=CONDITIONALLY OPEN TO OFFERS.\n\nIn this example I am going to use Gail Blackman.\n\nIf you go to our corporate mail server http://mail.cdd.com, you will see a TENDER.\n\nIn this tender you can use CASH, or \"Serviced\" for service.\n\nThere are conditions. If she wishes to offer one of these for my services, she must abide buy the conditions.\n\nIf she arrives at the table with empty pockets, she is aware that she must bend over that table and lift her skirt. Business has not commenced, even though she'd clearly \"means business\", by doing that.\n\nAfter she is \"serviced\", she is now qualified to avail herself of the services I offer.\n\n...all sexual performance after the terms of the offer are fulfilled is purely recreational, and has nothing to do with the tender... like a tip.\nServer - mail.cdd.com - NO COMMERCE EXPECTED and/or IMPLIED\nmail.cdd.com\nServer - mail.cdd.com - NO COMMERCE EXPECTED and/or IMPLIED\nmail.cdd.com\n\nDerek Moran: I know-HUH??...what are they gonna do- take you court??..\"You're the FUCKIN' guys who sent it to me in the first-place..i just accepted YOUR, OFFER!\" (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nScott Duncan: THEY TENDERED, YOU ACCEPTED.\n\nGail Blackman: hmm let's see if I'm getting this....I could present you with a counter conditional offer ? and is this what we are doing when we send money when we receive a bill? (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nScott Duncan: Yes... And I can reject the counteroffer, as I am the one who offered the tender. YOU would have to come to ME to do business. It's not COMMERCE as it is not an advertisement. YOU must SEEK OUT the tender.\n\nDerek Moran: As in, the City possibly saying- \"Oh no, we dont accept payment THAT way.\"....\"OH??..then WHY, did YOU, SEND it, to ME, in the FIRST PLACE???\" (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nGail Blackman: so people are trying to pay their bills A4V, when all they have to do is to return the bill stating they accept the offer/tender which is the bill? (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nScott Duncan: Yes Gail.\n\nScott Duncan: Gail Blackman, what does the STAMP on a cancelled cheque mean?\n\nGail Blackman: accepted?\n\nScott Duncan: See? Easy, and you didn't even have to put out.\n\nGail Blackman: when sending it back..we simply write \"Accept\" on it? and if they question it, suggest they refer it to their legal dept?\n\nGail Blackman: the question would come from their own ignorance...like no one ever \"pays\" like that...im sure they are only used to counter offers of money?\n\nDerek Moran: GAIL- i have a friend who has Crawford and Falconbridge's Bills of Exchange book which he said says, all you have to print is ACCEPT at the top of the bill...'ACCEPTED-FOR-VALUE,' ACCEPT-FOR-VALUE, or A4V, is not necessary\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: And send it back to the offerer?\n\nDerek Moran: ..id take a photocopy of it before you registered-mail it\n\nGail Blackman: I agree..I'm talking more about accounts receivable clerks who would receive the confirmation of acceptance...and put you in the list for not \"paying\" and cut your services\n\nPete Daoust: You sent a registered mail envelop.??...how can they cut your service ???\n\nDerek Moran: The bank they ultimately deal with, will turn your $100 property-tax-bill-payment-remittance, into $2300 worth of credit.. credit the $100 back to the City.. leaving $2200 leftover for the bank to try and rule-the-world with even more with it\n\nDerek Moran: AND..........it all started with YOUR signature, they reverse-engineered everything we THOUGHT we knew about money\n\nScott Duncan: NO. You accepted the TENDER.\n\nThe dozy broad in accounts will escalate the issue to management. It USUALLY pays out like Derek describes.\n\nGail Blackman: I guess this is why they are soooo keen on automatic withdrawl to pay bills....they push it as a convenience for you but really it's for their own benefit...knew I never liked that offer\n\nGail Blackman: So I'm clear....all i have to do is write \"Accepted\" on the bill and return it registered mail?\n\nDerek Moran: ..there are a number of other things id do to it myself, Gail Blackman\n\nChad Brodgesell: @ Derek Moran, that's just 'fractional reserve banking though' isn't it?\n\nDerek Moran: Yup. Banks legally are allowed to counterfeit credit, basically. In Canada, the Fractional-Reserve-Rate/Ratio, is called either the CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENT, or the ASSET CAPITAL MULTIPLE. However, no promissory note-representing-debt + your signature = NO, CREDIT, for THEM. The rate is 23 in Canada, btw.\n\nChad Brodgesell: Nicely put. Was just checking cause we use different terms. I use general and you guys use the proper ones. This is how I approached the bank when I got my credit. I didn't know it was 23:1 though thought it was 12:1.\n\nDerek Moran: Barrons Law, BILL: a PROPOSITION or statement reduced to writing. In commercial law, an \"account for goods sold, services rendered and work done.\"\n\nDerek Moran: BILL(LEGISLATION): a draft of a PROPOSED statute submitted to the legislature for enactment.\n\nChad Brodgesell: I fired off a letter a while back asking the bank to clarify that it was my signature that created the credit to begin with and that on fractional reserve they had already been paid as their balance sheet would indicate and can they please send me a statement of account that was SIGNED by an authorized person. In 2 weeks time they had sold the account to a collection agency, never did get back to me. Not sure what I did was/is right but got them off my back.\n\nDerek Moran: BILL(NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS): Bills are all forms of paper money. see PROPOSITION, PROPOSED above\n\nChad Brodgesell: well that was like a year ago, but last week I fired off reg mail to the collection agency for them to produce a valid claim against me and if they could not do so then a charge of $10k for them to keep bothering me. I'll see how it goes.\n\nChad Brodgesell: This is the problem most of the time. Some stuff works but no one will verify WHAT it is that works.\n\nChad Brodgesell: Now I don't know what this is worth, but, EVERY time I ask for a SIGNATURE from who ever is whatever with me....the door slams shut.\n\nChad Brodgesell: I did get my former boss to ask the bank who was the GRANTOR of one of his buildings. Next week he told me he didn't want to talk about it.\n\nDerek Moran: CHAD- ask the bank for this: \"...for the original instrument of indebtedness in its original form.\"\n\nDerek Moran: The problem is, when we all opened-up a bank-account and never read the 10-page contract, they had language that apparently waived our right to discharge bill-payment-remittances in it. But, you cannot waive a right unless you did it with the express intent to.\n\nDerek Moran: on a financial instrument, you sign- 'without recourse'\n\nChad Brodgesell: Just asked for A SIGNED document back saying that (in my very fukked up wording) what I said wasn't true. I then found out they sold the account. m, can't say sold, they just called and said the matter had been 'sent' to collections.\n\nDerek Moran: \"the original instrument of indebtedness,\" is a promissory note, which considered to be the money you created with your signature.. and yes, they wont want to provide the original because its probably been marked-up from being Fraction-Banked, and evidence the bank has ALREADY been paid.\n\nChad Brodgesell: so, in essence thru basic general english I asked them to DENY that they already had been paid as soon as I signed,,on the dotted line.?\n\nDerek Moran: You know what- on second thought, someone brought-up a good point..not only do i think the SIN# doesnt have to be on the BILL-payment-remittance, like someone said, i think it would be construed as a tacit-agreement that you're a Government-employee by doing that...maybe Scott can verify that one way or the other\n\nKelleran Holman: Derek, does this notice then suggest that you agree that you are liable to a certain debt (it applies to you) to the Corp of Toronto, and now want to sort methods of settlement?\n\nDerek Moran: Good point.. they are not presenting it to Derek Moran.. they are presenting it to DEREK MORAN, they are just trying to get Derek Moran to act as SURETY for it\n\nDerek Moran: Kelleran- im doing this keeping in mind, that we do use the water..and they do pick-up our garbage-and-recycling.. this about enforcing the right to DISCHARGE debt, as opposed to PAYING them property-taxes with legal-tender from out of our pockets\n\nDerek Moran: I dont think it will make my fathers life easier for him by saying- \"Just tell the City you dont feel like paying taxes anymore\".. the City has given him the REMEDY, which is the bill-payment-remittance..im just trying to get him to wrap his mind around how credit is created\n\nDerek Moran: \"As I have already noted, a promissory note, by definition, involves an unconditional promise to pay a sum certain in money, but it is not itself money...there is no liquidation of the debt until it is DISCHARGED...\"\n\nhttp://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1977/1977canlii36/1977canlii36.html\nCanLII - 1977 CanLII 36 (SCC)\nwww.canlii.org\nBay Bus Terminal (North Bay) Limited and Bay Bus Terminal (North Bay) Limited na...See More\n\nJames Baal: Notice = valuable instrument = bill of exchange, exchange of what?

LeBlanc: James, One suggest reading the bills of Exchange act and the Bank act. Empower yourself.\n\nAdam Thomas: Yeah Jim. Do what jason says mate. Then it'll all fall into place. NEVER EVER PAY WITH MONEY ( legal tender) IN THEIR COURTS. Use a BoE instead PERFECT.\n\nAdam Thomas: ORDERS also come under BOE. Judge ORDERS ye to no longer bend over & clutch ankles. YOU AMEND THE ORDER YOURSELF. Fuck this stuff is sooo POWERFUL.... I wonder what would happen if it actually fell into the wrong persons hands ?\n\nDerek Moran http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/45-46/61\nBills of Exchange Act 1882\nwww.legislation.gov.uk\nAn Act to codify the law relating to Bills of Exchange, Cheques, and Promissory Notes.\n\nSonja Ruebsaat: can someone tell me more about how to go about this:\n\"Wise-man once said to get a STAMP made up for the back of any bill-payment-remittances you want to try using to discharge debt with... and what would that STAMP read, for it to be most effective exactly?\" I heard there is a stamp you can get made...connected to your bond...some sort of personal insignia and then you also write something on the bill/debt that it should be paid from your bond...\n\nDerek Moran: The STAMP, as i was told, is for the purpose of getting across the MESSAGE you want to CONVEY to the biller you're hoping has SOMEONE with the slightest knowledge of the purpose the bill-payment-remittance/coupon/voucher at the bottom of any particular BILL you are TENDERED from a biller is.\n\nDerek Moran: For instance- lets say a STAMP has room for only 4 or 5 lines on it...this is what I would put on MINE:\n\nBILLS OF EXCHANGE ACT, 1985\nsection 3. Thing done in good faith\nsection 9. Common law of England\nsection 57.1 Presumption of value (the most important one of all)\n“value” means valuable consideration.\n\nDerek Moran: If someone being paid a job to do on the other end doesnt understand any of this then that is not my fault..hire someone who is LEGALLY COMPETENT to deal with this. They TENDERED you a BILL, not to pay your debt, but, to DISCHARGE it, as PAYMENT of a debt is an IMPOSSIBILITY in lieu of GOLD being suspended-as-payment since 1933, and, you ACCEPTED it - what are they going to do, take you to court and tell the Judge that you had THE NERVE to ACCEPT what THEY tendered/OFFERED to you??\n\nDerek Moran: Apparently, what i was told, is that CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FUND=BIRTH CERTIFICATE, and BIRTH CERTIFICATE=CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FUND, and that the Consolidated Revenue Fund is actually mentioned in the Bills of Exchange Act, but, i was unable to find it.\n\nDerek Moran: Things i am fuzzy on were, where the STAMP goes on the bill-payment-remittance; the front, or the back. Another one, was that the bill-payment-remittance should be mailed registered-mail to THE BANK OF CANADA, as the Bank of Canada is the ONLY organization in 'Canada' that is able to create money/CREDIT from our SIGNATURE. They can do this, as the Bank of Canada as i understand it ultimately, is the one holding onto our SECURITY OF THE PERSON in their Clearing and Settlements House; not sure if that is exactly the TREASURY BOARD SECRETARIAT, or, CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. Another one was, register-mailing it straight to the Bank of Canada without the second-signature presumably from the biller already on it, as Scott has driven-home-the-point enough times that you MUST have TWO SIGNATURES (us, the biller), and, a TRUSTEE (the Bank of Canada); this begs the question whether or not it should be register-mailed back to the BILLER first for it to be the second-signature, then, they send the bill-payment-remittance now with TWO SIGNATURES into the Bank of Canada if they want to get 'paid.' (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nDerek Moran: Another important point was that it is the BILL, not the INSTRUMENT/REMITTANCE which is marked ACCEPT, but the BILL, meaning the upper-portion of the document NORTH of the perforated-edging-line you ultimately tear across. You DO NOT mark ACCEPT on the INSTRUMENT itself. You are ACCEPTING the BILL. Then, using the INSTRUMENT/REMITTANCE, to DISCHARGE, the BILL. (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nScott Duncan: http://bit.ly/ZQ6GC4\n\nBlake Gardner: I just indorse the private side and add my account number/social number, then send it to the CFO or the like with a brief cover letter outlining the tender and requesting a statement of zero account.\n\nDerek Moran: \"I just indorse the private side\".... what exactly does that mean- \"the PRIVATE side\"?.. i get lost in the whole public-side/private-side lingo\n\nBlake Gardner: The back of the instrument:-) like a cheque... The front is the public side...\n\nDerek Moran: So FRONT=PUBLIC=GOVERNMENT side... BACK=PRIVATE=US/OUR side, hmmm interesting. I would've assumed as US being the first-signature, that it just would've been put on the FRONT of the instrument...\n\nScott Duncan: Look at any promissory note. It is always \"BACKED BY\" someone/something.\n\nAdam Thomas: Signature = SURETY.\n\nBlake Gardner: \"Backed by\" - \"indorsed\" = on the back of...\n\nAlso as far as two signatures go, look up the word mark & seal - mark/logo/letterhead etc., is considered as their mark/signature/certification. So the front of these presentments/instruments usually have such identifying marks...it's also the reason most corporate correspondence usually comes without a signature but a letterhead/logo or the like instead.\n\nDerek Moran: Ohhh ok, so Scott, this is what you meant by when you said register-mail the bill-payment-remittance straight to the Bank of Canada, because, the biller already has their MARK/SEAL/SIGNATURE on the front of the instrument/remittance?\n\nDerek Moran: What required of corporation\n\n5. In the case of a corporation, where, by this Act, any instrument or writing is required to be signed, it is sufficient if the instrument or writing is duly sealed with the corporate seal, but nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the bill or note of a corporation to be under seal.\n\nhttp://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-4/page-2.html#h-3\nPART IGENERAL - Bills of Exchange Act\nlois-laws.justice.gc.ca\nFederal laws of canada\n\nBlake Gardner: Remittance is money sent by one person to another, either in specie, bill of ex- change, check, or otherwise.\n\nDerek Moran: Corporate Seal for the City of Toronto, although, i dont ever recall actually SEEING this before, let alone on the bill-payment-remittances:\n\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_237.pdf\n\nDerek Moran: Another question is how exactly is the proper way to MARK a bill-payment-remittance for proper presentment-and-acceptance. Section 190. explains somewhat how a Consumer bill or note is to be marked. Other than that, as i understand it:\n\n1. Print ACCEPT on the face of the BILL-payment remittance\n\n2. the empty AMOUNT-BOX needs to be filled in..give'em a $10 tip so as to less of a reason to be mad with you\n\n3. your SIGNATURE (thats a biggy) on the BACK (think 'Backed by'), not front, the BACK of the INSTRUMENT/REMITTANCE\n\n4. putting WITHOUT RECOURSE after your SIGNATURE, just in case they want to scare you with some legalese-talk\n\n5. putting the DATE on it would seem like a good idea\n\n6. the STAMP/MESSAGE you want to CONVEY to them (not sure whether on front or back)\n\n7. ???????????????????????\n\nhttp://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-4/page-38.html#h-28\nPART V CONSUMER BILLS AND NOTES - Bills of Exchange Act\nlois-laws.justice.gc.ca\nFederal laws of canada\n\nChiefRock Sino General: man, what is everyone going on about here.

It (stamps) certainly have an assigned value. The basic unit I believe is $.02 U.S. this is the lowest universal standard for the minimum cost of a stamp. It is the most basic tender for law, your most basic payment for contract, because when governments fail some system must be in place that ensures exchanges can occur between peoples in the case old government failure and collapse so a new one can be reestablished . A system has to be in place (and is) where people can continue to do shit -like contract with each other, the basis of all shit, and have some universal system in place so that shit can get done, no matter what....including what currency. This is where a completely electronic currency would should and will come in place....for one thing...no borders. No empty Forts full of metals we rape out of the ground that are more available in countries that....without it....would contribute Jack shit to the global economy. Other than our fucking greed, gold, for example, like silver and copper....makes a great conductor for electronics and should be used and valued as such.\n\nAnyhow.... I get why sheeps dont get shit. See...it all begins with understanding that money is debt. They CANNOT admit that. Once you admit that the answer is very simple: get rid of money and you get rid of debt. And since most politicians talk about debt, youd be getting rid of the need for most of them. Most of the \"police\" people wouldnt be needed. Youd be getting rid of greed....like our greed for gold thats really just another fucking metal. That I don't believe in. But nooooo you cant get rid of money because money is debt and debt exists to fuel greed and getting rid of greed? there's too much money in that. Money....?

ACC here in NZ replied with \"You have attempted to produce an inchoate instrument under the Bills of Exchange Act 1908. We do not accept this form of payment.\" New Zealands Law takes its definitions from Butterworth's Law Dictionary which defines the word 'inchoate' as the following... \"Begun but not completed. An inchoate offence is a preliminary offence such as attempt, conspiracy or incitement. An inchoate instrument is a partial or unfinished document or enactment. See Bills of Exchange Act 1908, s20.\n\nJoseph Davia: thanks Gerry - I didn't have the exact wording relating to their reply-still a refusal to accept is still a refusal to accept..?\n\nAdam Thomas: Theyre in DISHONOUR...CHECKMATE...\n\nAdam Thomas: The 5cent postage stamp with the RUBBER STAMP STATING.....STAMP DUTY PAID .....ON TOP OF THE 5CENT STAMP IS JOINDER FOR THE CROWN.

Utilization of stamps includes putting stamps on any documents (for clout purposes, not mailing) we wish to introduce into the system. As long as you use a stamp (of any kind) you are in the game. If you have time, resources, and the luxury of dealing with something well before expiration of a given time frame, you can use stamps that you consider ideal. The most preferable stamps are ones that are both large and contain the most colors. In an emergency situation, or simply if economy is a consideration, any stamp will do. Using a postage stamp and autograph on it makes you the postmaster for that contract.\nWhenever you put a stamp on a document, inscribe your full name over the stamp at an angle. The color ink you use for this is a function of what color will show up best against the colors in the stamp. Ideal colors for doing this are purple (royalty), blue (origin of the bond), and gold (king's edict). Avoid red at all cost. Obviously, if you have a dark, multi-colored stamp you do not want to use purple or blue ink, since your autograph on it would not stand out as well if you used lighter color ink. Ideally one could decide on the best color for his autograph and then obtain stamps that best suit one's criteria and taste. Although a dollar stamp is best, it is a luxury unless one is well off financially. Otherwise, reserve the use of dollar stamps for crucial instruments, such as travel documents. The rationale for using two-cent stamps is that in the 19th Century the official postage rate for the de jure Post Office of\n\nAdam Thomas: STAMP DUTY PAID\n\nDerek Moran: Gerry Cardinalli- do you have an 'Anything Done In Good Faith' section in your BoE, as we do here in Canada, its section 3. for us...

Otherwise, it would've been FRAUD- why? Because even as part of the NOBLE LIE it states in Genesis 1:26 that WE were to be given DOMINION over all of the earth. 'God'/The Creator, did NOT make governments, or corporations, or corporations masquerading as government in HIS supposed-likeness and gave them Dominion over ALL of the earth, he gave it to US.

Therefore it's a moral issue and I agree...but there is no mercy in equity....however since its all based on canon law there is forgiveness:-)\n\nChad Brodgesell: You are right. The Beneficiary can not be the Trustee at the same time. That is completely different from the word 'benefit'. One is used in Trust Law the other is used outside of Trust Law.\n\nBeneficiary is a Title (Position in something) , Benefit is not.\n\nChad Brodgesell: \"Who can forgive the Debt?\"\nWould that not be the holder of the debt?\n\nChad Brodgesell: A man hands the hotdog dude a Promissory note (bank note) and says, \"Sorry Hotdog Dude, all I got is this Note but I'm really hungry.\" Hotdog dude says \"Sure no prob. Instead of you promising to pay me later on, how about I give you the hotdog 'n' pop and I forgive you your Debt) ? Does that sound right? (Scott clicked 'Like')\n\nScott Duncan: PERFECT.\n\n...except the government assumes the debt.\n\nScott Duncan: It's up to the merchant to settle accounts with the government or eat the loss of the forgiven debt.\n\nChad Brodgesell: Ah....Right.....it's their debt note. (Scott clicked 'Like')\n\nChad Brodgesell: Their Debt taken from Our Credit I think. They created the Note. It's theirs we just use it. So ultimately they created a promise to pay that only they can Pay or Default on. I think I got that right.\n\nAdam Thomas Chad, WHO IS NOW THE HOLDER OF THE DEBT ??\nHow do you find out?? They've only given you a Legal Fiction in FULL DISCLOSURE.\nThey sold the debt & been PAID AGAIN.\n\nBlake Gardner: It's a novation of sorts.\n\nAdam Thomas: Wtf Blake ?? How do I go about to find out who actually has the ALLEGED DEBT?\n\nBlake Gardner: It's of course us in the end, and we are in reality loaning money to ourself - private>public novation circle...however discloser is not a solution nor the point, imo...it's just another remedy in and of its self:-)\n\nYou can bank on the public never disclosing - it is a public's policy - thus you can bank on getting an unrebutted agreement to your contracts/offers every time and therefore, being able to hold them if they are, voluntary based and of reasonable expectation.\n\nAdam Thomas: All well & good Blake, but if they haven't the ORIGINAL CONTRACT then what's that make the situation ??\n\nBlake Gardner: A new offer makes the old offer moot...likewise a new contract agreed to makes the old contract moot.\n\nBlake Gardner Well I'm of the opinion it's meant to be...something for everybody...a public infrastructure with the option of guardianship (benefits for governance) or the private for those who prefer self governance.\n\nBlake Gardner: I'm pretty sure it can go on indefinitely, or at least as long as is desired or more importantly necessary. It's fiction - after all...new characters, stories lines and plots can be written in at any stage and consent manufactured to corroborate. (Scott clicked 'Like')\n\nAdam Thomas: Manufactured Consent.

The plastic is melted in to the fibers of the bond paper there by altering it. Putting it in a plastic sleeve is better.\nThe question of laminating documents has come up a lot. If the issuers of said document did not issue it laminated (such as the D.L.) then it should not be ALTERED.\n\nPete Daoust: OK Chad Brodgesell, we ALL know that if we laminate the BC with plastic film, it will be altered....the question was: WHY is it we can NOT do it, why is it we can NOT alter it...\n\nChad Brodgesell: YOU CAN NOT FUCKING ALTER THE SAID DOCUMENT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO.\n\nPete Daoust: The answer would be more like: NO! there are detailed security features on a birth certificate that is not originally laminated. If you laminate/tape etc it will NOT be accepted. So I don't see anything related to AUTHORITY in this, the security features seems to be the reason, like laminating a $10 bill would make the same effect.....That is the MOST valuable answer I've find so far....\n\nChad Brodgesell: Security features. Mmmmmm..\nSo if you laminated it these features would not be able to be inspected properly. SO IF YOU FUCKING LAMINATED IT THAT WOULD \"\"\"ALTER\"\"\" THE THING TO THE POINT WHEN THOSE SECURITY FEATURES WOULD NOT BE ACCESSIBLE.\nPlus, you DO NOT have the AUTHORITY to alter the document.\n\nDerek Moran: My BC is laminated. I, nor my family did it. Went to ServiceOntario to ask questions regarding it. The girl at the counter automatically gave me shit for it when she saw it was laminated. After i went- \"AHEM,\" she took a look at the date of it and went- \"OH, well...we stopped doing that SINCE then.\" She did tell me that one of the numbers on it, was a- \"tracking number.\" The number she was referring to, was the CUSIP number...\n\nChad Brodgesell: Yes those are the results of ALTERING without the authority too. Forgery is not altering a document, it is creating a new one without the authority to do so.\n\nWho-are You Frisbey: well sure they can laminate it it's theirs it's their property they made it they can do with it what they want\n\nChad Brodgesell: The act of altering or creating something CREATES the offence of forgery and/or counterfeiting...when you do not have the authority to do so\n\nWho-are You Frisbey: they also have to prove intent\n\nChad Brodgesell: If you do not have the authority to alter and/or create something but you go ahead and do it then by one or more of those actions you have committed the offence of forgery and/or counterfeiting.\nWhether you get caught and/or convicted is a different story.\n\nChad Brodgesell: Pete Daoust do you have the authority to create a B.C.? A Canadian Bank Note? A D.L.?\nNo you do not. So if you alter or create those then you have committed a crime. Do you comprehend that?\n\nPete Daoust: So if you alter or create those then you have committed a crime: And who will be the injured partie.. ? \n\nIf I laminate a BC, it is a crime ?, if I cut a $20 in 4, it is a crime ?\n\nChad Brodgesell: Yes Pete Daoust , \"If you do not have the authority\" think about that.\nThat would only apply to something within the jurisdiction of the authority in the first place. \n\nPete Daoust: Sorry....it dosen't make sense when you bring this authority thing in the picture....where have you got that information ?....common sense ?...I just can't get it, and I will prove you this, I will get my BC out as we speak, I will write FUCK YOU on it, and I garanty you that NOTHING will happen, I will use one of the 20 certified copy if I need it in the future...\n\n I can do the same with a $20 bill I also have in my pocket\n\nWho-are You Frisbey: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership\n\nDaniel J Wentz: I've known Scott Duncan, a very long time.\n\nAll of this will be used against you later on. That's the only reason he doesn't just ban you. I've had my finger poised on the button myself.\n\nYou may have figured this out by now, but Scott is a lot smarter than any of you.

I went down to the court house to finish the paper work and get a claim started to get my property back. When I got there I was told to have a seat and as soon as someone was finished with doing something with another client that they would deal with me. As I sat waiting, I noticed an RCMP officer heading to the front door of the courthouse. Of course he was coming in my direction and when he got close enough, he asked if I was Brenda. I stated that I am commonly called Brenda. He told me that he had a recording device and that it was there to record what I said and he said, so that way he couldn’t say I had said something and I couldn’t say he said something. (Funny how recording devices work!) So he told me he was there to talk about my missing daughter. I told him that I had no comment. Asked if I was under arrest. He stated no, and told me that I wasn’t under arrest or being detained. Then he moved on to a picture and stated is this your daughter, and I didn’t answer him. He told me that he was working with cps to try and locate her. Did I know where she was? No comment. Could I at least tell the officer if she was safe? No comment. I am here to get my documents. Are my documents ready yet? The stupid bitch behind the counter holds up a finger. Then some other people come walking in and the officer wants to know if I want to go into the lobby to talk. I didn’t acknowledge anything. So while we are sitting there waiting for the people to leave and my paper work to be ready, I asked the officer a question. If I want to make a complaint that my daughter is missing would you take that complaint? So what daughter is that, you have three right? Catherine is 15, and Carole is 13 and handicapped? And you have an older daughter. I said I'm only talking about the youngest one. If I want to make a complaint about my youngest one missing would you take that complaint? Well, he says, I know that cps has told me that she is fine where she is, I haven’t actually seen her, but they say she is fine. So you would not take my complaint? No cps says she is safe and fine. So I got up to pay for my paperwork and get the fuck out of there. He took his recorder and talks into it, stating that it is Aug. 1, 2013 at 10:34 am and talking to Brenda Larson. I said by what authority do you address me as Brenda Larson? Oh well that is just what I am saying into my recorder. He left and I got my paper work, and left as well. When I left I saw him standing on the opposite side of the street with his back turned to the courthouse. So I left and walked behind a strip mall, looking for the van, I spotted it. But practically next to it, was a Sheriffs truck, so I knew what was going on. I just kept on walking, and the van knew what was going on. Unfortunately, I had forgotten my cell phone but found a place to use the phone. The Sheriff kept pretty close to me and I was able to duck them when they were right outside a place of business, I went into to use the phone to be able to call and let the van know where I was headed. I rounded out the back of the building went through some back yards and was home free. Things should be heating up here shortly.

RICO allows average citizens (private attorneys general) to sue those organizations or government officials in their private capacity that commit mail and wire fraud as part of their criminal enterprise.

In Canada We have probably the most discriminatory legislation involving \"injured workers\". While everyone believes Canadians enjoy a high level of health care there is one group excluded from the Canada Health Act. While touted as being inclusive of all Canadians, injured workers are discriminated against and excluded if they accept Workers Compensation Insurance. To add further discrimination each Province of Canada removes an injured workers legal rights. How can any seriously injured person get well and back to work at something if they are denied all benefits and actually become sicker because of the medical neglect? Welfare and charities only provide very basic needs and sometimes not even enough for food or heat and light. Good honest, decent, hardworking, men and women having numerous insurance frauds committed against them that literally kills them. In Canada these agencies are disobeying a direct Order of the Supreme Court of Canada to compensate financially and medically for Chronic Pain caused by injuries. Forced into poverty and losing all they worked for, suffering unbearable pain, rights taken and subsequent psychological abuse, many injured workers commit suicide. Others die of heart attack, stroke, or ulcers bought on by Chronic Pain. This is happening in every workers compensation system. I call it genocide. Eugenics of the unfit, disabled. Everything mankind has fought against for thousands of years. Inequality and injustice kills us. The responsible party causing so much harm is the Crown. It is they who are supposed to protect the people from criminal insurance gangs cutting off medical and financial aid to seriously sick or injured people. It is they who allow, condone, permit, these bad faith insurance practices to happen. We are dealing with an International crime syndicate responsible for the murders of 100's of 1,000's of individuals they have deemed as \"disabled\". Once they have that evidence, the appeals and abuses start. As a matter of fact the Workers Compensation Board of Ontario, Canada, has declared me dead and have cut off my disability pension now for over a year. All I can say to that is; 'Don't you think I type quite eloquently for a dead man?\" Rise up \"injured workers\" everywhere in the Commonwealth. Demand your basic rights to justice be enforced and demand the investigation, arrest, and prosecution of those responsible for these crimes against humanity. Demand the bonus system which is obtained illegal money taken as a percentage of denied serious injury claims be abolished. no more cutting off injured workers medications and therapies to obtain a bonus! Go to my site on Youtube. Watch my videos about 9/11 first Responders in America and their horrendous mistreatment. The Gulf Oil Spill victims, and many more.

On or about the same time, President Roosevelt, quietly through Congress claimed all property, both real and living, to be \"subordinate to the interest of government,\" effectively seizing elodial and equitable title (as distict from legal title) to all property, including the people themselves, so that the government might borrow there upon the same serving as surety and collateral, for loans from international bankers, in violation of the 10th and 13th Amendments (prohibiting slavery).\nRoosevelt's unlicensed lawyer and top economic ad-visor, Col. Edward Mandell House, in support of the plan for econmoic enslavement of the entire population has been quoted as saying : \"...[E]very American will be required to register their biological property in a National system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient (admiralty Maritime) system of pledging (themselves as contribution or tribute to government)... By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will affect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register (by birth certificate, social security card, and drivers licence) or suffer not being able to work and earn a living. They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions ( or presumed obligations in statutory jurisdiction in corperate courts). This will inevitably... leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call 'Social Insurance.' \"\n\nHOW SLAVES TO LEAGALITY ARE LAWLESSLY RULED\n\nArticle Three of the Constitution establishes the judiciary for the people, fully vested with their rights. Article One and Four establish the executive and legislative branch, which can create \"administrative courts,\" that mimic law courts with legality, legalese, and leagalism (religion teaches is black magic, witchraft and sophistry - or, the art of lying) to handle internal government affairs of employees and agents of government, who have no more rights than military personnel who have signed stewardship and ownership of themselves over to government, to be treated as \"wards\" you might say. All Article Three Courts, which are empowered to recognize your rights as a free citizen, have been entirely supplanted, and replaced since the Civil War and the Great Depresion, with Aticle One, and Article Four, Legislative or Executive branch administrative courts, all the way down to your local circuit, district, or municiple state court, and their operations have aditionally been Privatised, to create a role reversal between you and government, to treat you, the private person, as a public institution, subject to the legaleese of fictions, while the government operates as a private corperation, masquerading as a public institution. These courts cannot recognize the rights of a person not employed, or owned by government.\n\nThe general misconception is that any statute passed by legislators bearing the appearance of law constitutes the law of the land. A \"Statute\" is not a \"law,\" (Flournoy v. First Nat. Bank of Shreveport, 197 La. 1067, 3 So.2d 244, 248), and a concurrent or joint resolution of legislature is not \"a law,\" (Koenig v. Flynn, 258 N.Y. 292, 179 N.E. 705, 707; Ward v. State, 176 Okl. 368, 56 P.2d 136, 137; State ex rel. Todd v. Yelle, 7 Wash.2d 443, 110 P.2d 162, 165), Nor is 'Code' \"Law\" (In Re Self v Rhay, 61 Wn (2d) 261) these being defined by Black's Law Dictionary as rebuttable prima facie, or superficial, evidence of law, a facade, represented by 'public policy,' being color-able, or 'color of law,' being 'counterfeit or feigned' as defined. As the Supreme Court has warned, \"Because of what appear to be Lawful commands on the surface, many citizens, because of their respect for what appears to be law, are cunningly coerced into waiving their rights, due to ignorance.\" ( U.S. v. Minker, 350 U.S. 179, 187 ). The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and any inferior federal or state act, code, title or statute, derived from or predicated upon the original contract for government, to be valid, must be In agreement therewith. - 16 Am Jur 2d, Sec 177 late 2d, Sec 256.\n\nThe courts today operate on the presumption that you are owned by government, (chattle property) an 'asset', or 'human resource', an agent, representative, or employee, an 'office,' or 'department' of government, only by the birth certificate, and other 'Union' memberships they have created for you, a contract for slavery, that you never knowingly and intentionally signed, bearing your foot prints. Clever.\n\nThe act of registering a child contracted them as chattel, and the birth record was a deceptive legal way of getting the parents to sign the baby away. The birth record was in fact a promissory note that was converted into a slave bond, which was then sold to a private reserve bank effectively giving ownership of the child to the bank.\nEach new baby’s contract was sealed by either a drop of their blood or by an ink impression of their foot onto the birth record, as was done with paupers upon their death certificate probating their estate. This ‘signature’ was used to create their lifetime value, evidenced by their labor and the taxes and costs of that labor as monetized currency – all designed to keep people in servitude for their entire lifetime.\nThe banks have been the modern slave owners and as the saying goes, “He who owns the debt owns the people.” The way the Slavery System was imposed on us meant that even if we did end up paying off our house or our car, we never actually owned it, because our right to any Real Property ownership was given away at the registration of our birth.\nThis has been legal process since 1540 via something called a Cestui Que (Vie) Trust, and this was still in effect until the recent UCC Rulings changed the legal landscape and reinstated the un-rebuttable fact that no-one, and no corperation or government, can own our ‘selves or own our bodies. The slavery system has remained intact for so long because of educational doctrines, the influence of our community at large and because so many people accepted and embraced their slavery by waiting for others to help them or to tell them what they should/could or should/could not do. Enforcers like the police and courts made sure we stayed within the slavery system and incarcerated us if we chose to live as FREE individuals.\nIn fact, the slavery system was imposed on us all (and maintained for centuries) by building walls in our minds through propaganda and conditioning, creating the false belief that we did not deserve better, that we were not part of a greater plan and that we should instead be happy with the handouts, crumbs and ‘indulgences’ given to us by the Powers That Were (PTW), while the system itself reaped in millions of dollars every year, directly from the sweat and blood of our labor in bondage to the witchcraft of legalism as slaves.\n\nBut you can remove yourself from their corperate jurisdiction, or begin to at any rate. Memorize this, and you will avoid a lot of trouble, a lawyer taught me long ago. The court calls the case of the State v Me (You). \"Im here on that.\" You state. \"Are you this (so and so) person the Judge asks? \"NO (you must say)... \"The name was given to me, but I am not the name, and I refuse to plead not guilty, a negative that cant be proved, as I am innocent of any crime, and i do not consent to being judged or tried in any court except an Article III constitutional court of record for the protection of my life liberty and property rights, and if the person of the court pleads for me surety is transferred to that person in his private capacity for the national debt.\"\n\nThat \"Fiat Paper Currency\" Col edward Mandel House proclaimed would \"secure a chargeback\" for your slavery, is in fact forged or counterfeited money or value, and any demand for payment can be responded to as follows :\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF INABILITY TO PAY COST AND FEES\n\nAN UNREBUTTED AFFIDAVIT STANDS AS TRUTH IN COMMERCE\n\nBeing Duly deposed and Sworn, Affiant, autographed in Blue and sealed by thumb print in red ink below, states as follows:\nI can make no Payment on any debt or obligation to pay pursuant to costs, fees, any contract, settlement, or order of the court, until the form of payment is clarified and defined, considering the following :\nFACT ONE\nNeither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities, as deposits are merely book entries, and it is still a Felony to tender these or any such substitute, electronically or otherwise for lawful money in many States today including Texas. As Texas criminal law states “All recognizances, bail bonds & undertakings of any kind, whereby a party becomes bound to pay money to the State, & all fines & forfeitures of a pecuniary character shall be collected in the lawful money [gold or silver, not legal tender federal Reserve Notes] of the United States only.” TEXAS Code of Criminal Procedure § 43.02. the Supreme Court has ruled that \"Lawful Money of the United States could only be gold & silver coin or that which by law is made its equivalent so as to be exchangeable therefor at par, & on demand, & does NOT include a currency which though nominally exchangeable for coin at its’ face value, is not redeemable on demand.\" Bronson v. Rhodes, 74 U.S. 229, 247, 19 L. Ed.141. “Checks, drafts, money orders & bank notes are not lawful money of the United States.\" (State v. Mellon, 73 Pac. 321, 43 Ore. 168. Black’s Law Dictionary 6th Edition defines “Real money,” as; “Money which has real metallic, intrinsic value as distinguished from paper currency, checks & drafts.”\nFACT TWO\nNo state may make any thing but gold or silver coin tender in payment of debts (Article 1 sec 10, US Constitution), yet no payment in gold or silver may be demanded in payment of any debt or obligation because of government declared bankruptcy. ( HJR 192; Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111, and 6260, House Joint Resolution 192 of June 5, 1933; 31 USC 5112, 5119;12 USC 95a; confirmed in Perry v. U.S. 294 U.S. 330-381, 79 LEd 912 (1935)).\nFACT THREE\n\"The legal tender quality of paper money is only valuable for the purposes of dishonesty.\" (Knox v. Lee 79 U.S. 457 (1871) \" and By agreeing to pay fines, court costs, or any other obligation or debt in monetary exchange or commerce with any public institution by such means, weather or not being tricked or coerced by rogue government or any representative thereof into paying any debt, obligation, or fine, in anything other than gold or silver, one would be as such either pressured, intimidated, coerced and threatened or induced under duress, drawn into, or conspiring to engage in the crime of 'counterfeiting' and forgery, a felony, and so should and must respectfully decline and resist any pressure to accept any offer and reject, any inducement to be pressured or drawn into contributing, aiding and abetting, weather directly or indirectly, any manner of criminality, such as defined in and by law as 'forgery' and the 'counterfeiting' of money or value.\nFACT FOUR\n“No person shall ever be imprisoned for debt.” - Constitution of the State of Texas Art. 1 § 18, 1876. “No man can give that which he has not... [nor that which he can not be required to have, such as contraband Federal Reserve Bank Notes counterfeited as money].” (Jackson v. Bradford, 4 Wend.

She = Ma. Justice \"informed me\" that VOIDing wouldn't work and only terminating would(contrary to another justice who didn't bother getting a new order). So once it was granted, i had a feeling something was about to go down.\n\nmet up with an old friend had a few beers, made a drunk-ish comment, but i didn't carry through was distracted with other things. When i was walking on riverside, I was suddenly stopped by a cop car, 2 minutes after another 3 patrol cars come up. They arrested me because i was alleged to breach the restraining order. They said that my \"freeman bullshit\" wont work. They were very aggressive when I was arrested and cuffed, one of the cop grabbed my neck and threw me in the back seat. Unfortunately i didn't get any other badge numbers because i was at a heightened sense alert because i seriously though i was gonna get kicked in.\n\nWas sent to the cop shop in windsor where they took my stuff. They tried to  take my earrings out, I told them no. Cop officer \"217\" Constable(i believe) informed me if i did not comply and if i give them reason to believe I'm a freeman that they would have no problem throwing me in a chamber and make my stay hell. He also threatened the taser if i didn't comply. I complied under extreme duress. The last time i was tasered my heart beat became irregular. Not enough to be a problem but not normal. Don't ask I don't know much more on that.\n\nAt this point, I did not have the opportunity to serve a notice of mistake but I knew it off by heart so i can recite it straight from memory if needed. They threw me in HC02, a cell for 1 person.\n\nMultiple times I was taken out for fingerprints(the officer told me to not say a word, and he didn't need my consent. If i didn't comply he would taser me(different cop)). There was other times where i was thrown in another room just blank, then put back into HC02. I was thrown in other guys, then pulled again back to HC02.\n\ni was held overnight until Saturday morning. I was very dehydrated. The water fountain+shitter+pisser in one wasn't functioning. The officer explained that he did not give me food/drinks because \"i believed i was above the government and laws, so i don't need government help\". He brought juice a few hours later.\n\nI had some sort of hearing to see if I would be remanded or released. I knew I wasn't going to be released. The clerk asked for my name, i said it wasn't mine to give and that there was a mistake in identifying the accused. Officer stated that they had evidence by way of a mug shot to confirm that i am such and such. The CROWN did not consent on my release because they said that their secondary grounds were that I believed that I was ABOVE THE LAW. I was pulled back into my cell. An officer came in badge#517 i want to say, told me to comply and drop my freeman bullshit. And that if i did it again that i would get whats coming to me. I told them that if any harm comes to me they would be liable. And that they have no right to tell me what i can and cannot say.\n\nI was transfered to the brock. The officers who were putting me in told the guards that I was a freeman and to show him the way we treat \"outlaws\". I was thrown into an isolation chamber. I was there for about a few hours, then I was thrown in range c left. This was Protected Custody. When I was thrown in there the guard announced that I was fresh meat and to show me how they treat new guys. Fortunately they locked me in my cell for Saturday. I couldn't get my dinner because the other inmates took everything but the toast. Which was cold. Meals were pretty much a free for all.\n\nSunday morning. I was told by my inmates that if i didn't do the \"initiation\" that they would gang beat me. I did it out of fear. Did 120 squats in a row. Well...not in a row but you take 1 step do 1 squat take another step do 2...etc, i made it to 15 and collapsed. I was incapable to walk for an hour. Guard told me to get out I couldn't move fast enough so he belly clobbed me with his stick right in my legs. I was on the ground, almost crying from pain. I was put into an isolation chamber, was given my 30 minutes to do whatever then back I went. I was moved back to range c Monday  morning. Then an hour later was brought to court.\n\nmeanwhile i had the notice of mistake prepared to file, but I could not file it without an affidavit. I informed that i must file a document into the case file. Officer \"3xx\" said no and that i would have to take it up with court. I was pulled from my cell around 11:30am to go take the phone, it was duty counsel. She asked if i wanted her help i said no. She asked what was my intention. I told her it was not her concern.\n\nAround 1:05pm Monday i was brought to court hearing. it was a video hearing. For bail. Hold on to yourselves. This is the part where the railroading really kicks in. I get in there and the CROWN was about to speak when i said i RESERVE ALL RIGHTS. The justice immediately stated that she did not want to hear my freeman arguments and therefor she will ignore me. Then a woman stands up, stated that she talked to me and speaks for me, she agrees with the CROWN to remand me until such time. I was objecting the shit out of it, but the officer beside me laughed and said i was muted. I was FUCKING PISSED OFF. First they refuse to file my documents and now they just mute me? While i was going back to the cell an officer bumped into me hit my leg, i began to limp. The officer that brought me to the video hearing asked what was wrong. I told him what happened. He just replied with \"Oh really now?\" He proceeded to take my leg muscle and put pressure onto it. It immediately shot me down to the ground. It was fucking painful.\n\nAnyways, i was returned back to brock. Was put back in range c. When the inmates saw my muscles sore, they began to punch, poke, flick, anything to cause a quick burst of pain. By Monday night I was exhausted from enduring the pain. I couldn't sleep well. Worse then normal for jail.\n\nTuesday morning. I woke up in so much pain i couldn't get off my bed. Amigo my inmate helped me down. I asked for the nurse(i had sports injuries and pulled muscles, but this pain was on another level) to go see what he can do. He replied and announced that i was a cry baby and to suck it up. I was harassed even more. the other inmates took turns punching my legs until i was in so much pain i couldn't defend myself anymore. I was shaking and crying from all the pain.\n\nI was brought to Court. When i got there. I was put on the ball and chain. Was thrown in BP03. Bull Pen #3. I couldn't sit because of the pain, i couldn't stand because of the pain. I was overwhelmed with pain that i felt that i was going to black out. When the officer came to get me for some call I told him i REQUIRED an affidavit and my notice of mistake to be filed. HE said no its not his job and talk to duty counsel. I told him right away i did not want duty counsel. \n\nHe said tough luck they wont hear you without one.\n\nI went into the booth. It was duty counsel again i declined again.\n\nWhen i was brought out an officer asked what my answer was. I said no. HE was pissed off and 3 other officers walked towards me. One of the officers was the one who arrested me and thrown me in the back of his cop car. I was thrown in a waiting room(?). They threatened me that if i didn't drop the freeman bullshit that they would kick the shit out of me. I said it was the law. It was not my problem. The officer 217 took his baton and wailed it right at my legs. I immediately screamed in pain and was on the ground shaking violently from the pain. They asked again 3 more times i said no. They hit one in the ribbed, threw me against the wall, punched my abdominal. They asked again. They said that if i didn't comply that they would taser me and beat me relentless. I grunted and complied for fear of my life.\n\nThey said to plead guilty and accept a probation or they will arrest me again and keep me there for 30 days at least. I couldn't deal with it. I was in so much pain the pain was drowning my thoughts. I pleaded guilty, knowing that if i did not that i would be beaten and my life to be in serious jeopardy. 3-4 officers(cant remember) escorted me to the office where i would sign the probation sheet. One of the officers told me to sign it normally no rights reserved bullshit. \n\nUnder threat of my life i did.\n\nAfter i was released i immediately called 911, went to the hospital. took me about 90 minutes to get a bed and see a doctor. I could not move my legs often and when i could it was painful. John something gave me pain relief meds and an anti-inflammatory cream. It relieved a lot of pain but it was just bearable. I had bruises in some spots, asked him to take pictures for evidence, he said its not needed. I said i needed it for documentation. HE said he couldn't. I would have taken pictures but for some reason they didn't bring my stuff to the court house. I could not go to the jail house in my current condition. Was just not happening. I took a piss and blood sample. Blood sample came back said my liver was out of whack. The doc said that the levels of something(not a doc cant remember these damn 10 syllable words) and that its normally a result of doing hard drugs. I told him i only do weed and drink the occasional beer and hard liquor. He said that he would send it for further analysis. My piss was pitch black. You couldn't see through it. It didn't look like blood, but the doc said that it is most likely from my liver. He said that it would take around 48 hours to process it.\n\nHE also gave me an appointment at the hospital to go see a neurologist Friday at 11am. HE said someone just canceled so asked if i wanted it. I took it right away, getting an appointment like that that fast was a opportunity i could not pass up on it.\n\nI was released and walked about a block until a good Samaritan gave me a ride. It took me 2 minutes just to get in her car. But i thank her greatly for her kindness.

How is that protection? So the following post is a post from i assume a lawyer of some kind with many cases from courts as evidence that Originals nations do not have the rights you think you do here in so called Canada ?\n---------------------http://www.quatloos.com------------------------------------\nThe items you have identified are not ones that I understand are authorized by law in Canada. That broader kind of self-governance may be something that emerges in the future, but if it does, that will be decided by Canadian provincial and federal politicians, and aboriginal politicians. I will not comment one way or another on if I think that is right or wrong - that is not a subject for Quatloos, in my opinion.\n\nI suspect comments on the legitimacy of certain actions in places like the Middle East would also fall into this prohibition. Only a guess.\n\nIf I’m wrong on this I am sure the administrators will straighten me out.\n\nSo instead, to law. I understand aboriginal people in Canada have special rights, and that these are protected by the Constitution via the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 35:\n\n    35(1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.\n\n    (2) In this Act, \"aboriginal peoples of Canada\" includes the Indian, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada.\n\n    (3) For greater certainty, in subsection (1) \"treaty rights\" includes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.\n\n    (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in subsection (1) are guaranteed equally to male and female persons.\n\nA couple quick observations, you will notice that Canada’s law treats Indian, Inuit, and Métis in the same way. I know you previously wondered whether law concerning the Métis applies to other aboriginal peoples, and as you can see here, it does.\n\nThere are two kinds of rights recognized explicitly: aboriginal rights, and treaty rights. Treaty rights are something I’ll talk about later, but let us first discuss what are aboriginal rights. The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507 said these rights are part of aboriginal culture: “... an aboriginal right an activity must be an element of a practice, custom or tradition integral to the distinctive culture of the aboriginal group claiming the right ...” and that is a “... crucial [element] of the distinctive aboriginal societies that occupied North America prior to the arrival of Europeans ...”.\n\nAboriginal rights are not just treaty rights, but exist even after Britain and then Canada took authority over this land. It was put this way in Tsilhqot’in Nation v. British Columbia, 2012 BCCA 285 at para. 167:\n\n    The assertion of Crown sovereignty did not, as a matter of common law, serve to extinguish the pre-existing traditional rights of First Nations, and those rights survived. Aboriginal rights, then, are recognized rather than created by the common law.\n\nSo you see, common law and aboriginal rights are different.\n\nThere are a huge number of cases that talk about aboriginal rights and when they still exist today. I am going to just look at one Supreme Court of Canada case, Lax Kw'alaams Indian Band v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 56 (http://canlii.ca/t/fnr69) as it is quite recent and illustrates how these rights work. In this case a group of British Columbia Indian bands claimed they had an aboriginal right to operate a commercial fishery. The Supreme Court said they did not.\n\nThis is a four step process (see para. 46):\n\n1) what is the actual right claimed?\n\n2) has the aboriginal group proved “(a) the existence of the pre-contact practice, tradition or custom advanced in the pleadings as supporting the claimed right and (b) that this practice was integral to the distinctive pre-contact Aboriginal society.”\n\n3) is the modern claimed aboriginal right ‘connected’ to the pre-contact practice:\n\n    Third, determine whether the claimed modern right has a reasonable degree of continuity with the “integral” pre-contact practice. In other words, is the claimed modern right demonstrably connected to, and reasonably regarded as a continuation of, the pre-contact practice? At this step, the court should take a generous though realistic approach to matching pre-contact practices to the claimed modern right. As will be discussed, the pre-contact practices must engage the essential elements of the modern right, though of course the two need not be exactly the same.\n\n4) what is a modern form of the aboriginal right that is fair to both the aboriginal people and Canadians as a whole.\n\nIn this case there was absolutely no question that the Indian band’s ancestors had engaged in an extensive fishery, so that was clearly an aboriginal right. What they had not done is engaged in a commercial fishery. They did not engage in trade of fish or fish products in a manner that made that “an integral part of their distinctive culture”: para. 52.\n\nThere is a complication in that an aboriginal right that existed at contact can be taken away, or \"extinguished\", by either a treaty or by a “unilateral act of the sovereign”. The treaty part is simple - if a treaty for example limits the area of land used by an Indian band to do something then that “extinguishes” the aboriginal right to do things outside that space. “Unilateral act of the sovereign” means just that - the Crown (Britain or Canada) has created rules, usually legislation, that takes away a right to do something by displacing it.\n\nI found a case that is very helpful in understanding when a treaty or aboriginal right is extinguished: Mitchell v. M.N.R., 2001 SCC 33 (http://canlii.ca/t/521d). Mohawks from Akwesasne claimed they had an aboriginal right to import things into Canada without paying customs. They argued this was a modern extension of their traditional trade practices. The Supreme Court of Canada talks about when rights are extinguished.\n\nYou have asked why aboriginal communities do not have full rights today? The law for that is explained at para. 9:\n\n    Long before Europeans explored and settled North America, aboriginal peoples were occupying and using most of this vast expanse of land in organized, distinctive societies with their own social and political structures. The part of North America we now call Canada was first settled by the French and the British who, from the first days of exploration, claimed sovereignty over the land on behalf of their nations. English law, which ultimately came to govern aboriginal rights, accepted that the aboriginal peoples possessed pre-existing laws and interests, and recognized their continuance in the absence of extinguishment, by cession, conquest, or legislation: see, e.g., the Royal Proclamation of 1763, R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1, and R. v. Sparrow, 1990 CanLII 104 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, at p. 1103. At the same time, however, the Crown asserted that sovereignty over the land, and ownership of its underlying title, vested in the Crown: Sparrow, supra. With this assertion arose an obligation to treat aboriginal peoples fairly and honourably, and to protect them from exploitation, a duty characterized as “fiduciary” in Guerin v. The Queen, 1984 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335.\n\nSo there you go. Pre-contact aboriginal rights were removed by cession (aboriginal people not using those rights), conquest (self-explanatory) or legislation. So what about the Mohawk’s claimed international trade rights? It turned out they didn’t have the evidence to back up that actually occurred and was an integral part of their pre-contact culture: para. 60.\n\nThese cases talk about “Crown sovereignty”. That means, bluntly, ‘there can only be one boss’. When English law governed Canada that meant the ‘country-like’ functions of aboriginal people like law-making, running courts, waging war - all those went away. They belong to the Crown, and that is that.\n\nBut, as you remind us, this is not just a one-way street. When the Crown took over those rights it gained an obligation identified in Mitchell v. M.N.R. “... to treat aboriginal peoples fairly and honourably, and to protect them from exploitation”. We’ll talk about that fiduciary duty later.\n\nSo, this answers your argument that aboriginal people can just set up their own governments - they lost those rights in return for Crown protection. Further, many of the things you mentioned have clearly been extinguished by legislation. Aboriginal groups have no right to set up their own police forces because any right to that was “extinguished” by the Criminal Code and legislation that authorized police forces. The same goes for courts - the only right to organize courts is found in the The Constitution Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Vict, c 3 (http://canlii.ca/t/8q7k), ss. 91-92. And the same goes for “Militia, Military and Naval Service, and Defence.”: s. 91.\n\nOh, and if an aboriginal group were to somehow set up a court? Again, the inherent jurisdiction of the Canadian superior courts would mean the inherent jurisdiction courts would have the right (and duty) to review and reject any 'aboriginal court' decisions that are contrary to Canadian law. The same, by the way, goes for Indian band counsels - their decisions are currently reviewed by the Federal Court.\n\nSo let’s talk about treaties. I found a very interesting Supreme Court of Canada case, R. v. Sioui, [1990] 1 SCR 1025 (http://canlii.ca/t/1fsvg) that talks about what treaties with aboriginal people are and how they come about. And it’s a neat historical story, too! The case on its surface deals with something very different. Four Huron were arrested and convicted for cutting down trees and camping in a Quebec provincial park. They said they had a treaty right to do that. The Supreme Court agreed.\n\nNow the “treaty” the Huron identified is short so let’s look at the whole thing:\n\n    THESE are to certify that the CHIEF of the HURON tribe of Indians, having come to me in the name of His Nation, to submit to His BRITANNICK MAJESTY, and make Peace, has been received under my Protection, with his whole Tribe; and henceforth no English Officer or party is to molest, or interrupt them in returning to their Settlement at LORETTE; and they are received upon the same terms with the Canadians, being allowed the free Exercise of their Religion, their Customs, and Liberty of trading with the English: -- recommending it to the Officers commanding the Posts, to treat them kindly.\n\n    Given under my hand at Longueil, this 5th day of September, 1760.\n\n    By the Genl's Command,\n    JOHN COSNAN, JA. MURRAY.\n    Adjut. Genl.\n\nIt was signed by Brigadier General James Murray of the British army. He was the commander of the British military in what would later become Canada.\n\nThese were exciting times! Britain and France had been dueling over North America for close to a century, and for France the end was at hand. The previous year Britain had invaded Quebec, and in 1759 the climactic battle of the Plains of Abraham decided the contest. The French were defeated and the British seized the entrance to the St. Laurence river. Remaining French forces retreated to Montreal, where, surrounded, they surrendered. That ended France’s military presence in what is now Canada.\n\nSo who were these Huron, and why did Murray make this arrangement with them? They were Indian allies of the French, and with this agreement they made peace with Britain after the defeat at Quebec City.\n\nInteresting stuff - so what else does this case tell us about treaties? A lot. For one, a treaty with an aboriginal community is not an international law treaty - it is something different:\n\n    ... an Indian treaty is an agreement sui generis which is neither created nor terminated according to the rules of international law (p. 404).\n\n    ...\n\n    ... a treaty with the Indians is unique, that it is an agreement sui generis which is neither created nor terminated according to the rules of international law. ...\n\nThat quotes another Supreme Court of Canada, Simon v. The Queen, [1985] 2 SCR 387 (http://canlii.ca/t/1fv04), and I think it might be helpful to quote the whole passage, for context:\n\n    ... While it may be helpful in some instances to analogize the principles of international treaty law to Indian treaties, these principles are not determinative. An Indian treaty is unique; it is an agreement sui generis which is neither created nor terminated according to the rules of international law. R. v. White and Bob (1964), 50 D.L.R. (2d) 613 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 617 18, aff'd [1965] S.C.R. vi, 52 D.L.R. (2d) 481; Francis v. The Queen, 1956 CanLII 79 (SCC), [1956] S.C.R. 618, at p. 631; Pawis v. The Queen, reflex, [1980] 2 F.C. 18, (1979), 102 D.L.R. (3d) 602, at p. 607.\n\nA treaty with an aboriginal group is “sui generis”. Frankly, I don’t like that term, it’s latin for “of its own kind and therefore unique”. A treaty with an Indian community is not an international treaty because Indian communities are not countries, but it is a bargain:\n\n    ... a treaty is the intention to create obligations, the presence of mutually binding obligations and a certain measure of solemnity. ...\n\nA treaty created this way is a treaty under s. 88 the Indian Act - again, not an international treaty.\n\nHere there was a promise by the Huron to cease fighting, and the British to respect the religion and customs of the Huron and “treat them kindly”. However, was it “solumn” enough? The Supreme Court says it was, even though there was no providing of traditional peace treaty belts. This was negotiation in wartime, and the paperwork was good enough for all.\n\nThe court also investigates whether this right was extinguished and determines it was not.\n\nThere is something else interesting in R. v. Sioui. Freemen seem to talk a lot about “de jure” and “de facto” governments and authority. Well, the Supreme Court here makes clear that is a very foolish argument. British “de facto” authority was established by military conquest, in 1760:\n\n    In fact, the total defeat of France in Canada was very near: the Act of Capitulation of Montreal, by which the French troops stationed in Canada laid down their arms, was signed on September 8, 1760 and signalled the end of France's de facto control in Canada.\n\n“De jure” authority was established three years later, by international treaty between Britain and France:\n\n    Great Britain's de jure control of Canada took the form of the Treaty of Paris of February 10, 1763, a treaty which inter alia ensured that the \"Inhabitants of Canada\" would be free to practise the Roman Catholic religion. Some months later, the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763 organized the territories recently acquired by Great Britain and reserved two types of land for the Indians: that located outside the colony's territorial limits and the establishments authorized by the Crown inside the colony.\n\nWhere did Canada get it’s “de jure” authority? In 1867 the U.K. passed the The British North America Act, 1867 (now called the Constitution Act, 1867) and Canada was granted authority to govern itself, as a country, by the country (the U.K.) that had previously had that authority. You can think of it as one country splitting into two.\n\nSo much for all that “de facto” crap.\n\nSo, last major point. I was a little disappointed you did not look closer at the Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14 (http://canlii.ca/t/fwfft) because as I read the decision it requires Canada maintain a duty called the \"honour of the Crown\" to all aboriginal people in Canada (para. 66):\n\n    The honour of the Crown arises “from the Crown’s assertion of sovereignty over an Aboriginal people and de facto control of land and resources that were formerly in the control of that people”: Haida Nation, at para. 32. In Aboriginal law, the honour of the Crown goes back to the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which made reference to “the several Nations or Tribes of Indians, with whom We are connected, and who live under our Protection”: see Beckman v. Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation, 2010 SCC 53 (CanLII), 2010 SCC 53, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 103, at para. 42. This “Protection”, though, did not arise from a paternalistic desire to protect the Aboriginal peoples; rather, it was a recognition of their strength. Nor is the honour of the Crown a paternalistic concept. The comments of Brian Slattery with respect to fiduciary duty resonate here:\n\n        The sources of the general fiduciary duty do not lie, then, in a paternalistic concern to protect a “weaker” or “primitive” people, as has sometimes been suggested, but rather in the necessity of persuading native peoples, at a time when they still had considerable military capacities, that their rights would be better protected by reliance on the Crown than by self-help.\n\nIn this case Canada did not live up to its obligation in a bargain with the Métis. The Métis had their own community in what is now Manitoba, the Red River Settlement:\n\n    In 1869, the Red River Settlement was a vibrant community, with a free enterprise system and established judicial and civic institutions, centred on the retail stores, hotels, trading undertakings and saloons of what is now downtown Winnipeg. The Métis were the dominant demographic group in the Settlement, comprising around 85 percent of the population, and held leadership positions in business, church and government.\n\nThe Métis were prepared to defend their community and its independence (para. 26-27), but in the end Canada and the Métis came to an agreement. The Red River Settlement would join Canada as a province, Manitoba, and the Métis in return would get a large grant of land to maintain their community: paras. 30-31.\n\nThe sad remainder of this judgment discusses how that bargain was not respected by the Canadian authorities and the Métis land grants were either delayed, had ‘strings attached’, or were set up in a way that broke up the Métis community. That failure to live up to the bargain breached the honour of the Crown, and ultimately indirectly led in 1885 to an armed Métis rebellion in what is now Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada does not say what should be done to fix the breach of the honour of the Crown because the Métis and Canada did not ask for that answer, so now presumably there are going to be some very interesting negotiations in the next few years!\n\nSo I hope that is helpful and interesting. I certainly learned a lot more about aboriginal title, rights, and treaty reading these cases.\n\nI am also quite convinced that your position is absolutely incorrect, in law, in Canada.

I had gone to the court house yesterday to get a copy of my family court order, a certified true copy, and they tried  handing me a copy that I sent back to the court house that I had declined. Then the court administrator came out and stated that I couldn't have a copy because of some marks that had been put on it. So I had to wait till today to see what the judge would say about it. So anyways I stopped in today at the friendly neighbourhood court house and asked for a true copy of the family court order. The clerk is a little miffed and goes to the back and comes back out with the file. Any ways I wasn't paying much attention at first, but then I noticed her put an envelope down, and then she started comparing two documents page for page. Then she grabs a stamp and starts to stamp it and I said no, if that is going to be your certified true copy that isn't it. I want a true certified copy of the order.  Well it is a mirror copy of the original and it has not been tampered with. It is the exact same thing except it has not been tamper with. Well the original one has been tampered with or destroyed so I can't get you a copy of that but this is just as good. I said no. I want a true certified copy of the original, I can't give you that because it is damaged. I said I guess that I’m not going to get one then. I had notice that the sheriffs in the court house were acting a little weird but wasn't paying attention. So as I'm walking out of the administrative office and into the lobby, an RCMP officer says Brenda. And of course I’m so used to answering and I said yes. And of course right after that I realized again what I had done. I'm officer so and so and I have a court order to take your daughter into custody. Is she with you? I said no. Do you know where she is? I said no. Was she with you last night? I said am I under arrest? No. Well then I'm free to go then? I said bye. And walked out of the court house. He also handed me a faxed a few times copy of the ex parte order to pick the kid up, anywhere in Nova Scotia. So my next move is to go to the next town over and pick up a true certified copy of the EX PARTE ORDER FOR SECTION 29 OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT and get my handy dandy void stamp out and start stamping like a mad woman. And I should also drop copies of the ex parte order voided and with notices of mistake to the court house and community services and still debating the RCMP detachment.

The European English Law of Canada has full right and jurisdiction over all lands and Nations across Turtle Island.  I questioned that position and i ask you now what is your thoughts on whether CANADA/US has any real claim to do what they do to the land and people whom are original to these lands?? Now, please post your views only, no need to name call or what not. Also, here is a reply to my questioning, this is a so called Native from the U.S. you tell me ??\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nor the record, I am not a Canadian but as someone in the United States that is Native American, people like you make me sick. We have your type here too - the people that cling to their ancestry in order to justify doing anything they don't want on the one hand while gladly taking every benefit they can from the government on the other hand. Your ancestry - in terms of the applicability of the law - is irrelevant. It applies to everyone in Canada, even you. No amount of screaming racism is going to change that. \nAlso, just for the record, nothing is YOUR land or YOUR resources. The ownership of land and resources is determined by the conquerors, not the conquered. You don't have to like it, but it is reality. Even if we were to accept your warped version of reality, the truth is what you think of as YOUR land and YOUR natural resources was at various times owned by other tribes before your tribe took it from them. That is what people did - they form groups and take stuff from other people. Yet somehow if we lived in your fantasy version of reality I doubt you'd want to determine just who REALLY owned what you think is your land, as if we looked I'd bet you just about all of it could be traced to being won by war or some other atrocity against another tribe. You going to hand all that land and resources back to them?

CHECK OUT QUEBEC AND NO CRIMINAL CODE!!!!!!!! The police no longer have the authority to stop Quebecers. This is what the result of a decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal made this week. It could well have disastrous consequences, even anarchic, across the province.\n\nDue to an overly high level of criminal prosecution by the Queen number, the highest court in the province called it a \"querulous litigant.\" By doing so, the court stated that the Criminal Code is therefore not in compliance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe decision had the effect of a bomb in the office of the Prime Minister Marois and from the police. Immersed in an elusive legal uncertainty, the authorities now fear no longer have the legal tools to stop the criminals. Minister Marois has expressed its readiness to resort to the Act on Measures to war if the situation degenerated and that the Canadian military was now to consolidate its workforce.\n\nAfter Lola, Queen\n\nThe Montreal wealthy businessman that the media had dubbed Eric in the legal saga \"Lola against Eric\" is the cause of the bang.\n\nAccused in a case of drunk driving in 2011, attorney Eric had managed to obtain a court decision declaring the \"querulous litigant\" Queen. For Eric, it was a rather unexpected victory given the overwhelming evidence that was presented against him at trial. Indeed, in a lengthy clip of 2:57 minutes filmed by chance using a video camera forgotten on the table of a bar, it clearly saw Eric put 17 pints of Heineken (20 oz) at a impressive rate.\n\nAlso in the field of vision of the camera, we then saw Eric get up from his chair and heading to his shiny Porsche 911. Having joined his vehicle not without effort, he started up a whirlwind backwards through the wall of the bar, stopping a few meters from the camera that was nothing missing from the scene. Moreover, the final plan, we could see very clearly the plate of the vehicle (registered in the name of Eric), which gave evidence for the prosecution, already concrete, reliability bordering on arrogance.\n\nThe police had finally put the collar the suspect a few minutes later when it was unloaded from a damaged vehicle, sat in the same chair he had left and ordered another pint of Heineken in the mid-horrified eyes, half-amused the few remaining customers.\n\nFunny fact, the well-known director Podz, which was the unfortunate owner of the camera forgotten on the table in the bar, failed to recover what had now become an exhibit.\n\nA surreal debate\n\nFollowing the viewing of the video in full hearing, Eric lawyer told the judge he would try something \"a bit special legal sense\" since his client had no defense, having consumed Heineken and not windshield washer fluid. He then asked what is declared \"querulous litigant\" Queen, or that is theoretically responsible for all criminal prosecutions in Canada.\n\nHis argument was based primarily on the fact that a person can not multiply as broad and abusive judicial proceedings so that the courts do not intervene.\n\nEric's lawyer was then referred to the case of Mario Small, a man from Saguenay having filed 14 legal remedies in the space of nine months. Its right to take legal action was then suspended in the early 2000s as had been declared vexatious litigant. By comparison, during the same time period, the Queen had filed 17,891 criminal prosecutions across Canada.\n\nFaced with these statistics, the court could not do otherwise than to suffer the same fate to the Queen that he had reserved at the time Mario Small. Indeed, all must be considered equal before the law.\n\nIn a 24-page unanimous judgment, the Court of Appeal of Quebec recalls that due to its recent decision to reject the argument Lise Thibault to the effect that the Queen could not continue itself, the Court had Now keep the same logic in treating the Queen as any other individual. It therefore had no right to take the course more than 20,000 lawsuits in a single year.\n\nWishing to remain anonymous for obvious reasons, one of the judges of the Court of Appeal awarded:\n\n\"We acquitted Eric, if we were obliged to pay Lise Thibault. We did not want to pay Thibault, the decision seemed so obvious. It was not made on the spot as it made the Criminal Code unconstitutional and that it prevented the same time the State to prosecute criminals. We learned like everyone else, listening to the chief of police to complain to the issue of Denis Lévesque. This, it was dropped, it's true. \" "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_536185806417356","body":"news tidbit....Sometime early last year, I signed a government document Director for: Robert Cormier.

Wrote them a number of letters. In the end, I was given services and my claim was back dated. More recently, I was asked to sign a government document to obtain services once again. I asked the gov worker what would happen if I didn't sign it. She said I wouldn't be given services. I told her that I didn't agree with the offered contract and that there was no \"meeting of minds\". She essentially said take it or leave it. I told her I'd sign it, which I did, and handed the document back to her. She looked at it and said \"What's this?\". She was referring to the fact that I signed it UNDER STRESS AND DURESS, followed by my signature. She said that she couldn't accept it like that and would need to speak to her supervisor.  She came back and said that her supervisor would need to take it up the chain of command. Anyways, when asked why I signed it like that, I took the document from her, put an asterisk beside my name. At the bottom of the page I put another asterisk and wrote; \"It is my understanding that I will not be given access to my trust of which I and all Canadians are beneficiaries unless I sign a contract which I don't agree with. As I need these services for my well being I signed it as indicated above.\" Several days passed. Finally, I was called and told that I would receive all benefits.

They're from Ontario, so we know who this updated version is directed at...\n\n\" Canadian post-punk outfit Alexisonfire (pronounced “Alexis-on-fire”) put out a 7-inch vinyl single with two cover tracks: “The Dead Heart” and “I'm Stranded” (originally done by a band called The Saints). Over the weekend, though, when I first heard their version of “The Dead Heart,” I was driving and not paying close attention. So I thought it was the Midnight Oil original. “The Dead Heart” starts with the same forceful lead guitar, propulsive drumming and group-chorus sung “Doo dot doo dot doo doo doo,” but then lead singer/punk screamer George Pettit comes in with an almost terrifying shouted cry from the heart when he sings: “We don't serve your country/Don't serve your king/know your custom don't speak your tongue/White man came took everyone.” It made me pull over and listen. This was not the version I knew (it's played much faster too). Midnight Oil's version was angry; Alexisonfire is filled with hate, contempt and venom. There is no doubting here what this song is about. The music is still pretty and you can still dance to it, but you cannot avoid the intent of the lyrics. Pettit spits them in your face and forces you to listen. The chorus, “We carry in our hearts the true country/and that cannot be stolen/follow in the steps of our ancestry/and that cannot be broken,” is sung by guitarist/pianist Dallas Green in a more melodic fashion. It ends up being perfect counterpoint to Pettit's full-bore venom.Alexisonfire lead singer George PettitThe fact that Alexisonfire is a St. Catharines, Ontario, band, and all-white, is astounding. When they sing this version, you forget that Midnight Oil was singing strictly about Australian aborigines because Alexisonfire version is done for all repressed people: be they Native North Americans, African slaves or indigenous peoples of Australia or New Zealand.The song is important because it details what our ancestors did to the native cultures of the many lands they colonized. There are many things my ancestors did that I would probably not be proud of. However, I live my life in a way that obviates that way of thinking. A song like this should be heard and understood, so we know what happened. But if we are to carry forward in this world, the hatred must end. Alexisonfire's version suggests the anger is still there, yet by understanding that anger, it is a starting point for reconciliation.\" Alexisonfire - Dead Hearts (Midnight Oil Cover, New 2010) www.youtube.com Off the Australian Tour 7 inch EP.

Learning about Treaties in tar sands territory\n\nEmma Pullman is writing stories from impacted communities on the front lines of the tar sands in the lead up to the 4th Annual Healing Walk, a spiritual gathering and 14 km walk to pray for the healing of the land and people at the front lines of tar sands expansion. The Healing Walk is July 5-6, 2013 in Fort McMurray, Alberta.\n\nWhile many Canadians are celebrating the 146th anniversary of this country, I don’t much feel like celebrating today. Right now, I am at the Beaver Lake Cree Nation, a community whose traditional territory is on both the Athabasca and Cold Lake tar sands projects.\n\nIt’s hard to take part in the festivities when you understand the colonialism, genocide, theft of land and resources and broken treaties that are part of the history of this country.\n\nAthabasca Chipewyan First Nation activist and educator Susana Deranger wrote in Briarpatch magazine:\n\n    “This Canada Day, I reach out to you all and appeal to your consciousness and ask you to reflect on what you are celebrating. I ask you to reflect on what this day means to Indigenous Peoples on the territory you are living on that has given you so much.\n\n    \"I ask you to dig deep inside of yourself and think about how we can work together to rectify the colonial legacy of Canada. I ask you to walk with me and others to truly create a place that is worth celebrating. I ask you to stand up to create a Canada that acknowledges the wrongs of yesterday and today, and paves the way for dignity and respect for all peoples tomorrow and all the tomorrows that follow.”\n\nMy own reflection of her words has led me to think about treaty rights, and how few Canadians understand the treaties or what it means to be Treaty Peoples. So today, I sat down with Tantoo Cardinal, Crystal Lameman, Maria Laboucan-Massimo and Melina Laboucan-Massimo, all members of Treaty 6 and Treaty 8 territory. And I did what feels like the most patriotic thing I’ve ever done on Canada Day -- I learned about Treaty 6 and Treaty 8, the treaties of the lands most impacted by the tar sands.\n\n10 THINGS CANADIANS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE TREATIES UPON WHICH THE TAR SANDS ARE BEING DEVELOPED\n\n1.  If you are a Canadian, know you are a signatory to a Treaty. If you are a settler (i.e. non-Indigenous), know you are a benefactor of the Treaty. \n\n2.   Read the Treaty.\nKnow which Treaty territory you are on.\nYou can read Treaty 6 and Treaty 8, the two treaty territories that sit in the tar sands. \n\n3.  Know that the Treaty its not just an Indigenous peoples agreement.\nWe are all Treaty peoples.\nKnow that treaties are the foundation of Canada. \n\n4.  The Treaty is a reciprocal treaty, an equal treaty for co-existence.\nIt was an agreement between the British Crown and Indigenous peoples.\nFirst Nations leaders believed they were entering into a trust relationship with the representative of the British Crown.\nThey considered the Treaty a mutual trust agreement to live in peace.\n\n5.  Non-native people are benefactors of those treaties because they are receiving the benefits and profits of the resources from native land.\nThere are billions of dollars coming out of traditional territories, and it never stays in the territory.\nThese real costs of resource extraction, in turn, are borne by the people and communities who have lived here all along. \n\n6.  First Nations never violated the treaty.\n\n7.  First Nations have never surrendered their land. \n\n8.  The federal government has a fiduciary responsibility with First Nations who entered into Treaty.\nIn plain terms, it's similar to the responsibility that a corporation has to its shareholders.\nThe Canadian government’s shareholders are First Nations and it has a duty, a legal responsibility to them. \n\n9.  When reading the Treaty, you’ll never come across the word “ownership”, because no one can own the land.\nThe land owns its inhabitants. \n\n10.  According to the Treaty, as long as the grass grows, the rivers flow and the sun shines, First Nations will always have a right to the land to hunt and fish and forage.\nAs long as industrial development continues to take place on these lands without consent, these Constitutional rights are being violated.\n\n“It says in the Treaty that we will SHARE THIS LAND WITH YOU TO THE DEPTH OF A PLOUGH,” Crystal said to me. \n\nSenator Allan Bird, Montreal Lake Cree Nation, is directly quoted on Treaty 6: “the government said that we would live together, that I am not here to take away what you have now…I AM HERE TO BORROW THE LAND…TO THE DEPTH OF A PLOUGH…that is how much I want.”\n\nThat’s why ACCORDING TO TREATY LAW, ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THE GROUND THAT CREATES REVENUE BELONGS TO FIRST NATIONS.\n\nCrystal adds, “AS PER THE TREATY, ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THE TERRITORY is supposed to go to those people. The federal government has a fiduciary responsibility with the First Nations who entered into Treaty.”\n\nBut for Maria Laboucan-Massimo, THE LUBICON TERRITORY WHERE SHE IS FROM HAS SEEN $14 BILLION IN RESOURCE DOLLARS LEAVE HER TERRITORY.\nThat money goes to federal government, and into a kind of bank.\nWhile the rest of the country uses this money, HER COMMUNITY DOESN’T SEE MUCH OF IT.\n\n CFNE - Cultural Foundation Native Expressions - How to Steal from the Indians - On the Art of... cfne.org How to Steal from the Indians - On the Art of Stealing Human Rights, extracts from the speech delivered by Gerry Gambill in 1958 at a Human Rights conference, Tobique Reserve (1958) | November 23 2011 "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_535628606473076","body":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyd_NldNSiM&feature=player_embedded#at=110 Police Beat Man To Death As He Begged For His Life, Detained Witnesses, Seized Videos youtube.com BAKERSFIELD, CA -- Kern County deputies beat an intoxicated man to death in the street Tuesday night, then detained and intimidated witnesses, confiscated vi...

The person who worked with me was going to college and working over the summer. Because my old phone had died and was a dinosaur (I wanted it to be non GPS on purpose), he presumed to think I was of course, useless.\n\nSo I decided to ask him some questions. Do you know about the FED and what it is. He replied, of course, it's a part of the US government and is regulated. I said really? Then asked, and how about the $40 billion the FED is printing every month ....it's now called Q3? He said, the FED is regulated that when any new money is printed, the old money must be destroyed. Final question was about 9/11. When I asked if he believed the government's version of it and some other important facts, he said....oh yeah, ha ha .....you're one of those conspiracy theorist.\n\nObviously this young man is still stuck in the matrix as he smirked at my much older than his face.\n\nThen he had the balls to ask me if I ever attended college (like that means anything while he's paying for his education using loans that have doubled in interest ...so he'll be a debt slave once he graduates and will spend his entire life paying it back). I replied by saying, does that really matter? But, just for your information, I do have a BA in psychology (and my final payment on my loan ended when I was 31) .... and I went on to get my masters later in life until I realized it wouldn't be worth it, and I quit after 2 semesters.\n\nBut don't worry, because he KNOWS he is going make a lotta money once he graduates college.

Those holding Federal or State public office, county or municipal office, under the Legislative, Executive or Judicial branch, including Court Officials, Judges, Prosecutors, Law Enforcement Department employees, Officers of the Court, and etc., before entering into these public offices, are required by the U.S. Constitution and statutory law to comply with Title 5 USC, Sec. §3331, \"Oath of office.\" State Officials are also required to meet this same obligation, according to State Constitutions and State statutory law.\n\n2. All oaths of office come under 22 CFR, Foreign Relations, Sections §§92.12 -92.30, and all who hold public office come under Title 8 USC, Section §1481 \"Loss of nationality by native-born or naturalized citizen; voluntary action; burden of proof; presumptions.\"\n\n3. Under Title 22 USC, Foreign Relations and Intercourse, Section §611, a Public Official is considered a foreign agent. In order to hold public office, the candidate must file a true and complete registration statement with the State Attorney General as a foreign principle.\n\n4. The Oath of Office requires the public official in his / her foreign state capacity to uphold the constitutional form of government or face consequences.\n\nTitle 10 USC, Sec. §333, \"Interference with State and Federal law\"\n\nThe President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy, if it—\n\n(1) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the United States within the State, that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right, privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or (2) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\n\nIn any situation covered by clause (1), the State shall be considered to have denied the equal protection of the laws secured by the Constitution.\n\n5. Such willful action, while serving in official capacity, violates Title 18 USC, Section §1918:\n\nTitle 18 USC, Section §1918 \"Disloyalty and asserting the right to strike against the government\"\n\nWhoever violates the provision of 7311 of title 5 that an individual may not accept or hold a position in the Government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia if he—\n\n(1) advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of government; (2) is a member of an organization that he knows advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of government;\n\nshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year and a day, or both.\n\nand also deprives claimants of \"honest services:\n\nTitle 18, Section §1346. Definition of \"scheme or artifice to defraud\"\n\n\"For the purposes of this chapter, the term \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\n\nISSUE TWO: JUDGE SERVES AS A DEBT COLLECTOR\n\n6. Judges hold public office under Title 28 USC, Chapter 176, Federal Debt Collection Procedure:\n\nTitle 28, Chapter 176, Federal Debt Collection Procedure, Section §3002\n\nAs used in this chapter:\n\n(2) \"Court\" means any court created by the Congress of the United States, excluding the United States Tax Court. (3) \"Debt\" means—\n\n(A) an amount that is owing to the United States on account of a direct loan, or loan insured or guaranteed, by the United States; or (B) an amount that is owing to the United States on account of a fee, duty, lease, rent, service, sale of real or personal property, overpayment, fine, assessment, penalty, restitution, damages, interest, tax, bail bond forfeiture, reimbursement, recovery of a cost incurred by the United States, or other source of indebtedness to the United States, but that is not owing under the terms of a contract originally entered into by only persons other than the United States;\n\n(8) \"Judgment\" means a judgment, order, or decree entered in favor of the United States in a court and arising from a civil or criminal proceeding regarding a debt. (15) \"United States\" means—\n\n(A) a Federal corporation; (B) an agency, department, commission, board, or other entity of the United States; or (C) an instrumentality of the United States.\n\nTitle 22 USC, Sec. §286. \"Acceptance of membership by United States in International Monetary Fund,\" states the following:\n\nThe President is hereby authorized to accept membership for the United States in the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as the \"Fund\"), and in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (hereinafter referred to as the \"Bank\"), provided for by the Articles of Agreement of the Fund and the Articles of Agreement of the Bank as set forth in the Final Act of the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference dated July 22, 1944, and deposited in the archives of the Department of State.\n\n8. Title 22 USC, Sec. § 286e-13, \"Approval of fund pledge to sell gold to provide resources for Reserve Account of Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Trust,\" states the following:\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to instruct the Fund's pledge to sell, if needed, up to 3,000,000 ounces of the Fund's gold, to restore the resources of the Reserve Account of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Trust to a level that would be sufficient to meet obligations of the Trust payable to lenders which have made loans to the Loan Account of the Trust that have been used for the purpose of financing programs to Fund members previously in arrears to the Fund.\n\nISSUE THREE: NO IMMUNITY UNDER \"COMMERCE\"\n\n9. All immunity of the United States, and all liability of States, instrumentalities of States, and State officials have been waived under commerce, according to the following US Codes:\n\nTitle 15 USC, Commerce, Sec. §1122, \"Liability of States, instrumentalities of States, and State officials\"\n\n(a) Waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States. The United States, all agencies and instrumentalities thereof, and all individuals, firms, corporations, other persons acting for the United States and with the authorization and consent of the United States, shall not be immune from suit in Federal or State court by any person, including any governmental or nongovernmental entity, for any violation under this Act. (b) Waiver of sovereign immunity by States. Any State, instrumentality of a State or any officer or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his or her official capacity, shall not be immune, under the eleventh amendment of the Constitution of the United States or under any other doctrine of sovereign immunity, from suit in Federal court by any person, including any governmental or nongovernmental entity for any violation under this Act.\n\nTitle 42 USC, Sec. §12202, \"State immunity\"\n\nA State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter. In any action against a State for a violation of the requirements of this chapter, remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in an action against any public or private entity other than a State\n\nTitle 42 USC, Sec. §2000d–7, \"Civil rights remedies equalization\"\n\n(a) General provision\n\n(1) A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 794], title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.], the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 [42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.], title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.], or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance. (2) In a suit against a State for a violation of a statute referred to in paragraph (1), remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) are available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State.\n\n10. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 gives immunity in Administrative Court to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) only when an action is brought by the people against a public, agency or corporate official /department. Under Title 5 USC, Commerce, public offices or officials can be sanctioned.\n\nTitle 5, USC, Sec. §551:\n\n(10) \"sanction\" includes the whole or a part of an agency—\n\n(A) prohibition, requirement, limitation, or other condition affecting the freedom of a person;(B) withholding of relief;(C) imposition of penalty or fine;(D) destruction, taking, seizure, or withholding of property;(E) assessment of damages, reimbursement, restitution, compensation, costs, charges, or fees;(F) requirement, revocation, or suspension of a license; or\n\n(G) taking other compulsory or restrictive action;\n\n11. Justice is required to be BLIND while holding a SET OF SCALES and a TWO-EDGED SWORD. This symbolizes true justice. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (60 stat 237) would allow the sword to cut in either direction and give the judge immunity by holding his own court office accountable for honest service fraud, obstruction of justice, false statements, malicious prosecution and fraud placed upon the court. Any willful intent to uncover the EYES OF JUSTICE or TILT THE SCALES is a willful intent to deny Due Process, which violates Title 18 USC §1346, \"Scheme or Artifice to Defraud,\" by perpetrating a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services. This is considered fraud and an overthrow of a constitutional form of government and the person depriving the honest service can be held accountable and face punishment under Title 18 USC and Title 42 USC and violates Title 28 USC judicial procedures.\n\n12. Both Title 18 USC, Crime and Criminal Procedure, and Title 42 USC, Public Health and Welfare, allow the Petitioner to bring an action against the United States and/or the State agencies, departments, and employees for civil rights violations while dealing in commerce. Title 10 places all public officials under this Title10 section 333 while under a state of emergency. (Declare or undeclared War this fall under TWEA.)\n\nISSUE FOUR:\n\nCOURTS OPERATING UNDER WAR POWERS ACT\n\n13. The Courts are operating under the Emergency War Powers Act. The country has been under a declared \"state of emergency\" for the past 70 years resulting in the Constitution being suspended (See Title 50 USC Appendix – Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917). The Courts have been misusing Title 50 USC, Sec. §23, \"Jurisdiction of United States courts and judges,\" which provides for criminal jurisdiction over an \"enemy of the state,\" whereas, Petitioner comes under Title 50 USC Appendix Application Sec. §21, \"Claims of naturalized citizens as affected by expatriation\" which states the following:\n\nThe claim of any naturalized American citizen under the provisions of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] shall not be denied on the ground of any presumption of expatriation which has arisen against him, under the second sentence of section 2 of the Act entitled \"An Act in reference to the expatriation of citizens and their protection abroad,\" approved March 2, 1907, if he shall give satisfactory evidence to the President, or the court, as the case may be, of his uninterrupted loyalty to the United States during his absence, and that he has returned to the United States, or that he, although desiring to return, has been prevented from so returning by circumstances beyond his control.\n\n14. 15 Statutes at Large, Chapter 249 (section 1), enacted July 27 1868, states the following:\n\nPREAMBLE - Rights of American citizens in foreign states.\n\nWHEREAS the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and whereas in the recognition of this principle this government has freely received emigrants from all nations, and invested them with the rights of citizenship; and whereas it is claimed that such American citizens, with their descendants, are subjects of foreign states, owing allegiance to the governments thereof; and whereas it is necessary to the maintenance of public peace that this claim of foreign allegiance should be promptly and finally disavowed.\n\nSECTION I - Right of expatriation declared.\n\nTHEREFORE, Be it enacted by the Senate of the and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That any declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officers of this government which denies, restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation, is hereby declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this government.\n\nSECTION II - Protection to naturalized citizens in foreign states.\n\nAnd it is further enacted, That all naturalized citizens of the United States, while in foreign states, shall be entitled to, and shall receive from this government, the same protection of persons and property that is accorded to native born citizens in like situations and circumstances. SECTION III - Release of citizens imprisoned by foreign governments to be demanded.\n\nAnd it is further enacted, That whenever it shall be made known to the President that any citizen of the United States has been unjustly deprived of his liberty by or under the authority of any foreign government, it shall be the duty of the President forthwith to demand of that government the reasons for such imprisonment, and if it appears to be wrongful and in the violation of the rights of American citizenship, the President shall forthwith demand the release of such citizen, and if the release so demanded is unreasonably delayed or refused, it shall be the duty of the President to use such means, not amounting to acts of war, as he may think necessary and proper to obtain or effectuate such release, and all the facts and proceedings relative thereto shall as soon as practicable be communicated by the President to Congress.\n\nApproved, July 27, 1868\n\n15. The Courts and the States are enforcing the following code on American nationals: Title 50 USC Appendix App, Trading, Act, Sec. §4, \"Licenses to enemy or ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance companies; change of name; doing business in United States,\" as a result of the passage of The Amendatory Act of March 9, 1933 to Title 50 USC, Trading with the Enemy Act Public Law No. 65-91 (40 Stat. L. 411) October 6, 1917. The original Trading with the Enemy Act excluded the people of the United States from being classified as the enemy when involved in transactions wholly within the United States. The Amendatory Act of March 9, 1933, however, included the people of the United States as the enemy, by incorporating the following language into the Trading With The Enemy Act: \"by any person within the United States.\" The abuses perpetrated upon the American people are the result of Title 50 USC, Trading With The Enemy Act, which turned the American people into \"enemy of the state.\" "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_535351743167429","body":"Here is a possible alternative for JUSTICE method.\n\nhttp://creditreports.dnb.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/IballValidationCmd?storeId=11154&catalogId=71154&searchType=BSF&busName=JUSTICE&state&country=CA&cm_mmc=dnb-_-home-_-retail-_-lookup_-topbar#goTop\n\nOntario Justice Of The Peace \n89 James St, Parry Sound, ON, CA\n\nhttp://centraleastontario.cioc.ca/record/PSD0094\n\nthe address when you look it up....

I will turn all of you loose on a population who does not grasp the exponential function.”\n\nIn end, I do not see anything the same anymore. I drive to work and look at everyone, busy trotting along, following every belief they have been presented, wondering if any one of them has any clue what they are doing. \n\nBut what I do know is they will all get sick of this eventually.

The most important lesson we can learn is about human rights and equality. The fact that in Canada if you get hurt on the job and accept workers compensation insurance from any province means two things. Firstly you are promised at least 75% of wage loss and in many cases up to 100% and medical care will be provided for injuries. BUT! and this is where the crimes start, if you accept their offer legislation is in place to remove Canadians from the Canada health act and also remove a Canadians legal rights through Workers Compensation Acts. They don't tell you this when injured or before. Unfortunately there are hundreds if not thousands of Canadians murdered every year by the criminal activity of all Workers Compensation Boards and the corporations that cripple them. The blame lies squarely on governments shoulders for not protecting the working men and women of this country. In fact there are tens of thousands right now in Canada not being treated for Chronic Pain. As a result many commit suicide or die of stress from pain causing heart attacks, strokes, and ulcers. To ad to the trauma of the injured workers we are subjected to needless pointless psychologically abusive appeals process. Bottom line is this. If you get injured on the job in Canada you have absolutely no protection from criminal activity if you accept workers comp. Our governments are guilty of neglect and it is costing us our lives after injury. We can't get well, can't get back to work, because our medical care and wage loss benefits do not exist.. The whole system is a fraud leading to murder of patients.

In consideration of the loan you promised to repay the principal amount along with interest at the agreed rate and you executed a mortgage deed in favour of SSSSSSSSS that authorised them to register a first legal charge against the property known as (property), by way of security for its loan.\nThe mortgage deed is made out in accordance with s.52 of the Law of Property Act 1925.\n\nAs your letter explains, you repaid the loan in full on or around August 2003, discharging your liability with SSSSSSSSS, who then released its security for the loan by removing its charge against the property, at which point the relationship came to an end.\n\nIn light of the above, the position adopted in your letter dated 24 June 2013 appears ill conceived and misguided.\n  \nIf you should remain of the view that you have a claim against SSSSSSSSSS, then no doubt you will make such application to the courts as you deem appropriate.  However, before taking such a step, we would strongly urge you to take independent legal advice.\n\nFinally, for the avoidance of any doubt, SSSSSSSS considers its position is clear an unequivocally set out in this letter and will not enter into any further correspondence with you about this matter,\n\nYours faithfully,\n(name of legal firm)\n\nMy draft response (not sent as yet) \n\n8 July 2013\n\nDear (lawyer),\nRe: Your Ref: \n\nThank you for your letter dated 4 July 2013, however there appears to be a misunderstanding.\n\nTo put it bluntly, I am confused.  Who are you referring to as ‘you’?\n\nThe ‘you’ that you are referring to appears to refer to an entity known as the ‘customer’.  I am not communicating with you, or ‘SSSSSS’ in the capacity of a customer or former customer.  The ‘you’ you are referring to is not me, nor am I to be addressed as ‘Mr’ as it is not a title that pertains to me.\n\nI wrote to ‘SSSSSSSS’ in relation to the deposit of a valuable security with them, that coincided on or about the time of them creating a customer account (number AAAAAAAAAAA).  In this instance, you will notice that I am acting in the capacity of a creditor who made an irregular deposit by way of a bill of exchange (hereinafter ‘valuable security’).\n\nThe irregular deposit of the valuable security was accepted and or deposited by ‘SSSSSS’ and coincided on or about the time of the creation of the customer account (number AAAAAAAAAAA) as mentioned in my correspondence dated 24 June 2013.\n \nIf you re-read the letter accompanying the invoice, it will become very clear.  The primary reason for my referring to the account number was to give ‘SSSSSSS’ a reference point for locating the funds that were deposited with them by me on or about 30 July 2001.\n\nSo, any reference by either you or ‘SSSSSS’ regarding customer dealings bear no relation to me and are of no consequence.  I merely wish to withdraw the funds that were deposited by way of valuable security for the sum of £XXXXX with ‘SSSSSS’ on or about 30 July 2001.  \n\nI have provided sufficient details for ‘SSSSSS’ to be able to locate the details of my irregular deposit and return these funds to me as directed and I will be dealing with this matter in the manner as set out in my correspondence dated 24 June 2013. \n \nI am willing to swear an affidavit to the facts, and, if ‘SSSSSS’ wishes to acquiesce through their silence by not entering into any further correspondence as mentioned in your letter, then there will be no controversy that any court needs to address as there will be agreement between the parties.\nI trust that this clarifies matters for you,\n\nStuart Stone, Authorised Representative\nNon Assumpsit, All Rights Reserved\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_533446486691288","body":"End of the week funny...

who may incline to Trade with the said Indians do take out a Licence for carrying on such Trade from the Governor or Commander in Chief of any of our Colonies respectively where such Person shall reside, and also give Security to observe such Regulations as We shall at any Time think fit, by ourselves or by our Commissaries to be appointed for this Purpose, to direct and appoint for the Benefit of the said Trade:\n\nAnd we do hereby authorize, enjoin, and require the Governors and Commanders in Chief of all our Colonies respectively, as well those under Our immediate Government as those under the Government and Direction of Proprietaries, to grant such Licences without Fee or Reward, taking especial Care to insert therein a Condition, that such Licence shall be void, and the Security forfeited in case the Person to whom the same is granted shall refuse or neglect to observe such Regulations as We shall think proper to prescribe as aforesaid.\n\nAnd we do further expressly conjoin and require all Officers whatever, as well Military as those Employed in the Management and Direction of Indian Affairs, within the Territories reserved as aforesaid for the use of the said Indians, to seize and apprehend all Persons whatever, who standing charged with Treason, Misprisions of Treason, Murders, or other Felonies or Misdemeanors, shall fly from Justice and take Refuge in the said Territory, and to send them under a proper guard to the Colony where the Crime was committed, of which they stand accused, in order to take their Trial for the same.\n\nGiven at our Court at

Although there is vast cultural variation between First Nations, most groups maintained similar beliefs and principles that governed their relationship with and responsibility to the land.\n\nMost First Nations did not believe that pieces of land could or should be owned by individuals—humans, along with all other living beings, belonged to the land. The land provided for humans, and in turn, humans bore a responsibility to respect and care for it. Many Aboriginal peoples understand this as a reciprocal relationship with the land.\n\nEUROPEAN SETTLERS ARRIVING IN NORTH AMERICA BROUGHT WITH THEM CONCEPTS OF PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERSHIP, AND THE NOTION THAT HUMANS COULD, AND SHOULD, OWN LAND AS A STEP TOWARDS “CIVILIZATION.” \n\nIn 1763 the British Crown issued The Royal Proclamation, a document that recognized Aboriginal title during European settlement of what is now Canada. The Proclamation states that ownership over North America is issued to King George III, but that ABORIGINAL TITLE EXISTS AND CAN ONLY BE EXTINGUISHED BY TREATY WITH THE CROWN.\n\nThe Proclamation further specifies that Aboriginal land can only be sold or ceded to the Crown, and not directly to settlers. \n\n Aboriginal Title indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca Aboriginal title refers to the inherent Aboriginal right to land or a territory.

Co. vs. Chaput, 60 A.2d 118, 120; 95 NH 200.\n\nWhile the distinction is made clear between the two as the courts have stated:\n\"A motor vehicle or automobile for hire is a motor vehicle, other than an automobile stage, used for the transportation of persons for which remuneration is received.\" International Motor Transit Co. vs. Seattle, 251 P. 120.\n\nThe term 'motor vehicle' is different and broader than the word automobile.'\"; City of Dayton vs. DeBrosse, 23 NE.2d 647, 650; 62 Ohio App. 232.\n\nThe distinction is made very clear in Title 18 USC 31:\n\n\"MOTOR VEHICLE\" means every description or other contrivance propelled or drawn by mechanical power and used for commercial purposes on the highways in the transportation of passengers, or passengers and property.\n\"USED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES\" means the carriage of persons or property for any fare, fee, rate, charge or other considerations, or directly or indirectly in connection with any business, or other undertaking intended for profit.\n\n    Clearly, an automobile is private property in use for private purposes, while a motor vehicle is a machine which may be used upon the highways for trade, commerce, or hire.\n\n    TRAVEL\n    The term \"travel\" is a significant term and is defined as:\n\n    \"The term 'travel' and 'traveler' are usually construed in their broad and general sense...so as to include all those who rightfully use the highways viatically (when being reimbursed for expenses) and who have occasion to pass over them for the purpose of business, convenience, or pleasure.\" [emphasis added] 25 Am.Jur. (1st) Highways, Sect.427, p.717.\n    \"Traveler: One who passes from place to place, whether for pleasure, instruction, business, or health.\" Locket vs. State, 47 Ala. 45; Bovier's Law Dictionary, 1914 ed., p. 3309.\n\n    \"Travel: To journey or to pass through or over; as a country district, road, etc. To go from one place to another, whether on foot, or horseback, or in any conveyance as a train, an automobile, carriage, ship, or aircraft; Make a journey.\" Century Dictionary, p.2034.\n\n    Therefore, the term \"travel\" or \"traveler\" refers to one who uses a conveyance to go from one place to another, and included all those who use the highways as a matter of Right.\n\n    otice that in all these definitions the phrase \"for hire\" never occurs. This term \"travel\" or \"traveler\" implies, by definition, one who uses the road as a means to move from one place to another.\n\n    Therefore, one who uses the road in the ordinary course of life and business for the purpose of travel and transportation is a traveler.\n\n    DRIVER\n    The term \"driver\" in contradistinction to \"traveler\" is defined as:\n\n    \"Driver: One employed in conducting a coach, carriage, wagon, or other vehicle...\" Bovier's Law Dictionary, 1914 ed., p. 940.\n    Notice that this definition includes one who is \"employed\" in conducting a vehicle. It should be self-evident that this person could not be \"travelling\" on a journey, but is using the road as a place of business.\n\n    OPERATOR\n    Today we assume that a \"traveler\" is a \"driver,\" and a \"driver\" is an \"operator.\" However, this is not the case.\n\n    \"It will be observed from the language of the ordinance that a distinction is to be drawn between the terms 'operator' and 'driver'; the 'operator' of the service car being the person who is licensed to have the car on the streets in the business of carrying passengers for hire; while the 'driver' is the one who actually drives the car. However, in the actual prosecution of business, it was possible for the same person to be both 'operator' and 'driver.'\" Newbill vs. Union Indemnity Co., 60 SE.2d 658.\n    To further clarify the definition of an \"operator\" the court observed that this was a vehicle \"for hire\" and that it was in the business of carrying passengers.\n\n    This definition would seem to describe a person who is using the road as a place of business, or in other words, a person engaged in the \"privilege\" of using the road for gain.\n\n    This definition, then, is a further clarification of the distinction mentioned earlier, and therefore:\n\n    Travelling upon and transporting one's property upon the public roads as a matter of Right meets the definition of a traveler.\n\n    Using the road as a place of business as a matter of privilege meets the definition of a driver or an operator or both.\n\n    TRAFFIC\n    Having defined the terms \"automobile,\" \"motor vehicle,\" \"traveler,\" \"driver,\" and \"operator,\" the next term to define is \"traffic\":\n\n    \"...Traffic thereon is to some extent destructive, therefore, the prevention of unnecessary duplication of auto transportation service will lengthen the life of the highways or reduce the cost of maintenance, the revenue derived by the state...will also tend toward the public welfare by producing at the expense of those operating for private gain, some small part of the cost of repairing the wear...\" Northern Pacific R.R. Co. vs. Schoenfeldt, 213 P. 26.\n    Note: In the above, Justice Tolman expounded upon the key of raising revenue by taxing the \"privilege\" to use the public roads \"at the expense of those operating for gain.\"\n\n    In this case, the word \"traffic\" is used in conjunction with the unnecessary Auto Transportation Service, or in other words, \"vehicles for hire.\" The word \"traffic\" is another word which is to be strictly construed to the conducting of business.\n\n    \"Traffic: Commerce, trade, sale or exchange of merchandise, bills, money, or the like. The passing of goods and commodities from one person to another for an equivalent in goods or money...\"; Bovier's Law Dictionary, 1914 ed., p. 3307.\n    Here again, notice that this definition refers to one \"conducting business.\" No mention is made of one who is travelling in his automobile. This definition is of one who is engaged in the passing of a commodity or goods in exchange for money, i.e.., vehicles for hire.\n\n    Furthermore, the word \"traffic\" and \"travel\" must have different meanings which the courts recognize. The difference is recognized in Ex Parte Dickey, supra:\n\n    \"..in addition to this, cabs, hackney coaches, omnibuses, taxicabs, and hacks, when unnecessarily numerous, interfere with the ordinary traffic and travel and obstruct them.\"\n    The court, by using both terms, signified its recognition of a distinction between the two. But, what was the distinction? We have already defined both terms, but to clear up any doubt:\n\n    \"The word 'traffic' is manifestly used here in secondary sense, and has reference to the business of transportation rather than to its primary meaning of interchange of commodities.\" Allen vs. City of Bellingham, 163 P. 18.\n    Here the Supreme Court of the State of Washington has defined the word \"traffic\" (in either its primary or secondary sense) in reference to business, and not to mere travel! So it is clear that the term \"traffic\" is business related and therefore, it is a \"privilege.\" The net result being that \"traffic\" is brought under the (police) power of the legislature. The term has no application to one who is not using the roads as a place of business.\n\n    LICENSE\n    It seems only proper to define the word \"license,\" as the definition of this word will be extremely important in understanding the statutes as they are properly applied:\n\n    \"The permission, by competent authority to do an act which without permission, would be illegal, a trespass, or a tort.\" People vs. Henderson, 218 NW.2d 2, 4.\n    \"Leave to do a thing which licensor could prevent.\" Western Electric Co. vs. Pacent Reproducer Corp., 42 F.2d 116, 118.\n\n    In order for these two definitions to apply in this case, the state would have to take up the position that the exercise of a Constitutional Right to use the public roads in the ordinary course of life and business is illegal, a trespass, or a tort, which the state could then regulate or prevent.\n\n    This position, however, would raise magnitudinous Constitutional questions as this position would be diametrically opposed to fundamental Constitutional Law. (See \"Conversion of a Right to a Crime,\" infra.)\n\n    In the instant case, the proper definition of a \"license\" is:\n\n    \"a permit, granted by an appropriate governmental body, generally for consideration, to a person, firm, or corporation, to pursue some occupation or to carry on some business which is subject to regulation under the police power.\" [emphasis added] Rosenblatt vs. California State Board of Pharmacy, 158 P.2d 199, 203.\n    This definition would fall more in line with the \"privilege\" of carrying on business on the streets.\n\n    Most people tend to think that \"licensing\" is imposed by the state for the purpose of raising revenue, yet there may well be more subtle reasons contemplated; for when one seeks permission from someone to do something he invokes the jurisdiction of the \"licensor\" which, in this case, is the state. In essence, the licensee may well be seeking to be regulated by the \"licensor.\"\n\n    \"A license fee is a charge made primarily for regulation, with the fee to cover costs and expenses of supervision or regulation.\" State vs. Jackson, 60 Wisc.2d 700; 211 NW.2d 480, 487.\n    The fee is the price; the regulation or control of the licensee is the real aim of the legislation.\n\n    Are these licenses really used to fund legitimate government, or are they nothing more than a subtle introduction of police power into every facet of our lives? Have our \"enforcement agencies\" been diverted from crime prevention, perhaps through no fault of their own, instead now busying themselves as they \"check\" our papers to see that all are properly endorsed by the state?\n\n    How much longer will it be before we are forced to get a license for our lawn mowers, or before our wives will need a license for her \"blender\" or \"mixer?\" They all have motors on them and the state can always use the revenue.\n\n    Of course as a Signatory none of this applies any way :)\n\n------\nCapri Adirim\n\n71. http://www.apfn.org/apfn/travel.htm ~ (Drivers License vs Right to Travel)\n\n72. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqFgUZcVDfo&feature=share - (NO DRIVER LICENSE REQUIRED IN THE U.S!)\n\n73. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1B45HPp06g&feature=youtu.be ~ (The truth about drivers licenses)\n\n74. http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/DLbrief.shtml ~ (Drivers licensing vs Right to Travel) different doc from above\n\n75. http://yhvh.name/MISSION_AID/RIGHT_TO_DRIVE_NO_LICENSE.pdf\n\n76. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4u1X5yu444 ~ (ICBC and the Right to Travel)\n\n77. http://www.pauljjhansen.com/?p=474 ~ (Cop says “NOT FOR HIRE” defense is a reality. | Paul John)\n\n78. http://www.ebay.com/itm/230816967262 ~ (Not For Hire - Out Of Service License Plate Tag Frame)\n\n79. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um-rezIQ6ck ~ (Unregister your car)\n\n80. http://justpaste.it/DMVNon-disclosure ~ (The DMV Non-Disclosure When a good portion of American... - justpaste.it)\n\n81. http://www.justiceprose.8m.com/carl/carl41.html ~ (Common Law Vehicular Judicial Notice Constitutional Drivers License)\n\n82. http://ecclesia.org/truth/license.html ~ (How is a license against God's will?)\n\n83. http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/8356-ok-womans-legal-battle-real-id-drivers-license-unconstitutional\n\n84. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyzCfIJ3J4k&feature=player_embedded ~ (You are the Judge!

Utilization of stamps includes putting stamps on any documents (for clout purposes, not mailing) we wish to introduce into the system. As long as you use a stamp (of any kind) you are in the game. If you have time, resources, and the luxury of dealing with something well before expiration of a given time frame, you can use stamps that you consider ideal. The most preferable stamps are ones that are both large and contain the most colors. In an emergency situation, or simply if economy is a consideration, any stamp will do. Using a postage stamp and autograph on it makes you the postmaster for that contract.\nWhenever you put a stamp on a document, inscribe your full name over the stamp at an angle. The color ink you use for this is a function of what color will show up best against the colors in the stamp. Ideal colors for doing this are purple (royalty), blue (origin of the bond), and gold (king's edict). Avoid red at all cost. Obviously, if you have a dark, multi-colored stamp you do not want to use purple or blue ink, since your autograph on it would not stand out as well if you used lighter color ink. Ideally one could decide on the best color for his autograph and then obtain stamps that best suit one's criteria and taste. Although a dollar stamp is best, it is a luxury unless one is well off financially. Otherwise, reserve the use of dollar stamps for crucial instruments, such as travel documents.

This is a good thing. To much crap floating around just stinks. From questions raised in every OP I see commenters stray from the basics of the OP.\nThis is my method of approaching something I do not understand. Maybe others may post theirs as it may help others.\nI pick 2 points only, no matter how large the document. I have been going over the Bills of Exchange Act.\nPOINT 1 \"\"Bills of Exchange Act\"\" (The title it self speaks volumes) many long hours have been invested into those 4 words. Fantastic learning!\nPOINT 2 \"\"Section 30\"\"\nPerfecting bill\n\n30. Where a simple signature on a blank paper is delivered by the signer in order that it may be converted into a bill, it operates, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as an authority to fill it up as a complete bill for any amount, using the signature for that of the drawer or acceptor, or an endorser, and, in like manner, when a bill is wanting in any material particular, the person in possession of it has, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the authority to fill up the omission in any way he thinks fit.\n\nThe point of a method such as this is that if the above is always used when reading this act there is always a base to referance to. To help stay on track so to speak.\nI use the above 2 points since I see the Entire act as having;\n1) Everything is an Exchange of some nature and,\n2) Every thing in this act starts from Just a signature and nothing else. \nSo when ever studying portions of this act I always start with the above 2 items as a base.\n\nDoes anyone else use 'tricks' like this to help learn and what are they if you want to share.\nRipping things apart is always fun as long as you have a referance.

From this point forward and forever it is my will that the only way to create joinder between me and any legal PERSON is in writing and witnessed by a Notary Public provided with my consent.\n\nthat  “inasmuch as every government is an artificial person, an abstraction, and creature of the mind only , a government can interface only with artificial persons.  The imaginary, having neither actuality nor substance, is foreclosed from creating and attaining parity with the tangible.  The legal manifestation of this is that no government, as well as any law, agency, aspect, court, etc. can concern itself with anything other than corporate, artificial persons and the contracts between them.”\nPenhallow v Doane’s administrators, 3 U.S. 54 (1795) at p\n\nPope Pius XI wrote Divini redemptoris: \"The human being ought to be put in the first rank of earthly realities.\" Pope Pius XII wrote July 14, 1946: \"It is the human being that Yahweh put at the top of the visible universe, making him, in economics and politics as well, the measure of all things.\"\nIt is not Government who is at the top; it is the human being. The human being therefore does not belong to Government; it is rather Government that must belong to the human being, who must serve him by exercising its function of guardian of human freedoms.\nMaurice Allard, the MP for Sherbrooke, Que., also said during this debate on the Bill of Rights: \"The individual must not become a tool or a victim of the State; it is the State which, while making laws, must favour the numerous freedoms of man.\"\nis it the duty of Men, and therefore it our heartfelt desire, to ensure that all men recall their Maxim: “No man shall be ignorant of God”, lest we offend God by stating or acting as if any rule of man’s law is precedental or supercedent to His supreme Law.\n\n\"Is it not written in your law that the law does not compel a man to do the impossible (maxim), and, also, any law contrary to the law of God is no law at all (maxim)? I was exercising my duty of movement upon the common ways. My warrant for doing that is written in the Word of God, \"Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature\" (Mark 16:15), also, \"To visit orphans and widows\" (James 1:27). And it is also written, \"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me\" (Philippians 4:13).\n,\n \"Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law\" \n\"It is also written in your law that an act does not make a man guilty unless the intention be guilty. Since my intention is to do God's Will, and God's Will is not evil, I could not possibly be guilty in this thing I am accused of.\"\n\"I cannot accept any benefits offered by the court. And as a bondman of Christ Jesus, I cannot represent \"myself,\" for that denotes self-will. I don't have any self-will. Jesus the Christ is my Advocate and Wonderful Counselor\" (1 John 2:1, Isaiah 9:6).\nIt is written in your law that \"No man is ignorant of God’s Law\" (Maxim). The Scripture saith, \"There is one lawgiver (James 4:12). The Lord is our lawgiver (Isaiah 33:22).\" It is also written in your law, \"We are all bound to our lawgiver, regardless of our personal interpretation of reality (Maxim). Legality is not reality\" (Maxim). The reality is what God says it is, not what your perception of it is. It is also written in your law, \"There is no fiction without law.

Can you show me any law that says the living must be joined to the dead? God's Law says that we are not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers (2 Corinthians 6:14), and it is also written in your law that “unequal things ought not to be joined” (maxim).

I come under peaceful means and therefore do not wish to or have any want or need to battle or war with the court whatsoever. If it is directly required by the court, I can produce a Peace Bond to that effect in order to demonstrate my good faith and merit in whatever matter exist.\nI'm simply asking for an explanation to which person of title you the court is summoning to speak to? Since it is impossible for myself to be a person of title and I have never created such a person then how can I be linked to such a person? It is my understanding that a person can only appear on a document and therefore I would be committing a fraudulent act by attempting to represent such a person that I had no involvement in creating in the first place or have no permission to do so on behalf of. If there is any confusion regarding this topic, then I apologize for any misunderstanding on my part. \nThat being said, I hope and pray that the court's purpose and intentions in these types of matters is to appropriately and truthfully guide people to make the proper decisions especially concerning the fact of trapping or entrapping themselves into unknowingly and falsely representing a person that they have no association with. I would think that nobody should be forced or threatened into an act that they have not committed or the intent to commit. \nAlso I am not aware of the particular jurisdiction and/or law that the court conducts itself under, but for myself I can only recognize the law that was created and establish by God the Creator, which we as people are to follow by. It is my understanding that there is no law superior in standing then that of the Divine. If I am incorrect or uninformed in my analogy, then I would ask anyone to come forward and present and provide the truth to the contrary. \nThe court in my estimations has taken the liberty of demanding from me that I provide my fingers for printing, which I feel is being conveyed to me under threat of reprisal where could lead to forcible confinement  or worse if I choose not to follow the court's instructions. In good conscience it is very apparent that I cannot subdue any physical attributes that I possess in and on my body. By doing so I would be forfeiting that which I truly possess and that I must guard over for the sake of my health and welfare. So regrettably I obviously cannot submit to the court's demand. \nWhere I may have stated before and wish to remind the court, I do not wish to have any sort of relationship with the court in any manner or shape whatsoever. I feel by doing so I would always be in fear that it would always fall one sided toward the court and I would be open to ridicule and eventually compromised in the end. I only believe in surrounding myself with those people who are truly righteous in faith and kindness.  The court has not demonstrated to me that it is capable of conducting itself in such a manner at this time. "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_520553021313968","body":"Iplan on filing an appeal...

He graduated from the University of Toronto in 1936, and afterwards enrolled at Osgoode Hall Law School. He was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1939. In 1975, Howland was appointed a Judge to the Court of Appeal, Supreme Court of Ontario. Two years later, he was appointed Chief Justice of Ontario, and remained in this position until his retirement in 1992.\nProtecting the rights of individuals in Ontario [edit]\n\nOn April 10, 1989, Chief Justice Howland issued a historic Practice Directive to the Ontario Courts which reaffirmed the right of the citizens of Ontario to audio record their own court hearing under Section 136(2)(b) of Ontario's Courts of Justice Act. In his Practice Directive, Justice Howland stated that the rights of the citizens under section 136(2)(b) of the Act were to be respected by the courts without citizens having to make oral or written arguments. Many consider Justice Howland's directive to the courts as one of his most notable contributions to protecting the rights of self represented individuals before the courts. Even today, Justice Howland's practice directive continues to be used as a reference when audio recording equipment is used by self represented persons in their court hearings.\nPractice Directive (April 10, 1989) [edit]\n”Subject to any order made by the presiding judge as to non-publication of court proceedings, and to the right of the presiding judge to give such directions from time to time as he or she may see fit as to the manner in which an audio recording may be made at a court hearing pursuant to s. 146 [now s. 136] of the Courts of Justice Act, the unobtrusive use of a recording device from the body of the courtroom by a solicitor, a party acting in person, or a journalist for the sole purpose of supplementing or replacing handwritten notes may be considered as being approved without an oral or written application to the presiding judge.” Chief Justice of Ontario W.G.C Howland "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_512832488752688","body":"Notice to whom it may concern.\n[U]nless YOU wish to contract with ME AND/OR inforce one (1, I, IIIIVXXXLCCCCDM) pre existing contract, well, YOU are cordially invited to ..|., &tm; &copy; (go fuck YOUrself) otherwise take a number and wait like the rest of them, OR begin handing me some of those (ooh shiny) Fifty $ .9999 Fine Gold coins for consideration (which means I will Think about it).

Had xxx xxxx been in anyway honourable, I would think he would have made it known, WHEN exactly, he would be arriving, so as to provide the answers to my questions and thus, avoid any confusion, and/or conflict, clearly xxx xxxx has mistaken me, a man, for a \"person\" defined in the fictitious by-law/codes.\n\n  As I had taken the time to take a look through a bit of both the by-law, and the building code act cited, and was unclear how either applied to a real live man, and further, looked to the definition section for clarification, and still found no evidence to that effect, I am not surprised that xxx xxxx opted to disregard my wishes, to first provide some first hand knowledge, and/or facts, that I should be compelled to do anything, as I requested from the start. Rather, xxx xxxx thought that his \"badge\" exempted him from any sort of due process liability, and said as much to me on the phone, his actions of trespass, without first providing me with said evidence, is clear verification that, he either truly has no clue, HOW the by-law/code applies to me, without my CONSENT, Maybe he has never bothered to actually read, and understand the definition section of the by-law/codes he enforces, and thinks that his imaginary authority over a man, and his \" badge\", really does offer xxx xxxx immunity from being personally liable for his actions, and trespasses! Or he would have provided the binding contract, or evidence, that I had asked for from the start, that would compel me to go along with his \"order\".\n \nWhatever the reason, in the spirit of being honourable I will allow xxx xxxx, and/or ANYONE from THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, that can provide a better answer than \"because I have a badge\" (the local police force doesn't even spew that kind of nonsense!), 14 days from receipt of this NOTICE, to rebut everything I have claim to, noticed, and understand, under penalty of perjury, and full commercial liability.\n\nOr you can kindly send me an apology letter, and I in turn will forgive xxx xxxx for his trespasses on my right to privacy, property, security, full disclosure, and also the stress that comes with answering this sort of attack.\n\nCLAIM OF RIGHT: TAKE NOTICE THAT, ALL PROPERTY at the location known as 9577 Walker Road, Mcgregor is held under A COMMON LAW CLAIM OF RIGHT.\n\nFrom the Criminal Code:\n 39. Defence with claim of right\n39. (1) Every one who is in peaceable possession of personal property under a claim of right, and every one acting under his authority, is protected from criminal responsibility for defending that possession, even against a person entitled by law to possession of it, if he uses no more force than is necessary.\n\nSo, to conclude,once again: \n\n 1) Provide the dually signed contract and/or current employment records, that show I, and/or the man known as xx xxx has an obligation to the CORPORATION OF ESSEX, and,\n\n2)Provide the EVIDENCE you are relying on that I, or the MAN known as xxx xx, have harmed, damaged or infringed on another human beings rights or property, as we are of the understanding that none exist, please provide the verified sworn/affirmed complaint, as I have not had an opportunity to hear or see a verified complaint. Who am I harming exactly, and how?\n\n3)Provide proof, and/or first hand knowledge that I, and/or the man known as xxx xx have been given full disclosure to the terms of our alleged relationship with, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, and had thus given consent to be governed by, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, or,\n\n4)Send an apology letter, and/or never contact me again\n\nAgain, the office/agents of the PROPERTY STANDARDS COMMITTEE, THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, AND/OR xxx xxxx,  have 14 days to respond, and/or rebut in writing, with FACTS, to the above notice, claims, and understanding, under penalty of perjury, and full commercial liability.\n\n All rights reserved for Kelleran Holman\n\nwitnessed by:\n\nwitnessed by:\n~end\nshorter and hopefully \"race ready\".... for your consideration group, thanks again!

LEGALLY, WxxMxxx may be correct, however, I LIVE  in, and claim COMMON LAW  jurisdiction, with ALL my inherent rights, I do NOT RESIDE in the CORPORATION OF ESSEX, nor am I a \"PERSON\" within the defintion of the \"codes\" or \"by-laws\" you have cited.

Wxx Mxxx elected to willfully ignore my verbal warnings, and also chose to ignore the postings, and I must presume, deliberately waited for me to be away from my home to commit the trespass...twice, according to the dates on record. Had Wxx Mxxx been in anyway competant and honourable, I would think he would have made it known, WHEN he would be arriving, so as to avoid any confusion about his magical super badge, and it's apparent supreme power! Clearly Wxx Mxxx has mistaken me, a man, for a person from his ficticious by-law/codes.\n\n  As I have taken the time to take a look through a bit of both the by-law, and the building code act cited, and was unclear how either applied to a real live man, and further, looking to the definition section for clarification, and still found no evidence to that effect, I am not surprised that Wxx Mxxx opted to disregard my wishes, to first provide some first hand knowledge, and/or facts, that I should be compelled to do anything, as I requested from the start. Rather, Wxx Mxxx thought that his magical super badge exempted him from any sort of due process liability, and said as much to me on the phone, his actions of trespass, without first providing me with said evidence, is clear verification, that he is either completely incompetant, and truly has no clue, HOW the by-law/code applies to me, without my CONSENT, and has never bothered to actually read, and/or understand the definition section of the by-law/codes he enforces, and thinks that his imaginary authority, and his magical super badge, really does offer Wxx Mxxx immunity from being even personally liable for his actions, and trespasses! Or he was just to lazy to provide the binding contract, or evidence I required, that would compel me to go along with his \"order\", thus causing THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, a certain amount of liability on his behalf.\n \nWhatever the reason, in the spirit of being honourable I will allow Wxx Mxxx, and/or ANYONE from THE CORPORATION OF ESSEX, that can provide a better answer than \"because I have a badge\" magical and super as it must be (the local police force doesn't even spew that kind of nonesense!), 14 days from receipt of this NOTICE, to rebut everything I have claimed, understand, etcetera, under penalty of perjury, and full commercial liability.\n\nNOTICE:\n\"TORT- a BY-LAW-OFFICER is guilty of a Tort, if the By-Law-Officer violates an Anglo-Saxon-Jute Common Law and/or Natural Law Inherited rights.

I frequently can't even get past the misuse of words and grammar to evaluate the message you are attempting to convey.\n\nThere is right and wrong, up and down, on and off.  How can you hope to master the complex when you are working with the comprehension and writing skills of gerbils?  Why do so few know the difference between \"there\", and \"their\", and \"they're\"?  These are completely different words and concepts.  There are applications which offer grammatical advice, and most applications automatically check your spelling.  When the helpful suggestions appear on your screen do you automatically think to yourself, \"Screw this, my writing is too unique and special to be subjected to grammatical scrutiny?  Don't bother to blame anything on \"typing too fast\".  It takes the same amount of time to type something incorrectly as it does to get it right.  Unless you're willing to blame the post on the interference of children or unruly pets, you pressed the \"send\" button.\n\nAssuming you're not all disciples of ee cummings, what is your philosophical objection to starting a sentence with a capital letter, or ending it with punctuation?  Why do you use an apostrophe only when it is absolutely the wrong place to put it?  \"Its\" is possessive, \"it's\" takes two words and contracts them.  People should be described in numbers and not amounts (unless you're making some seriously fucked-up soufflé).  If you understand how something can be ruled out, explain to me how you can \"rule it in\"?  Context is important.  \"I read your email\" is not necessarily the same as \"I read your email yesterday\".  How can you hope to understand complex concepts when you are building on a foundation devoid of the basic building blocks of language?\n\nIf you think the snotty bitch is ridiculing your typographical errors you may be thinking, \"What makes her think she's better than me\"?  I'll save you the trouble by finishing your sentence which could also read, \"What makes her think she's better than me am\"?\n\nI don't take offence when people correct my grammar - I sometimes make mistakes and I prefer to be as accurate as possible in my communication.  This doesn't mean I don't occasionally feel stupid as a result; I just try not to take it too personally.  You may not feel this way.  You may think having attention drawn to your errors is rude or mean-spirited.  Your position is invariably, \"Don't be an ass...you know what I mean.\"  Actually I don't.  \n\nIn order to communicate with you in writing I must first read the sentence, mentally correct the spelling mistakes, attempt to determine if the simple and complex words you are using actually mean what you think they mean.  Along the way there may be a requirement to attempt to determine the overlay of gender-bias, humour or lack thereof, or cultural nuance.  On occasion I must ask for clarification regarding the question or point you pose; and from time-to-time mentally deal with my annoyance at your response of, \"Your an idiot\".  To add insult to injury, you are the very people who deem my writing inaccessible.\n\nYou make me laugh when you ponder learning another language, when you demonstrably can't correctly use the one you have.  While we in Canada embrace multiculturalism and find people with bad communication skills charming, or deserving of our pity, the misuse of words in other languages, in other parts of the world, could actually get you killed.\n\nIn a not-too-clever segway, I remind you that wars have been fought over the misuse, or misunderstanding, of words.  If you think precision in communication is unimportant, I strongly suggest you avoid careers in the field of science, law, engineering, anything involving electricity.\n\n\"If I don't like it go somewhere else?\"  Well, let's see.  These are our forums...and where else is there to go if you are the best the Internet has to offer?\n\nFeel free to comment on this if you feel you are being unfairly evaluated.  If you respond carefully you might just learn something. If you choose to comment be advised your responses will be graded for content and correctness.  There will be bonus points for anyone who can find errors in this post.\n\nThe abuse will continue until the cheese is returned.

You are to issue a T5 to\nthe bank for interest payments (dividends) for a loan but you have to use your BIN number to do this.\nAm I correct in my assumption that...\nSIN (employee) = Registered & controlled by the Crown in right of Canada BIN (employer)= Registered & controlled by man\\woman in their own right???\nYES Somebody is starting to see the picture. Congratulations MAGPIE369 SIN= lower caps name register as employee\nBIN= UPPER CAPS NAME Register as employer\nEverything is simpler than you think and yet more complex than you imagine. You asked for freedom, you now have the knowledge on how to receive freedom from the world of commerce. How you conduct your business\nusing the BIN is by your own due diligence. If you cannot handle freedom then do not register and let the nanny in charge of the SIN number look after you. One has to be careful of what they ask for. You are now on your own!\nI do not understand what you mean “How do I verify the BIN”. The BIN is applied for the same as a SIN number. The SIN number is for the living man to receive benefits from the feds. You are to APPLY for a BIN number to survive in the world of commerce. You apply for one of these when you turn 18. You have to notify the CRA that you want to use your strawman name. If you do not they will only see the SIN being used and you are liable for its use as a beneficiary. The corporation (yours) is already set up now apply to use it and all of its benefits. This is a simple corporate merger. You can apply for the BIN via internet , phone or by mail. I suggest downloading a copy to read and understand the application. Phone if you\n32\ndo not understand.\nThe BIN number is the get out of corporate slavery jail free card! Do you want to be a corporate slave for all of your life? After you receive your BIN\nnumber, order T7DR vouchers with your BIN number on them, to pay your bills. You have to think like you are running a business. The SIN number belongs to the feds and is their property; you cannot order them what to\ndo. Can a slave order its master what to do? Become the master of your\nown affairs.\nPeace and enjoy\nHave fun playing!\nTaken from MASTER TRUST CONVERSATION "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_509636939072243","body":"Australian Constitution is invalid - Ex-Solicitor Wayne Leonard: Vinny Eastwood Show 15/10/10 1/3 youtube.com The Australian constitution Wayne Leonard has discovered is in fact invalid.

CBC Fan Club BREAKING: \nHARPER GOVERNMENT SETS OUT PLANS TO RUN CBC\n\nThe Conservative government's budget bill contains disturbing changes that introduce direct government interference in the public broadcaster's activities.  It is a move that should concern all Canadians.\n\nThe new changes would allow the government to directly interfere in the day to day running of the Corporation. At the heart is a plan for direct interference in collective bargaining between the CBC and its employees. The legislation even goes so far as to place a member of the Treasury Board at the bargaining table. CBC's government appointed Board of Directors would now have to seek government approval to reach any agreement with CBC employees.\n\nThe legislation tabled yesterday effectively eliminates the arms-length relationship with government that's at the heart of public broadcasting.\n\n\"This is an outrageous and unnecessary violation of the principle of public broadcasting. It undermines nearly 80 years of public broadcasting in Canada and around the world by meddling with the essential arms-length relationship between the CBC and the government of the day.  The change is disturbing as it has all the markings of an attempt to turn the CBC into a state broadcaster,\" said Carmel Smyth, National president of the Canadian Media Guild (CMG), the largest union that represents CBC workers.\n\nMarc-Philippe Laurin, CMG Branch president at CBC, calls the change unprecedented. \"This is a dangerous road to go down,\" he comments. \"And make no mistake, this is not about the money. The Conservative government is effectively modifying the Broadcasting Act to inject itself into decisions such as staffing that have a major impact on everything that's done at the CBC.\"\n\nSmyth noted that besides this aggressive intrusion into public broadcasting, there are other recent examples of this conservative government interfering in the labour relations process such as at Canada Post and Air Canada, and all Canadians should be concerned. \"We oppose this change vigorously and are looking at all our options,\" she said.

During every visit he promised the villagers’ riches and happiness if they would but pay their taxes. And the people, well, the people hoped that he would make their lives better. But, sadly, he always made trouble. The villagers made money but then the tax collector would arrive and take more than his due.\n“There’s no outwitting him,” the people complained again during his latest visit. “He always takes more than we can afford to pay.”\n“I can outwit the tax collector,” a clever farmer replied one day, tired of hearing such talk. “No one can do the impossible,” some villagers cautioned him.\nBut others laughed behind his back.\n“He’ll learn his lesson,” they said.\nThough many wished that someone would do just that and outwit the tax collector.\nThe next year the tax collector arrived in the little village, as usual, and, on one very cold spring day, finally made his way to the boastful farmer’s door, demanding loudly, “This year I must have half of your fields production, after all the king needs to feed his soldiers.”\n“Fair enough,” the farmer answered confidently, “Half of my fields’ production shall be yours. Everything that grows above the ground will be reserved for you while all that lies beneath will remain mine.”\n“Agreed,” said the tax collector quickly and with a smirk. “I will return come harvest time to collect the king’s levy,” and, after writing down their pact, the two shook on their bargain.\nCome harvest time the tax collector returned to the village and began to collect levies in the name of the crown. In good time his collection wagons were filled to overflowing but he kept on and, eventually, he ended up once again at the home of the clever farmer.\nRapping loudly on the door he exclaimed, “Come, come my dear man it is time to complete our agreement. All that you have grown is taxed in the name of the king.”\n“Yes, yes good sir,” the clever farmer agreed as he opened his door and led the tax collector to the barn where he stored his crops.\nPulling open the heavy barn doors the two marched inside and the tax collector began to salivate for the barn was fulled to overflowing with turnips.\n“Here you go,” the clever farmer said walking through to the back of his barn and pointing towards stacks and bales of turnip leaves. “What has been grown above ground is yours to the penny.”\n“Unfair,” screamed the tax collector.\n“We made a bargain,” the clever farmer said producing their written agreement.\nAnd the tax collector was forced to accept the withering turnip leaves as payment in full. “I won’t be fooled again,” the tax collector cried, “Next year I demand everything that\ngrows beneath the ground of your fields.”\nAnd with that final threat he marched angrily away.\n“That will be fine by me,” the farmer said after the tax collector fell out of earshot, “For\nnext year I plan to grow wheat.”\n“You see,” the clever farmer told the villagers, “You can outwit the tax collector if you are wise, if you are patient and if you think ahead.” "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_507961122573158","body":"I find this interesting, I'm assuming its a group of people who have taken it on their own to do this, but it sounds like double speak to me what they have on their home page...or is this an attempt to take some control of something that no one claims as their own? \nFreeing People to Transact on\nTheir Own Terms.\n\nBitcoin Foundation standardizes, protects and promotes the use\nof Bitcoin cryptographic money for the benefit of users\nworldwide.\nhttps://bitcoinfoundation.wordpress.com/ "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_507193065983297","body":"SCALPEL!\n\n Governor Wildstar EXPLODES In Court! youtube.com Just another day in court with Governor Wildstar ;}- PLEASE spread this video around so more people will become aware of the corrupt justice system that exis...

Officer Jeff Brown noticed that a man driving a violet 1998 Honda Accord wasn’t wearing his seatbelt around 8:30 AM in February of 2012. The officer flashed his emergency lights and issued Jon Culter, 31, a citation for the offense. Culter, signed the ticket “under duress”, and stated that he was not hurting anyone by choosing to not wear the seat-belt and that he had a god given “free-will” to choose his own actions and that the government has no right to get involved in matters where there are no victims.\n\nCulter fought the ticket in traffic court and went on a lengthy tirade stating that,\n\n“If there is no victim, there is no crime. Show me whose rights I have violated and I will gladly pay them.”\n\nThe courts ignored his conjecture, and he was issued a fine of 50$ plus court costs. However, Mr.Culter, never paid the fine. After months of delinquencies and ignored notices, his license was revoked for his failure to pay the original citation. Just a few weeks after the suspension, Mr.Culter was apprehended and arrested after being pulled over for a faulty brake light on September 20th, 2012 around 8pm. When the officer learned that his license had been suspended, he informed Mr.Culter that he was being arresting. Culter cried out stating,\n\n” I’m just picking up my daughter from a sleepover at her friend’s house, I am not hurting anyone. I have a right to travel. The taxes on my gasoline purchases pay for these roads, I have a right to use these roads.”\n\nCulter’s story was indeed true. He was picking up his daughter from a sleepover with her classmates. Apparently she had gotten ill and called her father to pick her up. Culter’s wife was also recently diagnosed with a pulmonary disorder limiting her ability to exert physical activity, leaving Mr.Culter to take on a lead role in his family affairs.\n\nAfter being processed, Culter was given a trial hearing. Upon the trial date, When the Judge asked why Mr.Culter hadn’t paid his seatbelt citation or obeyed his suspended license status, he answered,\n\n” Because, it’s against the law to operate as a mafia. You can’t just go around demanding people to pay your protection money. Just because I didn’t wear my seatbelt, doesn’t mean I owe someone money! And sure, you may have revoked that piece of plastic you call my “privilege”, however,  a piece of plastic isn’t going to stop me from going to work and taking care of my daughter, I have to work, pay bills, and feed my family………I am a free man on this land and I don’t need your piece of plastic, dismiss this cause your honor…….”\n\nJudge Marsha Blackburn did not share his sentiments. He was sentenced to eleven months and twenty-nine days in the county jail. Culter, was described as an insubordinate inmate. A prison guard, who wants to remain anonymous, stated that Culter frequently had hysterical bouts of manic depression and would constantly shout,\n\n” Why are you kidnapping me! I just want to be with my family. You sick bastards! Let me go!”\n\nThese outbursts often resulted in Mr.Culter being put in solitary confinement and was later ordered to be administered psychoactive prescription drugs to help alleviate his episodes of emotional distress. Over time, Culter’s attitude began to change. He started to attend classes, interacted with other inmates, and ceased his outbursts. Metro Nashville Judge Marsha Blackburn personally visited him while in custody and remarked on his changed attitude.\n\n“I had heard about the antics he was pulling during his initial few weeks in lockdown. He was always yelling, and refusing to eat his meals, and would kick the bars in his cell for hours. However, after being prescribed Zoloft, we really thought he had changed into a model inmate…….”\n\nHowever, Culter’s docile demeanor would soon change. In late March of 2013, Culter was visited by his daugher, Angela Culter, 12, in the Davidson county jail. She informed Culter that his wife, Susan, had taken a turn for the worst, and was admitted into the hospital the previous day. His daughter also informed him that the Department of Child services had sent a notice letter requesting a meeting with Susan about placing her in adoptive care.\n\nAfter hearing this news, Culter stood up and grabbed his daughter and began to proceed towards the exit. The doors leaving the visitation area were blocked by two armed guards, Terry Shavers, and Joseph Cuzniak. Both guards ordered culter to stop immediately while having their guns drawn. Terry Shavers recalled,\n\n” He kept saying, “Let us leave”. My family needs me. My wife is sick. Y’all can’t keep me locked up like an animal. I will pay your stupid extortion fees. Just let me go. My wife is gonna die, and you guys are threatening to take my baby girl away. I’m not staying here no more, man, get the hell out of the way…..”\n\nCulter let go of his daughters hand and and ran towards the two guards knocking one down. Culter was heading towards the exit doors,however, they were locked. He began kicking the doors trying to force them open. That’s when Joseph Cuzniak grabbed Culter in a bear-hug like wrestling move. Culter was able shake Cuzniak off, while officer shavers grabbed culters daughter in an attempt to lead her away from the conflict. Culter saw that Shavers was taking his daughter away and began to run towards shavers yelling, “Please give my daughter back, she isn’t your child!” , and that’s when Officer Cuzniak shot Culter with his .40 caliber Beretta, hitting him in the base of his skull.\n\nCulter fell to the floor laying motionless. Shavers ran to culter and flipped his body over, asking him if he knew where he was. Culter uttered,  ”My wife needs me, Angela needs me.” Seconds later he began to convulse, and within minutes, he died on the scene approximately at 2:35 pm Saturday afternoon with his daughter looking on.\n\nOfficer Cuzniak could not be reached for comment, however officer Shavers commented by saying,\n\n” I don’t know who the bad guy is anymore. We were just doing our job, but then again, maybe the system is set up this way. They give officers quotas, and we have to justify our jobs. Maybe the law has become too broad and bureaucratic. I just don’t know what I am going to do now, now that I have this on my conscious. The look on his daughter’s face will forever be burned in my mind, and that scream……….”\n\nOfficer Shavers began to break down in tears and requested the interview to be stopped.\n\nIt has come to the attention to our network that Culter’s wife Susan, died of heart complications monday morning around midnight on 4/15/2013. It is unsure at this point on where Culter’s daughter Angela will be placed. Culter did have a sister, however, she could not be reached for contact.\n\nCurrently, Angela Culter is in State Custody awaiting further instructions until a full investigation can be done into her family history, to make sure any remaining family members are qualified, as deemed by the state of Tennessee, to be legally qualified to take her into custody.\n\nNews channel 12 RSPCT did catch up with Culter’s next door neighbor, Ron Balicki, 83, whom weighed in on the situation,\n\n” I think the state should be sued. He never hurt nobody. All that man did was work at his construction job day and night. Trying to take care of that sick wife. It’s all because of that damn seatbelt ticket. Jon was always talking about the constitution, and the government, he was real big on freedom and talking about politics and stuff like that…..it’s a real shame what happened, he was a good man. He always changed my oil for me and my wife, because we are so old, we can’t do it ourselves.”\n\nAs of now, there is a full investigation on the matter. Both of the guards who were present during the incident are on administrative leave until further notice. No lawsuits have been filed at this point, however, investigations are still too early to determine whether or not the guards were at fault. Jon Culter’s house was searched this morning, and police discovered books on Anarchism, and constitutional essays. President Obama gave us all a grim reminder in his speech earlier today regarding the news about Jon Culter,\n\n” It’s never a good thing when human life is ended. I am sure Jon loved his family, and his story is a complex one. However, we cannot jump to conclusions until a full investigation has taken place. It has come to my attention that Mr.Culter was some type of anti-government advocate. This is a grim reminder to us all, that those who preach about freedom, the constitution, and abolishing the government may sound like romantic heroes, but can actually turn out to be a fearsome combatant just as dangerous as any Al-Qaeda member. We cannot take anti-government statements lightly. People who subscribe to these ideologies of “extreme” freedom, are really just advocates of chaos.”\n\n- President Obama\n\n4/15/203 "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_503995079636429","body":"THE BANKS ARE NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK.\n\nTHE BANKS ALWAYS TRY TO CATCH YOU WITH THEIR RULES AND REGULATIONS.

Unless openly rebuked and rejected by stating clearly the matter is to be on the Public Record, the matter remains a private Bar Guild matter completely under private Bar Guild rules; and\n(ii) The Presumption of Public Service is that all the members of the Private Bar Guild who have all sworn a solemn secret absolute oath to their Guild then act as public agents of the Government, or “public officials” by making additional oaths of public office that openly and deliberately contradict their private \"superior\" oaths to their own Guild. Unless openly rebuked and rejected, the claim stands that these private Bar Guild members are legitimate public servants and therefore trustees under public oath; and\n(iii) The Presumption of Public Oath is that all members of the Private Bar Guild acting in the capacity of \"public officials\" who have sworn a solemn public oath remain bound by that oath and therefore bound to serve honestly, impartiality and fairly as dictated by their oath. Unless openly challenged and demanded, the presumption stands that the Private Bar Guild members have functioned under their public oath in contradiction to their Guild oath. If challenged, such individuals must recuse themselves as having a conflict of interest and cannot possibly stand under a public oath; and\n￼￼￼￼\n(iv) The Presumption of Immunity is that key members of the Private Bar Guild in the capacity of \"public officials\" acting as judges, prosecutors and magistrates who have sworn a solemn public oath in good faith are immune from personal claims of injury and liability. Unless openly challenged and their oath demanded, the presumption stands that the members of the Private Bar Guild as public trustees acting as judges, prosecutors and magistrates are immune from any personal accountability for their actions; and\n(v) The Presumption of Summons is that by custom a summons unrebutted stands and therefore one who attends Court is presumed to accept a position (defendant, juror, witness) and jurisdiction of the court. Attendance to court is usually invitation by summons. Unless the summons is rejected and returned, with a copy of the rejection filed prior to choosing to visit or attend, jurisdiction and position as the accused and the existence of \"guilt\" stands; and\n(vi) The Presumption of Custody is that by custom a summons or warrant for arrest unrebutted stands and therefore one who attends Court is presumed to be a thing and therefore liable to be detained in custody by \"Custodians\". Custodians may only lawfully hold custody of property and \"things\" not flesh and blood soul possessing beings. Unless this presumption is openly challenged by rejection of summons and/or at court, the presumption stands you are a thing and property and therefore lawfully able to be kept in custody by custodians; and\n(vii) The Presumption of Court of Guardians is the presumption that as you may be listed as a \"resident\" of a ward of a local government area and have listed on your \"passport\" the letter P, you are a pauper and therefore under the \"Guardian\" powers of the government and its agents as a \"Court of Guardians\". Unless this presumption is openly challenged to demonstrate you are both a general guardian and general executor of the matter (trust) before the court, the presumption stands and you are by default a pauper, and lunatic and therefore must obey the rules of the clerk of guardians (clerk of magistrates court);\n￼￼￼￼\n(viii) The Presumption of Court of Trustees is that members of the Private Bar Guild presume you accept the office of trustee as a \"public servant\" and \"government employee\" just by attending a Roman Court, as such Courts are always for public trustees by the rules of the Guild and the Roman System. Unless this presumption is openly challenged to state you are merely visiting by \"invitation\" to clear up the matter and you are not a government employee or public trustee in this instance, the presumption stands and is assumed as one of the most significant reasons to claim jurisdiction - simply because you \"appeared\"; and\n(ix) The Presumption of Government acting in two roles as Executor and Beneficiary is that for the matter at hand, the Private Bar Guild appoint the judge/magistrate in the capacity of Executor while the Prosecutor acts in the capacity of Beneficiary of the trust for the current matter. Unless this presumption is openly challenged to demonstrate you are both a general guardian and general executor of the matter (trust) before the court, the presumption stands and you are by default the trustee, therefore must obey the rules of the executor (judge/magistrate); and\n(x) The Presumption of Executor De Son Tort is the presumption that if the accused does seek to assert their right as Executor and Beneficiary over their body, mind and soul they are acting as an Executor\nDe Son Tort or a \"false executor\" challenging the \"rightful\" judge as Executor. Therefore, the judge/magistrate assumes the role of \"true\" executor and has the right to have you arrested, detained, fined or forced into a psychiatric evaluation. Unless this presumption is openly challenged by not only asserting one's position as Executor as well as questioning if the judge or magistrate is seeking to act as Executor De Son Tort, the presumption stands and a judge or magistrate of the private Bar guild may seek to assistance of bailiffs or sheriffs to assert their false claim; and\n￼￼￼\n(xi) The Presumption of Incompetence is the presumption that you are at least ignorant of the law, therefore incompetent to present yourself and argue properly. Therefore, the judge/magistrate as executor has the right to have you arrested, detained, fined or forced into a psychiatric evaluation. Unless this presumption is openly challenged to the fact that you know your position as executor and beneficiary and actively rebuke and object to any contrary presumptions, then it stands by the time of pleading that you are incompetent then the judge or magistrate can do what they need to keep you obedient; and\n(xii) The Presumption of Guilt is the presumption that as it is presumed to be a private business meeting of the Bar Guild, you are guilty whether you plead \"guilty\", do not plead or plead \"not guilty\". Therefore unless you either have previously prepared an affidavit of truth and motion to dismiss with extreme prejudice onto the public record or call a demurrer, then the presumption is you are guilty and the private Bar Guild can hold you until a bond is prepared to guarantee the amount the guild wants to profit from you.

The most common of the other such prerogative writs are quo warranto, prohibito, mandamus, procedendo, and certiorari. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.\n\nAlso... Pay attention to these writs in particular:\n\nQuo warranto (Medieval Latin for \"by what warrant?\") is a prerogative writ requiring the person to whom it is directed to show what authority they have for exercising some right or power (or \"franchise\") they claim to hold.\n\nA writ of prohibition is a writ directing a subordinate to stop doing something the law prohibits. In practice, the Court directs the Clerk to issue the Writ, and directs the Sheriff to serve it on the subordinate, and the Clerk prepares the Writ and gives it to the Sheriff, who serves it. This writ is normally issued by a superior court to the lower court asking it not to proceed with a case which does not fall under its jurisdiction.These Writs are issued as \"alternative\" or \"peremptory.\" An alternative Writ directs the recipient to immediately act, or desist, and \"Show Cause\" why the directive should not be made permanent. A peremptory Writ directs the recipient to immediately act, or desist, and \"return\" the Writ, with certification of its compliance, within a certain time.When an agency of an official body is the target of the Writ of Prohibition, the Writ is directed to the official body over which the court has direct jurisdiction, ordering the official body to cause the agency to desist.Although the rest of this article speaks to judicial processes, a writ of prohibition may be directed by any court of record (i.e., higher than a misdemeanor court) toward any official body, whether a court or a county, city or town government, that is within the court's jurisdiction.\n\nMandamus is a judicial remedy which is in the form of an order from a superior court to any government subordinate court, corporation or public authority to do or forbear from doing some specific act which that body is obliged under law to do or refrain from doing, as the case may be, and which is in the nature of public duty and in certain cases of a statutory duty. It cannot be issued to compel an authority to do something against statutory provision. For example, it cannot be used to force a lower court to reject or authorize applications that have been made, but if the court refuses to rule one way or the other then a mandamus can be used to order the court to rule on the applications.Mandamus may be a command to do an administrative action or not to take a particular action, and it is supplemented by legal rights. In the American legal system it must be a judicially enforceable and legally protected right before one suffering a grievance can ask for a mandamus. A person can be said to be aggrieved only when he is denied a legal right by someone who has a legal duty to do something and abstains from doing.\n\n Interesting terms one should also familiarize oneself with these as well:\n\n    aggrieve[ uh-greev ]verb (used with object) ag·grieved, ag·griev·ing.1. to oppress or wrong grievously; injure by injustice.2. to afflict with pain, anxiety, etc.\n\n    Franchise[ fran-chahyz ]noun1. a privilege of a public nature conferred on an individual, group, or company by a government: a franchise to operate a bus system.2. the right or license granted by a company to an individual or group to market its products or services in a specific territory.3. a store, restaurant, or other business operating under such a license.4. the territory over which such a license extends.5. the right to vote: to guarantee the franchise of every citizen.6. a privilege arising from the grant of a sovereign or government, or from prescription, which presupposes a grant.7. a player of great talent or popular appeal, considered vitally important to a team's success or future.8. a legal immunity or exemption from a particular burden, exaction, or the like.9. freedom, especially from imprisonment, servitude, or moral restraint.

Thus a deposit of money in a bank is a \"trust\", or the RECEIPT(think REVENUE RECEIPT) of money to be applied to a particular purpose or to be paid to another is a \"trust.\"\n\nRES (latin): the thing; the subject matter of actions that are primarily IN REM i.e. actions that establish rights in relation to an object, as opposed to a person, or IN PERSONAM. For example, in an action that resolves a conflict over title to real property, the land in question is the RES. Tangible PERSONAL PROPERTY can also be a \"res,\" as in the CORPUS of a trust. In a QUASI in rem proceeding, land or chattels that are seized and attached at the beginning of the action, in order that they may later be used to satisfy a personal claim, are the res of such suits. The term refers as well to the status of individuals. Thus, in a divorce suit, the marital status is the res. The purpose of a res is to establish a court's JURISDICTION, i.e. if the property lies within the state where the action is brought, or an individual in a divorce action is a DOMICILLARY of the state, then jurisdiction is established.\n\nCORPUS (latin): body. The principal mass of a physical substance. It is the principal or res of an ESTATE, DEVISE or BEQUEST from which income is derived. In the law of trusts, any valid trust must have a valid subject matter or corpus; the corpus can consist of any transferable interest, vested or contingent, legal or equitable, real or personal, tangible or intangible, as long as the subject matter is \"certain.\" Intangible things such as a copyright or the good will of a business or a trade secret, if transferable by gift, inter vivos or by will, can constitute the corpus of a trust. In the law of real property, the term refers to all tangible objects; thus, the roadway, embankment and equipment constitute the corpus of railroad property. ROYALTIES from oil and gas in a well also constitute the corpus of the land. The term generally is found in civil law denoting a positive fact as distinguished from a possibility. See corpus delecti. It also refers to an aggregate of a substance such as the law. See corpus juris.  \n\nAGGREGATE: a total of all the parts; the whole, the complete amount; also, to combine, as to aggregate several causes of action in a single suit; similarly, to aggregate many persons whose causes of actions are closely related into a class action.\n\nESTATE: interest, right or ownership in land; technically, the degree, quantity, nature and extent of a person's interest or ownership of land. In its broad sense, \"estate\" applies to all that a person owns, whether REAL or PERSONAL property. See also PRIVITY [privity of estate]\n\nPRIVITY OF ESTATE: denotes mutual or successive relation to the same right in property. A privy in estate is one who derives from another TITLE to property, by contract (grant, will, or other voluntary transfer of possession), or law (descent, judgment, etc.) \n\nDEVISE: traditionally a GIFT of real property made by will. A testamentary act by which a now-deceased person manifested his intent to create one or more interests in land or in a thing other than land, irrespective of whether such act is effective to create such interest. Simplicity of statement requires that a single word be available to describe a testamentary act intended to dispose of interests in land, interests in things other than land or both these types of interests. The employment of two words, such as DEVISE and BEQUEATH is awkward.\n\nBEQUEATH: the appropriate term for making a GIFT of personalty by means of a will. Strictly, it signifies a gift of personal property, which distinguishes it from a DEVISE, which is a gift of real property. A DISPOSITION is the generic name encompassing both a bequest of personalty and a devise of realty. However, when a testator's intention is obvious, \"bequeath\" is considered synonymous with \"devise.\"\n\nLEGACY: GIFT, or BEQUEST by will of personal property. The term is frequently confused with devise, which refers to a disposition of real property, but the technical distinction between \"legacy\" and \"devise\" will not defeat a testator's intention, so that either term may be used to dispose of real or personal property. It is regarded as synonymous with bequest. Compare to devise.

A draft, check, CERTIFICATE of deposit, and NOTE may or may not be a negotiable instrument depending upon whether the above elements of negotiability are satisfied. A TRANSFEREE of a negotiable instrument may have rights superior to to the ASSIGNEE of other obligations if the transferee qualifies as a holder in due course.\n\nBEARER: the person in possession of an instrument, document of title, or security payable to bearer or endorsed in blank. A note payable to bearer is payable to any person who successively holds the note BONA FIDE, not by virtue of any assignment of promise, but by an original and direct promise moving from the maker to the bearer.\n\nBONA FIDE (latin): in good faith; without fraud or deceit.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT: an acknowledgment by a bank of receipt of money with an engagement to repay it. The writing may or may not be a negotiable instrument depending on whether it meets the requirements for negotiability.\n\nNOTE: a writing acknowledging a debt and promising payment. For the instrument to be negotiable it must be signed by the maker and contain an unconditional promise to pay a sum certain in money on demand or at a definite time to order or to bearer. A note is not payment but only a promise to pay. The term note is synonomous with the term promissory note. The term may be qualified by its unique characteristics. For example, a note that is backed by a pledge of collateral such as real or personal property is called a SECURED NOTE; when no such collateral is behind the promise it is called an UNSECURED NOTE. If the note is payable at any time it is called a DEMAND NOTE. If the note is payable over a specified period of time in more than one payment, it is called an INSTALLMENT NOTE. If the note evidences a loan for which real estate has been encumbered it is called a MORTGAGE NOTE. If the note is negotiable it is called a NEGOTIABLE NOTE. These various terms can also be combined so that a note that is payable at any time, secured by collateral may be called a \"negotiable secured promissory demand note,\" and so forth. See also treasury note.\n\nTREASURY NOTE: an intermediate term (one-to-five years) obligation of the (U.S.) government that bears interest paid by COUPON. Like all direct (U.S.) government obligations, Treasury notes carry the highest domestic credit standing and, thus, have the lowest taxable yield available at equivalent maturity.\n\nCOUPONS: certificates, usually attached to an instrument evidencing a loan, which may be detached (clipped) and presented separately for payment of a specific sum of money representing interest on the main instrument. See bond [Bearer Bonds] Bonds are available in two forms.\n\nBEARER BONDS: are negotiable instruments that must be SAFEGUARDED (think Registrar GENERAL) by the owner to prevent loss. Interest is paid by COUPON redemptions. \n\nREGISTERED (think REGISTRAR General) BONDS: are recorded on the books of the issuer by the TRUSTEE, and interest is paid BY MAIL to the HOLDER of record. See security [Bond]; treasury bond.\n\nHOLDER OF RECORD (Black's 8th-edition): See STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD.\n\nSTOCKHOLDER OF RECORD: the person who is listed in the issuer's books as the owner of stock on the RECORD DATE.\n\nRECORD OWNER: 1. a property owner in whose name the title appears in the public records. 2. Stockholder of Record.\n\nDATE OF ISSUE: 1. Commercial law. an arbitrary date (for notes, bonds, and other documents in a series) fixed as the beginning of the term for which they run; the date that a stock or bond bears on its face, not the date on which it is actually signed, delivered, or put into circulation. When a bond is delivered to a purchaser, it is considered ISSUED. But this concept is distinguishable from the \"date of issue,\" which remains fixed, regardless of the date of sale or delivery. 2. Insurance. The date specified in the policy as the \"date of issue,\" not the date on which the policy is executed or delivered, and regardless of other dates that may be specified in the policy or elsewhere, such as the date that the policy is to \"take effect.\"\n\nRECORD DATE: Corporations. The date on which a stockholder must own shares to be entitled to vote or receive a DIVIDEND. See Ex-Dividend Date.\n\nEX-DIVIDEND (Barron's): without a RIGHT to a declared dividend. When a stock trades ex-dividend the buyer does not receive the declared dividend because the date on which he will officially own the stock will occur after the record date of ownership for purposes of receiving same. A stock will trade ex-dividend during the settlement period, usually five business days, between the execution of an order to buy or sell the SECURITY by a broker and the date of settlement when the CERTIFICATE and funds change hands. The Payment Date refers to when the dividend is actually paid and is usually sometime after the ex-dividend date (sometimes called simply EX-DATE) and the record date. \n\nBOND: Security. written instrument with SURETIES, guaranteeing faithful performance of acts or duties contemplated; evidence of a debt; a binding agreement, a COVENANT between two or more persons, or an instrument under SEAL by which the maker binds himself, and usually also his heirs, executors and administrators or, if a corporation, their successors, to do or not to do a specified act. A bond may thus be the obligation of a state, its subdivision, or a private corporation, represented by certificate for principal, and by detachable coupons for current interest; includes all interest-bearing obligations of persons, firms, and corporations. The rights of the HOLDER are specified in the bond INDENTURE, which contains the legal terms and conditions under which the bond was issued. Bond debt is secured or guaranteed primarily by the ability of the issuer (borrower) to pay the interest when due and to repay the principal at maturity. See Certificate of Indebtedness or Security.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF INDEBTEDNESS (Black's 8th): 1. Debenture 2. Treasury Bill 3. Certificate of Deposit\n\nDEBENTURE (Barron's): a written acknowledgment of a debt with a promise to pay; financial obligation of corporations often bought and sold as investments. Compare Certificate of Deposit; Note. Holders of debentures representing corporate indebtedness, as CREDITORS of the corporation, are ENTITLED to payment before stockholders [the owners of the corporation] upon dissolution of the corporation. To protect debenture holders who rank as general creditors, the debentures might limit borrowing, impose a current liabilities-assets-margin requirement, restrict dividend payments, limit share redemption or purchase, require the maintenance of certain reserves, or restrict additional issues of securities. See Indenture.\n\nINDENTURE: a DEED between two parties conveying real estate by which both parties assume obligations. \"Indenture\" implies a SEALED instrument. Historically, Indenture referred to a crease or wavy cut that was made in duplicates of the deed so their authenticity could be verified later. In a business context, an indenture is a lengthy written agreement which sets forth the terms under which bonds or debentures may be issued. Terms include the amount of the issue, the interest rate, the maturity, the property pledged as collateral (if any), and the so-called \"protective covenants.\" An independent trustee, usually a BANK (BANK OF CANADA?) or trust company, is named to oversee the issuance of the bonds, to COLLECT and PAY interest and principal, and to protect the bondholder's RIGHTS as specified in the indenture. \n\nDEED OF TRUST: a TRANSFER of LEGAL TITLE to property from the TRUSTOR [SETTLOR] to the trustee (now US), for the purpose of placing the legal title with the trustee as SECURITY for the performance of certain obligations, monetary or otherwise.\n\nTRUSTOR: one who creates a trust; more often called the settlor.\n\nSETTLOR [DONOR; TRUSTOR]: one who creates a trust by giving real or personal property \"in trust\" to another (the trustee) for the benefit of a third person (the beneficiary). One who gives such money is said to \"settle\" it on, or bring title to rest with, the trustee, and is also called the \"donor\" or \"trustor.\"\n\nDONOR: one who gives or makes a GIFT; creator of a trust; the party conferring a power e.g. the grantor of a power of appointment.\n\nGIFT: a voluntary transfer of property made without consideration, that is, for which no value is received in return. The essential components of a valid completed gift of personal property are: competency of the donor to understand the nature of his act; voluntary intent on the part of the donor to make a gift (called DONATIVE INTENT); DELIVERY either actual or symbolic; ACCEPTANCE, actual or imputed; complete divestment of all control by the donor; and a lack of consideration for the gift. A transfer that constitutes a gift may be of significance in several TAX contexts. For example, RECEIPT of a gift is excluded from the GROSS INCOME of the recipient, but the transferor may be subject to the unified estate and gift tax. \n\nDONATIVE INTENT (Black's 8th): the intent to surrender DOMINION and control over the GIFT that is being made.\n\nDOMINION: having BOTH title to AND possession of property; having CONTROL of both ownership and use.\n\nPOWER OF APPOINTMENT (Black's 8th): a power created or reserved by a person having property subject to DISPOSITION, enabling the donee of the power to designate transferees of the property or shares in which it will be received; especially a power conferred on  a donee by will or DEED to select and determine one or more recipients of the donor's estate or income. If the power is exercisable before the donee's death, it is exercisable WHOLLY in favour of the donee. If the power is testamentary, it is exercisable wholly in favour of the donee's estate.\n\nGENERAL POWER OF APPOINTMENT: a power of appointment by which the donee can appoint - that is, DISPOSE of the donor's property - in favour of ANYONE at all, including oneself or one's own estate; especially a power that authorizes the ALIENATION of a fee to any ALIENEE.  Often shortened to general power. "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_500283073340963","body":"The POWER OF APPOINTMENT- thread.....\n\nBarron's Law Dictionary 3rd-edition 1991- POWER OF APPOINTMENT: a power or authority given by a DONOR to a DONEE to appoint the beneficiaries of the donor's property, or any interest therein, which is vested in a person other than the donee of the power. The power may be created by DEED or will, id., and it may be reserved by the donor for him or herself. The instrument creating the power delineates the extent to which the donee may choose the beneficiaries of the donor's property. Under a GENERAL POWER, the power may be exercised in favour  of any person, including the donee. Under a SPECIAL POWER, the power may be exercised only in favour of a limited group, not including the donee or his or her estate. Present day powers of appointments are more flexible in determining beneficiaries than if a DISPOSITION irrevocably named all takers, a flexibility that allows for unforeseen future events. For example, a father's will may give his daughter the power of appointment over the principal of a trust, with the result that the daughter can allocat e the principal as needed when she exercises the power. Under a more inflexible procedure whereby the father names all the beneficiaries and the amount to which they are entitled, adjustments could not be made for differing needs. If the father wants to insure that only the daughter's children are the beneficiaries, he can so provide by giving a \"special power of appointment\" to the daughter. The instrument creating the power usually will include a provision disposing of the property if the power is not effectively exercised. TITLE to the property or interest passes directly from the donor of the power to the beneficiary; the donee is merely the conduit through which title passes. Moreover, since a power of appointment does not constitute an ESTATE or interest, it is termed a NAKED POWER. If in the same instrument creating the power of appointment the donee is granted a present or future interest  in the property over which the power is to be exercised, the donee is said to have a power coupled with an interest. A general power of appointment for tax purposes (subject to exceptions) is \"a power which is exercisable in favour of the DECEDENT, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.\" If that definition is met, the value of the underlying property is includable in the value of the decedent's taxable gross estate. Therefore, special powers of appointment are generally better from a tax viewpoint.\n\nPOWER OF APPOINTMENT (Black's 8th)- a power created or reserved by a person having property subject to DISPOSITION, enabling the donee of the power to designate transferees of the property or shares in which it will be received; especially, a power conferred on a donee by will or deed to select and determine one or more recipients of the donor's estate or income. If the power is exercisable before the donee's death, it is exercisable wholly in favour of the donee. If the power is TESTAMENTARY, it is exercisable wholly in favour of the donee's estate. Often shortened to POWER. Also termed ENABLING POWER.\n\nPOWER OF APPOINTMENT (The Dictionary of Canadian Law 3rd-edition): 1. the power of a DONEE or APPOINTOR to appoint by will the PEOPLE who will succeed to property after the person to whom the power is given dies. This power is given by a DONOR using an instrument such as a trust INTER VIVOS, marriage settlement or will. (J.G. McLeod, The Conflict of Laws: Carswell) 2. Includes any discretionary power to transfer a beneficial interest in property without the furnishing of valuable consideration.\n\nDONEE: 1. any person who receives  or has received the benefit of a GIFT, including a gift deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to have been made. GIFT TAX acts. 2. One to whom a gift is made. 3. a person to whom a power of appointment is given is sometimes called the donee of the power.\n\nAPPOINTOR: One given a power; a person who names someone else for an office.\n\nDONOR: 1. One who gives. 2. Any individual who makes or who has made a gift, including a gift deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to have been made. GIFT TAX acts. \n\nINTER VIVOS TRUST: created by writing, a DEED or oral declaration, a trust which is to take effect during the lifetime of the trust's creator. (Waters, The Law of Trusts in Canada: Carswell)\n\nINTER VIVOS GIFT: a GRATUITOUS transfer of property from the owner (donor) to another person (donee) with the intention that the transfer will take effect immediately and the title to the property will rest in the donee.\n\nINTER VIVOS: Between living people. See GIFT INTER VIVOS.\n\nGRATUITOUS: without reward or recompense.\n\nRECOMPENSE (Black's 8th): repayment, compensation, or retribution for something, especially an injury or loss.\n\nGIFT INTER VIVOS (Dictionary of Canadian Law): a gift made by a living person to another living person.\n\nGIFT INTER VIVOS (Black's 8th): See inter vivos gift under GIFT. a gift of personal property made during the donor's lifetime and delivered to the donee with the intention of IRREVOCABLY surrendering control over the property.\n\nIRREVOCABLE: committed beyond recall; unalterable; not able to be revoked.\n\nGIFT INTER VIVOS (Barron's): see inter vivos. Between the living; transactions made \"inter vivos\" are those made while the parties are living, and not upon death (such as in the case of inheritance) or upon contemplation of death [causa mortis]. A DEED, therefore, is an instrument that CONVEYS inter vivos a present interest in land, or which conveys the CORPUS of a trust to the trustees [a deed of trust].

He made his official announcement on his forum a couple of hours ago. As usual, being the charismatic and well-spoken character that he is, he made it sound like it was an \"Experiment\" and part of his master plan. And the sad part is that most of his followers are more likely to believe him. Isn't it funny how all con artists usually posses the same charismatic and well-spoken traits! \n\nIn other words, he is admitting that he has deceived, conned and manipulated me, my radio show listeners, all the members of this group and the members of his forum for the last 5 months, and that he's done it for the good of all. I don't know about you, but to me for someone to even think of doing that, not that I believe a single word of it, but simply for thinking of such an evil scheme makes him out to be a person no better than those corrupt governments who try to deceive us. Bravo Mr. Dean Clifford! You get a 10 out of 10 for that. You have just graduated to the same level of existence as Kevin Annett! I'm sure you must be very proud of yourself!\n\nAnyway, those of you who wish to leave this group and follow in the footsteps of this new self-proclaimed savior, who plans to free all of the people of this planet with his well-calculated plan, I bid you farewell. However, if you decide to stay, then be advised that, as of this moment, Dean Clifford is considered to be in the same category as Kevin Annett and, like Kevin, he is not to be promoted on this group.\n\nAll the audio recordings, text messages and emails between Dean and I over the last 5 months will be compiled and made available to anyone who wishes to examine them. I personally believe that his announcement today was intended to make you all believe that everything he has said on those audio recordings and messages were all staged as part of his master plan. I guess he feels that he really is that smart, and that we are all that stupid in that we will believe that the reason he has not produced any of the lesson plans he has been promising for the last 5 months for the FU project, is because he was trying to prove a point. That's right Dean, I guess all those times you said on air that you are very disorganized and can't get anything done, that was all part of your master plan, right? So, does this mean that all the teachings he did on the radio show was also false and part of his set up? Of course, I expect him to make such claims. How else can he justify all that evidence on those audio files and messages? Anyway, whether you believe his claim or not is entirely up to you.\n\nAs for me, Global F.A.C.T. and FU, I think 5 months was enough time wasted on this deceiver and his accomplices. Over the last week, Dean's behavior and things he has said to me had raised a lot of red flags. I had anticipated this and hence started working on an alternative plan.

No one seems to see it, as if it is invisible and has no meaning, but IT is the creator. They also miss the words about the jury trial and words of \"common law\". No one invokes the common law because the laws established under the 14th amendment are not common law, but they cannot be in conflict with it, and they aren't. People do not know who they are and where they came from, why they are here, and where their Rights come from. The Amendments are a restatement of rights but under the 14th amendment they are ONLY a codicil that changes the intentions of the founding fathers. Thus Civil Rights.\n\nTo invoke the common law one must ask the administrators which office they represent (office of trust or office of profit), inform them they are trustees of the trust you are a beneficiary/legatee/heir of, tell them where the Trust resides, inform them that Rights do not devolve through an office of profit, that they would be in breach of trust if they continue to follow their proceedings as is, and that as an Heir you are invoking the Common Law of England as it stands in this country.\n\nUnder Constitutional Law a court — ANY court, MUST look toward the Trust first and make determinations from that point, not statutory law.

From Greek, dispersion, from diaspeirein; to scatter, from dia- + speirein to sowthe movement, migration, or scattering of a people away from an established or ancestral homeland.\n===============================================\n2016 has been an interesting year, so far.  I'm now at the phase of my initiative where people are starting to put some pieces together.  Those of you who have studied under me, are familiar with the ground rules of any large-scale operation.   The principle one is, \"While you're building, NEVER LET THEM TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY\"!\n\nUnfortunately this rule has now been broken, because people are now starting to take me seriously.  Most of 2010 was occupied with the ongoing research and development of cryptographic currencies.  One of the first things I set out to do, once cryptographic currencies turned out to be viable, was to seek out those who understood the legal ramifications of what was being built, and people who understand what money is.  I'm sad to say that in 2010, the only ones that were even qualified to hear what I had to say, were a few smart Libertarians and the FREE-DUMBERS.  I actively sought out Robert Menard.  This, of course, turned out to be a colossal failure.   While Menard was more than qualified, it didn't change the fact that he's a lying, drunk, con artist.   A year later, Dean Clifford sought me out.  He was more interested in the AQUILAE TRUST than he was in any fancy computer money.  Menard actually tried to \"mansplain\" that the whole purpose behind money is that you can \"buy things with it\", and made the ever popular comment, \"What if the server goes down?\"  It's the one thing I've noticed about the FREE-DUMBERS.  They really seem to hate technology.  Dean Clifford aggressively fought to avoid learning anything.  I point out to everyone who will listen, how intimately tied to computer science all of your lives are.  I've lived nearly half a century on this planet, and all the things I grew up with, are gone.  \n\nThere are no telephones.  There are computers pretending to be telephones.  There are no radios.  There are computers pretending to be radios.  There are no televisions.  There are computers pretending to be televisions.  To this day, I still get confused looks when I say that there are no cars; there are just rolling unsecured networks of computers, pretending to be cars.  It's a matter of PUBLIC RECORD that I literally pretended to be a \"retard\" so I could get access to computers.  I wasn't the only one.  His name was Peter Sheppard.  He had no interest in computer science.  He was just lazy and didn't want to do any actual school work, which I totally respected him for.   That action was one of my first \"practise what you preach\" exercises.  When you're smarter than everyone else around you, the opinions and perceptions of everyone else around you become irrelevant.   This was my first real-world exercise of this concept, and it's not as easy as I make it sound.  I was also fourteen years-old.  At the time there were a lot of factors working against my interest over which I had absolutely no control.  \n\nNow in 2016, I find myself in the unique position of understanding more than all of my fellow man.  This is not an arrogant declaration.  It is a fact.  I have simply dedicated more effort to the task than everybody else in history; because at that early age, I fell in love with computers.  At the time they were just simple enough for the average man to understand.   I could tell you exactly how a Commodore 64 CPU worked.  I have no fucking clue how an i7 works, but I do know from those fundamentals acquired in the early days, the things that must be true.  This means I can understand how an i7 works, should I choose to.  Is the Internet what I thought it would become in the old days?  Hell no!  Those few times I attempted to express to my family what it was I was doing, and studying, and spending my time on, they literally labelled me \"crazy\", and told everyone I was pretending to be part of a \"secret society\".   They just shrugged this off, as the by-product of having been sold to the government.  Yes, they really did that shit in the '70s; and only to people with \"Noble Lineage\".  I'll be covering that on Diaspora when our POD is ready....\n\n...but I digress...\n\nYou read the above and there's no way anyone reading this without context could think that these things are anything but the ramblings of a madman...except they're all true, and I've shown that they're all true, and I'm going to show more truth.  \n\nThese are truths you simply couldn't understand without acquiring the knowledge you've gained so far.  It's starting to happen.  People outside the LAW SOCIETY and the upper caste of the ATTORNEY GENERAL are starting to take me seriously.   I will admit that there is this latent fear that I'll wake up in the morning with Vice saying they totally found Satoshi Nakamoto this morning...honest...and a really bad picture from high school serving as the background.  But I think I'm ok.  I don't have much to worry about, because as I've said before, it's really difficult to sell somebody an idea.  It is, however, stupidly simple to sell them money.  I have made a lot of people, a lot of money -- literally.   \n\nBy the time I started THE TENDER FOR LAW, which to this day is the only place I publish under my own name, there were over fifty (50) different crypto-currencies in existence.  When I first started the group, Dean Clifford had just been ratified into the AQUILAE TRUST.   He was actually an administrator of this group, which brings me to this group.\n\nYou people are my only contact with the \"outside world\", and the minimal contact I've had with you in this insincere medium, has profoundly affected your lives.  As I ponder, while writing, I'm surprised at the number of names that are on this list.  I get an indescribable rush (that I don't quite understand yet) when you people benefit tangibly from what I have shown you.  Outside of this medium there are others who literally became millionaires over night.  Eighty percent of them crashed and burned, because they stopped listening to me.  That other twenty percent thought right, and valued the right things.  All of them feel they owe me a debt, even though they've paid their debt -- and I certainly don't want to discourage that!  If people want to feel gratitude, and have the urge to give me shit, I encourage them to do so.  Just make sure that shit is a consumable that everyone can use.   If I need anything else I can make/get it myself.   Again I digress...\n\nThis is about people starting to take me seriously.\n\nThe wrong people are starting to make the \"right\" connections.  There's nothing I can really do to stop it.  We live in a world right now, that has things humanity has never had before.  This very medium I'm talking to you on, will one day seem as antiquated as a console stereo seems today.  When computer science is at the core of who you are, all you do is look ahead at the possibilities - based on what exists right now.  These people have always existed.  They're just really well equipped now.  I can build things for less than $100 that would have cost thousands fewer than ten years ago.  In the time that my sister group - THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING - has existed, you've literally watched the evolution of the system-on-a-chip (SOC); and today the Raspberry Pi 0 is $5.  To purchase that capability in 1997, would have cost about $5,000.   These monster machines that form the core of who I am, are now commodities that can be bought for $5.  The time that I took advantage of that foresight I had, those many years ago which compelled me to pretend to be a retard, is a time that will never come again.  \n\nThis has caused the most distinct separation between you, the reader, and myself.  \n\nIn every way that matters we are \"equal\", in as much as we're both semi-evolved chimps that made it this far.  Both of us can buy a Pi 0 for $5.00.  Only one of us actually understand it.  It's my \"super-power\".  There's literally no computer I can't understand, and I find myself in the odd position of having to ask, \"What do I do with this super power?\"  It's only when your government leash-holders turned on me, that I decided CHANGE EVERYTHING was the answer.  It's one of the reasons I'm a rabid backer of OPEN SOURCE and FREE SOFTWARE.  This is an issue that none of you really understand, yet it will impact all of your lives.  You may not love computers as I do, or even have a desire to understand how they work.  Many of you are just happy enough to believe they're just \"magic 'pooter boxes\"...and that's it.  But it's YOUR RIGHT to understand.  You've heard me say before, that none of you really grasp what has been stolen from you, and I'm here to tell you, that this is one of the things that is BEING stolen from you.  The right to understand how this technology works is one of the most important things in your life today.  Yet none of you are even qualified to understand the issue at hand.  I hope I've painted a broad picture of it.  I'm sure I frighten you when I point out that your life is intimately tied to computer science, and none of you know anything about computer science.   \n\nThere are interests at play that want to remove that RIGHT from you.  They want to make this global ignorance a permanent state.  This is very serious, and it's why I won't charge money for software.  You idiots will post videos of a Rube Goldberg machine, guaranteed re-posts if it ends with something hitting a cat...but computer science is way beyond that, and the rules are very simple to understand.  Everything in the universe is ON or OFF, just like the real universe.  I've said it before.  I can speak to the universe, and it will speak back in numbers - numbers only computer science can understand.  As you're about to see, all of the above is connected.\n\nWhen people start taking you seriously when you make \"crazy claims\" such as \"collapse the banking system and start a war\", the first thing they'll attempt to do, is discredit you.  They, of course, have to resort to lying to accomplish it.  The strangest thing is, the people who perpetrate these lies are never called to account for the damage they do.   The recent Ghomeshi*  trial is an example of this.  For those unfamiliar with the case, a prominent Toronto broadcaster was very publicly charged with aggravated assault, and aggravated sexual assault, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison with the possibility of parole after twenty-five years.  This was some serious shit.  When the story broke, more \"victims\" came out to testify.  The Feminazis wanted to hang the guy on the spot.  The TL;DR of the trial was that this Toronto broadcaster like to do some fucked-up shit in bed, and three cunts thought it would be a good idea to lie about it.   During the trial, the Feminazis were there to show their support for these women that the Justice specifically said were lying.   That's the world in 2016.  These women deliberately lied in court, as they plotted in public on fucking Facebook.  \n\nI mention this because this is something I'm going to be dealing with soon.  Up until now, we had Menard and Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson lying about me publicly, and that's about it.  But I've been engaging LAWYERS publicly head-on, hitting them with the questions that will compel they to lie every time - and provably lie.   There are questions like, \"Does the LAW SOCIETY CLAIM OWNERSHIP of all INDIVIDUALS?\", and \"What does an ATTORNEY ATTORN?\"  Many of you have been eagerly watching these exchanges, mostly because I make you; and it surprises you every single time how quickly they start lying.  That's what lawyers do.  They lie.   It starts with the law degree itself.  The stereotypical Jewish mother wants her son to become a doctor or a lawyer.  Why does this stereotype exist?  Well, it's just something that \"everybody knows\".  As I've explained and shown you for years, when \"everybody knows\" something, it means there is a lot of money and a large-scale agenda at work.  By large-scale I mean time.  In this case it's an attempt to place the art of lying on the same level of respectability as the practice of medicine.  These are literally people who want to be associated with the STEM fields -- but with an art's degree.  Never forget that.  A law degree is an Art's Degree, like \"Gender Studies\", or \"Philosophy\".  \n\nSo remember that when you see your aunt, or brother, or cousin who is a lawyer.  These are 3's dressed up as 9's.  Everything about them is a lie.  It is important to remember that they chose this, and invested four long years learning the necessary memory and recitation rituals, that will get you that magic LAW DEGREE.  For the public record, I have two of them, and I did not get them under the name, Scott Duncan.  A computer scientist that studies law seems almost like a contradiction in terms.  I'm a man who had a life plan at the age of thirteen, because overnight, everything changed.  \n\nAs I approach the half century mark, all of you get even more and more confusing.  My companion throughout this entire journey was computer science itself, and the thing about computer science is that once you truly understand it, the nature of that understanding compels you to always look forward.  To look at the most mundane things with a computer attached to it...and see the infinite possibilities.  I'm certain to this day that you still don't understand what I mean when I say there are literally trillions of dollars worth of free shit just waiting to be exploited.  Open source and free software are your only legal protection from having your right to understand these magnificent machines, taken away from you - by strangers serving an agenda who don't give a shit about you.  \n\nSo that's pretty much my last gem for you before people start throwing shit at me.  \n\nRight now they're throwing the expendable, and the mentally ill, at me.  Agents through agency.  Somebody the cops have frightened.  Somebody who's going to court, and is hoping for leniency if they cooperate.  This gives the government plausible deniability, but it's just a matter of time before the agents themselves are deployed.  Until then there are feeble attempts to lie about me, in play, one of which is below for your consideration.   I have no idea what lies await, so I can't even preemptively defend myself against what's coming.   Who knows?  That fact that I'm posting this may even cause future plans to be aborted.  See, here's the thing.  The government's \"home turf\" is also my \"home turf\".  I was their property for three (3) years, and their mercenary for ten (10).  I was literally designed to harm you.  Your government did this.  It's practically instinct in me; and as compelling as that programming I received in those three years was/is, my brain literally had better things to do.  It allowed me to lay out a rough plan, one that I had to do alone - because you're all too stupid and love your bullshit too much.  That's why lying is so compelling for you.  There's literally an art's degree for lying, and substantial compensation for learning it well.  There is no such thing as a \"good lawyer\".  IT'S A FUCKING ARTS DEGREE FOR LYING!  If you know any lawyers, and they CLAIM not to know this, guess what....they're lying!  They've got the diploma on their wall to prove it.  TRUST but VERIFY.\n\nI had the good/mis fortune of calling a lawyer \"friend\".  His name was Steve Krupnick, and as promised at a later date, I shall tell the story of his son, Harrison, and his role in that last day which I'm sure still confuses him.  However, when I publish that, it's a bell I can't un-ring.  It will get a lot of attention globally, and I don't think Facebook should benefit from it directly.\n\nWhich brings me to the last subject which connects all of this.\n\nI'm talking about, of course, Diaspora.\n\nIf you're an avid follower of...well, me, you will note that historically my very first post on Facebook was the announcement of Diaspora going live.  Now I want everyone to look at the parallels between Diaspora and Bitcoin, because I gotta tell 'ya, I've gotten a lot of grief over the years about how crypto-currencies were a \"failure\".   It seemed like every month there was an announcement of the death of Bitcoin.   Well, the same thing is happening with Diaspora.  Wired magazine has announced, no fewer than three times, that the Diaspora project is a failure.   Yet here I am, still endorsing it like it's the next great thing.  \n\nUnlike cryptographic currencies that are literally selling you money, Diaspora is more of an idea.  It's an idea that I'm intimate with, and if deployed right and adopted by enough people, it will change everything, because we all collectively have the power to change Diaspora on the fly.  The idea behind Diaspora is that you decide what a social network is.   Because some douche came up with the concept of \"social network\", and the douches that adopted it seem to be the ones deciding for you.  I don't want to build these things for you.  I don't care if you ever understand your computer or not.  It's important to me that you always have the option of understanding.  That's what open/free software is all about.  You may not even know this is a right you want to protect, and that's how most of your rights are stolen.  They're stolen because you don't understand something.  This is basically how things are run.  Yes there are people who \"know all the secrets\", but they're not in charge of anything.  They're used until they are no longer useful, and then they're disposed of -- like any other commodity.  Virtually every system in the government is a sorting mechanism for that commodity, and as we begin our migration to Diaspora I'm going to explain to you in painstaking detail, how to navigate and exploit that mechanism.   What you do with that knowledge is entirely up to you.  Know ahead of time that the government loves to throw its \"agents\" under the bus, which they will most certainly do every time you leverage the things I'm about to show you on Diaspora.  \n\nBut that's for the future.  For now, people are going to start spending a lot of time and effort, doing nothing but lying about me.  These attacks are going to get more, and more vicious.  This one literally celebrates our victimization as lying about me didn't seem to be working.  Remember, lawyers don't care what you think of them.  They have their own \"society\", remember?  So what you think of them is functionally irrelevant.  The LAW SOCIETY literally considers you \"property\", but they rely on your ignorance.  If you could convey to cows at Burger King's cattle ranches what their owners have determined for them, I'm sure you'd get a stampede.  You'll notice I'm not directly pointing you to a location where you can confirm that lawyer's think this.  Instead I'm engaging the lawyers themselves, publicly, so you can see how they react.  Their reactions say way more than me pointing at the documentary evidence ever could.  Of all the things that aren't hidden, this one is the most hidden.  For here in reality, none of this is hidden.  That's how they get away with it.  Except, I'm telling everybody how everything works - and I'm signing my name to it.  \n\nI was a speciality commodity specifically designed to harm you.  But as much as I want to, I don't have the right, and neither do you...and neither do they.\n\nLet this serve as a synopsis of my time here.  Many of you see the writing on the wall at Facebook, and I'll be using Diaspora in much the same way.  My mark will be left by being the only one who used Facebook the way that I did.  I changed the conditions of the test.  That will always be my only vindication.  Let it also serve as advice.  If you ever find yourself in the position where you could change the conditions of the test, don't be afraid.  Do it!  If you don't, you'll regret it the rest of your life.  \n\nSo, anyway...here's somebody deliberately lying about me, and celebrating Judicial corruption. Common Sense The right to represent yourself, you say?  \n\nIt may or may not be presently apparent that one may represent one self as a fool.  As primarily one is presumed innocent.  Consider:  A constitutional duty of old was to seek out the idiot's.  Writ, de Idiota.    One may attribute Not Criminally Responsible as one area in law which derives from such considerations.  Nativitates and Non Compos Mentis lie within this writ's historical considerations as well, although Non Compos Mentis is more often determined.\n\nClaims can be denied.  Burden of Proof implies burdens.  When one claims a right, one loses a freedom.  Free presence.  Check your moves, mate.  \n\nSide note:  Claiming the right to remain silent would break the freedom.  Simples. "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_974204399282159","body":"Hey, Nakia Khantrell King, what up ? :) "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_972066906162575","body":"What's up Michele Carbello?

From Greek, dispersion, from diaspeirein; to scatter, from dia- + speirein to sowthe movement, migration, or scattering of a people away from an established or ancestral homeland.\n===============================================\n2016 has been an interesting year, so far.  I'm now at the phase of my initiative where people are starting to put some pieces together.  Those of you who have studied under me, are familiar with the ground rules of any large-scale operation.   The principle one is, \"While you're building, NEVER LET THEM TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY\"!\n\nUnfortunately this rule has now been broken, because people are now starting to take me seriously.  Most of 2010 was occupied with the ongoing research and development of cryptographic currencies.  One of the first things I set out to do, once cryptographic currencies turned out to be viable, was to seek out those who understood the legal ramifications of what was being built, and people who understand what money is.  I'm sad to say that in 2010, the only ones that were even qualified to hear what I had to say, were a few smart Libertarians and the FREE-DUMBERS.  I actively sought out Robert Menard.  This, of course, turned out to be a colossal failure.   While Menard was more than qualified, it didn't change the fact that he's a lying, drunk, con artist.   A year later, Dean Clifford sought me out.  He was more interested in the AQUILAE TRUST than he was in any fancy computer money.  Menard actually tried to \"mansplain\" that the whole purpose behind money is that you can \"buy things with it\", and made the ever popular comment, \"What if the server goes down?\"  It's the one thing I've noticed about the FREE-DUMBERS.  They really seem to hate technology.  Dean Clifford aggressively fought to avoid learning anything.  I point out to everyone who will listen, how intimately tied to computer science all of your lives are.  I've lived nearly half a century on this planet, and all the things I grew up with, are gone.  \n\nThere are no telephones.  There are computers pretending to be telephones.  There are no radios.  There are computers pretending to be radios.  There are no televisions.  There are computers pretending to be televisions.  To this day, I still get confused looks when I say that there are no cars; there are just rolling unsecured networks of computers, pretending to be cars.  It's a matter of PUBLIC RECORD that I literally pretended to be a \"retard\" so I could get access to computers.  I wasn't the only one.  His name was Peter Sheppard.  He had no interest in computer science.  He was just lazy and didn't want to do any actual school work, which I totally respected him for.   That action was one of my first \"practise what you preach\" exercises.  When you're smarter than everyone else around you, the opinions and perceptions of everyone else around you become irrelevant.   This was my first real-world exercise of this concept, and it's not as easy as I make it sound.  I was also fourteen years-old.  At the time there were a lot of factors working against my interest over which I had absolutely no control.  \n\nNow in 2016, I find myself in the unique position of understanding more than all of my fellow man.  This is not an arrogant declaration.  It is a fact.  I have simply dedicated more effort to the task than everybody else in history; because at that early age, I fell in love with computers.  At the time they were just simple enough for the average man to understand.   I could tell you exactly how a Commodore 64 CPU worked.  I have no fucking clue how an i7 works, but I do know from those fundamentals acquired in the early days, the things that must be true.  This means I can understand how an i7 works, should I choose to.  Is the Internet what I thought it would become in the old days?  Hell no!  Those few times I attempted to express to my family what it was I was doing, and studying, and spending my time on, they literally labelled me \"crazy\", and told everyone I was pretending to be part of a \"secret society\".   They just shrugged this off, as the by-product of having been sold to the government.  Yes, they really did that shit in the '70s; and only to people with \"Noble Lineage\".  I'll be covering that on Diaspora when our POD is ready....\n\n...but I digress...\n\nYou read the above and there's no way anyone reading this without context could think that these things are anything but the ramblings of a madman...except they're all true, and I've shown that they're all true, and I'm going to show more truth.  \n\nThese are truths you simply couldn't understand without acquiring the knowledge you've gained so far.  It's starting to happen.  People outside the LAW SOCIETY and the upper caste of the ATTORNEY GENERAL are starting to take me seriously.   I will admit that there is this latent fear that I'll wake up in the morning with Vice saying they totally found Satoshi Nakamoto this morning...honest...and a really bad picture from high school serving as the background.  But I think I'm ok.  I don't have much to worry about, because as I've said before, it's really difficult to sell somebody an idea.  It is, however, stupidly simple to sell them money.  I have made a lot of people, a lot of money -- literally.   \n\nBy the time I started THE TENDER FOR LAW, which to this day is the only place I publish under my own name, there were over fifty (50) different crypto-currencies in existence.  When I first started the group, Dean Clifford had just been ratified into the AQUILAE TRUST.   He was actually an administrator of this group, which brings me to this group.\n\nYou people are my only contact with the \"outside world\", and the minimal contact I've had with you in this insincere medium, has profoundly affected your lives.  As I ponder, while writing, I'm surprised at the number of names that are on this list.  I get an indescribable rush (that I don't quite understand yet) when you people benefit tangibly from what I have shown you.  Outside of this medium there are others who literally became millionaires over night.  Eighty percent of them crashed and burned, because they stopped listening to me.  That other twenty percent thought right, and valued the right things.  All of them feel they owe me a debt, even though they've paid their debt -- and I certainly don't want to discourage that!  If people want to feel gratitude, and have the urge to give me shit, I encourage them to do so.  Just make sure that shit is a consumable that everyone can use.   If I need anything else I can make/get it myself.   Again I digress...\n\nThis is about people starting to take me seriously.\n\nThe wrong people are starting to make the \"right\" connections.  There's nothing I can really do to stop it.  We live in a world right now, that has things humanity has never had before.  This very medium I'm talking to you on, will one day seem as antiquated as a console stereo seems today.  When computer science is at the core of who you are, all you do is look ahead at the possibilities - based on what exists right now.  These people have always existed.  They're just really well equipped now.  I can build things for less than $100 that would have cost thousands fewer than ten years ago.  In the time that my sister group - THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING - has existed, you've literally watched the evolution of the system-on-a-chip (SOC); and today the Raspberry Pi 0 is $5.  To purchase that capability in 1997, would have cost about $5,000.   These monster machines that form the core of who I am, are now commodities that can be bought for $5.  The time that I took advantage of that foresight I had, those many years ago which compelled me to pretend to be a retard, is a time that will never come again.  \n\nThis has caused the most distinct separation between you, the reader, and myself.  \n\nIn every way that matters we are \"equal\", in as much as we're both semi-evolved chimps that made it this far.  Both of us can buy a Pi 0 for $5.00.  Only one of us actually understand it.  It's my \"super-power\".  There's literally no computer I can't understand, and I find myself in the odd position of having to ask, \"What do I do with this super power?\"  It's only when your government leash-holders turned on me, that I decided CHANGE EVERYTHING was the answer.  It's one of the reasons I'm a rabid backer of OPEN SOURCE and FREE SOFTWARE.  This is an issue that none of you really understand, yet it will impact all of your lives.  You may not love computers as I do, or even have a desire to understand how they work.  Many of you are just happy enough to believe they're just \"magic 'pooter boxes\"...and that's it.  But it's YOUR RIGHT to understand.  You've heard me say before, that none of you really grasp what has been stolen from you, and I'm here to tell you, that this is one of the things that is BEING stolen from you.  The right to understand how this technology works is one of the most important things in your life today.  Yet none of you are even qualified to understand the issue at hand.  I hope I've painted a broad picture of it.  I'm sure I frighten you when I point out that your life is intimately tied to computer science, and none of you know anything about computer science.   \n\nThere are interests at play that want to remove that RIGHT from you.  They want to make this global ignorance a permanent state.  This is very serious, and it's why I won't charge money for software.  You idiots will post videos of a Rube Goldberg machine, guaranteed re-posts if it ends with something hitting a cat...but computer science is way beyond that, and the rules are very simple to understand.  Everything in the universe is ON or OFF, just like the real universe.  I've said it before.  I can speak to the universe, and it will speak back in numbers - numbers only computer science can understand.  As you're about to see, all of the above is connected.\n\nWhen people start taking you seriously when you make \"crazy claims\" such as \"collapse the banking system and start a war\", the first thing they'll attempt to do, is discredit you.  They, of course, have to resort to lying to accomplish it.  The strangest thing is, the people who perpetrate these lies are never called to account for the damage they do.   The recent Ghomeshi*  trial is an example of this.  For those unfamiliar with the case, a prominent Toronto broadcaster was very publicly charged with aggravated assault, and aggravated sexual assault, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison with the possibility of parole after twenty-five years.  This was some serious shit.  When the story broke, more \"victims\" came out to testify.  The Feminazis wanted to hang the guy on the spot.  The TL;DR of the trial was that this Toronto broadcaster like to do some fucked-up shit in bed, and three cunts thought it would be a good idea to lie about it.   During the trial, the Feminazis were there to show their support for these women that the Justice specifically said were lying.   That's the world in 2016.  These women deliberately lied in court, as they plotted in public on fucking Facebook.  \n\nI mention this because this is something I'm going to be dealing with soon.  Up until now, we had Menard and Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson lying about me publicly, and that's about it.  But I've been engaging LAWYERS publicly head-on, hitting them with the questions that will compel they to lie every time - and provably lie.   There are questions like, \"Does the LAW SOCIETY CLAIM OWNERSHIP of all INDIVIDUALS?\", and \"What does an ATTORNEY ATTORN?\"  Many of you have been eagerly watching these exchanges, mostly because I make you; and it surprises you every single time how quickly they start lying.  That's what lawyers do.  They lie.   It starts with the law degree itself.  The stereotypical Jewish mother wants her son to become a doctor or a lawyer.  Why does this stereotype exist?  Well, it's just something that \"everybody knows\".  As I've explained and shown you for years, when \"everybody knows\" something, it means there is a lot of money and a large-scale agenda at work.  By large-scale I mean time.  In this case it's an attempt to place the art of lying on the same level of respectability as the practice of medicine.  These are literally people who want to be associated with the STEM fields -- but with an art's degree.  Never forget that.  A law degree is an Art's Degree, like \"Gender Studies\", or \"Philosophy\".  \n\nSo remember that when you see your aunt, or brother, or cousin who is a lawyer.  These are 3's dressed up as 9's.  Everything about them is a lie.  It is important to remember that they chose this, and invested four long years learning the necessary memory and recitation rituals, that will get you that magic LAW DEGREE.  For the public record, I have two of them, and I did not get them under the name, Scott Duncan.  A computer scientist that studies law seems almost like a contradiction in terms.  I'm a man who had a life plan at the age of thirteen, because overnight, everything changed.  \n\nAs I approach the half century mark, all of you get even more and more confusing.  My companion throughout this entire journey was computer science itself, and the thing about computer science is that once you truly understand it, the nature of that understanding compels you to always look forward.  To look at the most mundane things with a computer attached to it...and see the infinite possibilities.  I'm certain to this day that you still don't understand what I mean when I say there are literally trillions of dollars worth of free shit just waiting to be exploited.  Open source and free software are your only legal protection from having your right to understand these magnificent machines, taken away from you - by strangers serving an agenda who don't give a shit about you.  \n\nSo that's pretty much my last gem for you before people start throwing shit at me.  \n\nRight now they're throwing the expendable, and the mentally ill, at me.  Agents through agency.  Somebody the cops have frightened.  Somebody who's going to court, and is hoping for leniency if they cooperate.  This gives the government plausible deniability, but it's just a matter of time before the agents themselves are deployed.  Until then there are feeble attempts to lie about me, in play, one of which is below for your consideration.   I have no idea what lies await, so I can't even preemptively defend myself against what's coming.   Who knows?  That fact that I'm posting this may even cause future plans to be aborted.  See, here's the thing.  The government's \"home turf\" is also my \"home turf\".  I was their property for three (3) years, and their mercenary for ten (10).  I was literally designed to harm you.  Your government did this.  It's practically instinct in me; and as compelling as that programming I received in those three years was/is, my brain literally had better things to do.  It allowed me to lay out a rough plan, one that I had to do alone - because you're all too stupid and love your bullshit too much.  That's why lying is so compelling for you.  There's literally an art's degree for lying, and substantial compensation for learning it well.  There is no such thing as a \"good lawyer\".  IT'S A FUCKING ARTS DEGREE FOR LYING!  If you know any lawyers, and they CLAIM not to know this, guess what....they're lying!  They've got the diploma on their wall to prove it.  TRUST but VERIFY.\n\nI had the good/mis fortune of calling a lawyer \"friend\".  His name was Steve Krupnick, and as promised at a later date, I shall tell the story of his son, Harrison, and his role in that last day which I'm sure still confuses him.  However, when I publish that, it's a bell I can't un-ring.  It will get a lot of attention globally, and I don't think Facebook should benefit from it directly.\n\nWhich brings me to the last subject which connects all of this.\n\nI'm talking about, of course, Diaspora.\n\nIf you're an avid follower of...well, me, you will note that historically my very first post on Facebook was the announcement of Diaspora going live.  Now I want everyone to look at the parallels between Diaspora and Bitcoin, because I gotta tell 'ya, I've gotten a lot of grief over the years about how crypto-currencies were a \"failure\".   It seemed like every month there was an announcement of the death of Bitcoin.   Well, the same thing is happening with Diaspora.  Wired magazine has announced, no fewer than three times, that the Diaspora project is a failure.   Yet here I am, still endorsing it like it's the next great thing.  \n\nUnlike cryptographic currencies that are literally selling you money, Diaspora is more of an idea.  It's an idea that I'm intimate with, and if deployed right and adopted by enough people, it will change everything, because we all collectively have the power to change Diaspora on the fly.  The idea behind Diaspora is that you decide what a social network is.   Because some douche came up with the concept of \"social network\", and the douches that adopted it seem to be the ones deciding for you.  I don't want to build these things for you.  I don't care if you ever understand your computer or not.  It's important to me that you always have the option of understanding.  That's what open/free software is all about.  You may not even know this is a right you want to protect, and that's how most of your rights are stolen.  They're stolen because you don't understand something.  This is basically how things are run.  Yes there are people who \"know all the secrets\", but they're not in charge of anything.  They're used until they are no longer useful, and then they're disposed of -- like any other commodity.  Virtually every system in the government is a sorting mechanism for that commodity, and as we begin our migration to Diaspora I'm going to explain to you in painstaking detail, how to navigate and exploit that mechanism.   What you do with that knowledge is entirely up to you.  Know ahead of time that the government loves to throw its \"agents\" under the bus, which they will most certainly do every time you leverage the things I'm about to show you on Diaspora.  \n\nBut that's for the future.  For now, people are going to start spending a lot of time and effort, doing nothing but lying about me.  These attacks are going to get more, and more vicious.  This one literally celebrates our victimization as lying about me didn't seem to be working.  Remember, lawyers don't care what you think of them.  They have their own \"society\", remember?  So what you think of them is functionally irrelevant.  The LAW SOCIETY literally considers you \"property\", but they rely on your ignorance.  If you could convey to cows at Burger King's cattle ranches what their owners have determined for them, I'm sure you'd get a stampede.  You'll notice I'm not directly pointing you to a location where you can confirm that lawyer's think this.  Instead I'm engaging the lawyers themselves, publicly, so you can see how they react.  Their reactions say way more than me pointing at the documentary evidence ever could.  Of all the things that aren't hidden, this one is the most hidden.  For here in reality, none of this is hidden.  That's how they get away with it.  Except, I'm telling everybody how everything works - and I'm signing my name to it.  \n\nI was a speciality commodity specifically designed to harm you.  But as much as I want to, I don't have the right, and neither do you...and neither do they.\n\nLet this serve as a synopsis of my time here.  Many of you see the writing on the wall at Facebook, and I'll be using Diaspora in much the same way.  My mark will be left by being the only one who used Facebook the way that I did.  I changed the conditions of the test.  That will always be my only vindication.  Let it also serve as advice.  If you ever find yourself in the position where you could change the conditions of the test, don't be afraid.  Do it!  If you don't, you'll regret it the rest of your life.  \n\nSo, anyway...here's somebody deliberately lying about me, and celebrating Judicial corruption.\n\n[Cowards deleted the post]\n\n...so instead, let's look a a tread where MOST of the participants now hate me because \"reasons\".\n\nGail Marie = 2-faced cunt.\nAdam Thomas = Well, Adam thomas\n\n..and a whole lot of others.\n\nLook how \"grateful\" they all are. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/tenderforlaw/permalink/532494196786517/ "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_977905528912046","body":"Scott says we haven't targeted lawyers enough, so I'm picking up the ball.  I thought I'd go on a brief exploration to see if I can find some accessible examples of how lawyers victimize people.  Before I begin, let's recap what we know about lawyers.\n\n#1:  A law degree is an ARTS degree (like Gender Studies, or Philosophy) - and like Gender Studies and Philosophy, there is no requirement for actual knowledge or skill.  It only requires \"belief\".  As we know, all belief is evil.  Therefore these fields of study are evil, and lawyers, by their very nature, are evil.  Every single one of them is in this category.  There are no exceptions to this rule.\n\n#2:  A lawyer's oath is to THE LAW SOCIETY.  It is, and always will be, their primary obligation.  Their only obligation to their \"clients\" is to maintain their integrity, until all the new money generated by their case has been paid out.\n\n#3:  Fees to a lawyer are only part of what they get paid.  Every time they submit a document to the court with the ATTORNEY GENERAL as TRUSTEE, and that document has one signature on it, they are sending a BILL.  If the document has two signatures and a TRUSTEE (ATTORNEY GENERAL), it is a BILL OF EXCHANGE.  Think about it.  LEGALLY, that's all it can be, and when dealing with lawyers, LEGAL is all that matters.  Lawyers will always try to pretend they are using the common definition of words, instead of the LEGAL definition of words.  \n\n#4:  Win or lose, the lawyer gets paid.  They have no incentive either way.  In JURISDICTIONS like ONTARIO where the loser pays, it doesn't apply to the lawyer.  Losing a case has absolutely no economic effect, or any other effect, on a lawyer.  There are no lawyers that \"care\" about any cause you have hired them for.  There never has been, and there never will be, despite what television tells you.  \n\nIt didn't take me long to find this particular victim.  She's effectively \"down the hall\" in Vernon Beck's \"Canada Court Watch\" group.  Unfortunately Vernon Beck is one of these poor, deluded souls, that thinks the system can be fixed from the inside; and he's always \"making progress\" while entire years of interaction with children are being robbed from people.  Scott has apparently explained to him that at no time in history, has \"fix it from the inside\" ever worked.  Reading the group, you can see Vernon clearly thinks strangers in dresses, and magic parchments, still have \"authority\".  He'll be on his death bed before he realizes any of us are correct....but this post isn't about him.  This is about a poor woman who's being led down the proverbial garden path by a lawyer, and she's just coming to an ugly realization.   She's pleading for help - where there is none - and it's a heartbreaking read, so be warned.\nThen remember the thousands of people who participate in this, every single one of them believing it's their right to do so...because a lawyer said it to them.\n\nIf you think Scott's position, that it is is morally and ethically sound to cut out the eyes, and cut off the thumbs of lawyers, is over the top, I can guarantee you that this woman disagrees.  And, she was one of those who could afford a lawyer.  Try to imagine the children's lives that are ruined by lawyers coming after those that can't afford a lawyer; because there's certainly a heavy financial incentive to do so, especially for the government.  In the end, LEGAL is just the law of ACCOUNTING and SURETY.   Pretending it's anything other than that, is the first lie lawyers try to see you.  They don't want you to know this, and they'd really prefer it if you were credulous and believed in magic sky-daddies, because then they can leverage that ARTS degree in lying, and you're likely to believe it.  \n\nRead this woman's story and tell me Scott Duncan's views on lawyers are \"extreme\". I dare you. Julie HELP!!!!!!!\nSO some people know my case as its been going on for almost 6 years. I will give you a brief history.\nI was in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic. He threatened to kill me and I went to police and because of his behavior and things he was doing police advised me to leave immediately before he killed me and to get my children out of the house. \nSo I left and my ex never requested to see the boys or bothered for months. Then we went to court and I had my children taken away. This was the start of denied access and the loss of my children. The OCL became involved and my boys fought to get out of the house and at 9 and 14 to start their voices were never heard. They threatened their dad they would call CAS if he didn't let them come live with me. The OCL report stated how abusive he was, the boys fear of him, he coaches them on what to say and they were afraid he would hit them like he did their sister. Their older sister was put into foster care at the age of 14 because of his abuse towards her as well.\nI had a lawyer at the time and he dismissed himself stating to me he has never seen anything like this before and knew he couldn't help me. The judges in Guelph gave my ex whatever he wanted and all the broken court orders and my ex's behavior, not to mention the boys wishes were ignored. \nJust to remind you this is happening because my ex husbands mother works within this small courthouse as a court services officer and she works along side the judges, especially Justice Belleghem and Justice Price.\nIn 2012 during a case conference with the Judge assigned for this, Justice Mossip she seen through what was happening. She made my ex husband cry with her take on everything he was doing and how bad of a father he was. She forced him to give me back the boys.\nThey came to live with me and the boys were happy again. Although he continued with his abusive ways and threats even to the point the OCL's boss acknowledged an abusive incident to me through email although they felt it wasn't a child protective issue. My younger son starting throwing up before visits and the older one didn't want to go either. The older one in highschool at this time. They were forced to go.\nA few months later I was admitted into hospital and my mom came to watch the boys. She dropped them off for their weekend visit and he then refused to return the boys and was in court two days later with the help of his mom, no OCL present and had all my parental rights removed based on fabrications and nothing that he could substantiate. \nJust to point out at the beginning when I had no source of income and had the boys for 6 months he was never made to pay child support or spousal support although he has a high income. Again in 2012 he was never made to paid child support either because he didn't feel like it. I was only working part time when I won them back.\nSO February 2013 when he stole them back he was given a cost award and child support based on amount my ex husband thought I should make. For the next year he denied all communication, against a court order again and I was left living off $800 monthly. I would have been homeless if it wasn't for my mom's help. I'm a nurse just to point out and do now work full time.The Ontario Law that you cannot deduct more than 50% of someone's net pay did not apply in my case. Also the fact that I was off work until the following January.\nFinally in the fall 2013 I brought a motion after several attempts as this Superior Court in Guelph informed me I was not allowed to file motions against him. I had to contact the Director of Court Operations in order to do so. I finally was able to see a judge and she wrote on the court order I was paying way to much in child support, although didn't award it back to me just lowered it. She also gave me back access to my boys which he still denied anyway. I brought Contempt Motions and all ignored the Judges wouldn't even read them and put them aside.\nBy January 2014 my younger son phoned me and begged me to come get him as his dad was mean. I phoned his dad who we don't ever speak. He was drunk and I recorded this call, transcribed it and it was accepted into court for the trial. He was cocky and kept belittling me in front of the boys. He said he would go to trial because he already knew he would win, he had no worries.\nI brought motions to change venue and those all denied and written in an order that his mother just was not allowed to touch our file.\nStill no access and trial mangement conferences they manipulated the judges and ensured we could not have Justice Mossip who was assigned because she wouldn't do what they wanted so they made sure it was Justice Price.\nDuring a conference to set the trial date we ended up having Justice Herold who informed me that the OCL and opposing council had been setting up a trial without my knowledge so I wouldn't show up. He had a few words for the OCl and opposing side. He said due to the nature of the case which he has read evidence he was going to appoint himself to do the trial and he looked at me and said the boys would be given back where they belong, with me.\nA day before trial I got a phone call from the courthouse and they were delaying the trial by a day. This was because they appointed Justice Herold into a different case so they could have their beloved Justice Belleghem. As soon as he walked in he looked at me and said I would not win and he would be careful how he worded his endorsement incase I appealed his decision. The trial was reduculous and Justice Belleghem reminded me daily I would not win, he was rude not only to me but my witnesses.\nDuring cross examination I was able to go through 90% of my evidence but he allowed the opposing side to drag the trial out to 7 days by this time. My ex husband admitted on the stand that he refused me access and he admitted it all. He even said he knew I was a good mother and the boys were well taken care of when in my care. BUt he didn't want me to see them.\nWe had assets including RRSP's, Pensions etc. I requested spousal support and child support retro for what was owing to me.\nIn September 2014 his decision came out and he gave my ex husband everything. I was left with no assets and child support paid to me, no spousal support and he awarded my ex husband child support based on a much higher amount then what I actually make annually. Plus $25,000 in court fees was awarded and $10,000 awarded as child support.\nI appealed the decision. In February 2015 I brought a motion in Divisional Court in Brampton and to my surprise if Justice Price didn't walk in. A Guelph Judge really! He was rude and ignored why I brought the motion and only concentrated on opposing council who was requesting the appeal be moved to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. At this time circumstances had changed and I moved back to town down the street from my ex and the boys were always at my place. Also I had found out our older son was not living with his dad and hadn't been since he was forced back in 2013, he was living with a friend. He started staying with me and officially moved all his stuff in with me by April. Justice Price ignored everything. The only thing I got that day was a stay put on the $25,000 cost award.\nThey were awarded for the case to be moved to the Court of Appeal. Justice Price wrote a date on the order that the appeal was to be filed with the Court of Appeal and funny the file never got transferred there. I made trips to the Divisional Court and they somehow lost my file. Finally one day I wouldn't leave their counter until someone found the file because I had by this time one week left to complete the appeal. They finally found it and apolagized and said they just don't know how it got misplaced. Corruption at its finest.\nIt was a good thing I did my research because the Court of Appeal received the file with 3 days remianing for me to perfect my appeal. Although that day it was complete and I didn't have to fix anything.\nIn June I brought a motion to the Court of Appeal and my older son appeared with me. The Judge was very annoyed that Justice Price did not deal with the issues in February. He had duty council contact his office and inform him of this. It is written in the order that Justice Price was contacted and agreed to call a conference to deal with the issues. Well within a week Justice Price recused himself due to the conflict of interest and stated I could just go back to Guelph. Justice Price was the Judge who took my kids away and all parental rights in 2013, now recuses himself.\nSo I pleaded with the Appeal Court to give me a speedy hearing due to the circumstances and they agreed to the beginning of September 2015. That is until the OCL decided to involve themselves after the appeal was perfected. They had a conference call and the Judge was very rude to me and ordered me to copy everything and I had to serve her. She requested from the court that the hearing be delayed. She was called in by my ex husband to help him. The hearing then got set to November. \nNovember came and we sat there all day as we were going to be the last case. Once the Justices spoke to me and they said \"are you ready\" the OCL stood up and said there was a problem. She filed material and sadly I was never served. Exactly what they had been doing because they didn't want those Judges. The case was then remanded until December.\nMy ex husband didn't even show up and the Judges had nothing to say to me and just let me talk and only reminded me when I had a few minutes left. \nWhen it was there turn they had lots of questions in regards to how much money they wanted etc. Oh and all the OCL documents they filed she was defending my ex husband. Nothing about the boys, she requested evidence be removed etc.\nIt took only 3 days with 5 years of evidence and the Judges came back with they agreed with everything Justice Belleghem did and were dismissing my appeal although they accept my ex husbands cross appeal for more money in child support and $10,000 awarded in costs.\n\n3 DAYS!!!!!\n\nThey completely ignored the evidence that my son has lived with me throughout the entire year. He was expelled from school which I brought documentation from the school, although my ex husband filed a affidavit stating my son lives with him full time as he stays there 1-2 nights a week and he attends school full time and thriving. His word against documentation from the school. As well I had evidence from my apt management that my son lives here full time and a letter written by my son about the misrepresentation by the OCL and she did not disclose what he and his brother wanted. I lost everything.\n\nI sent a formal 136 page complaint to the Law Society with all the evidence and they requested in January the Appeal Material. They just sent me a letter and acknowledged all the corruption and things done wrong although in the last paragraph they state they don't see anything was done wrong and they are closing the case. I wrote a complaint to the Judicial Council and they dismissed it as well against Justice Beleghem.\n\nSO now here I am and the garnishments are starting. All of my pay which will put me in a shelter. My son has lived here for over a year and he was awarded child support based on an amount I don't make and I provided my income tax assessments, they didn't care it was what my ex requested in child support. Plus although the $25,000 cost award was stayed, opposing council was asked what they wanted and it was never reinstated and not asked for. Now my ex is trying to collect.\nMy older son is also over 18 now and working. My ex husband continues to state my son lives there and is in school full time.\n\nHERE IS MY PROBLEM PLEASE HELP!!!!\n\nI found some funds so I obtain a lawyer to fix this child support and cost awards as its undue hardship and I will be living in a shelter. Its fraud and he won't stop.\nI can show his lies in a sworn affidavit and documentation from the school. I have a letter from the management here that our son lives here as well I have all the receipts for clothes and food etc.\nI have contacted law firms from Toronto etc and not one firm will take on my case. They say its too complex and they won't step foot in the Guelph courthouse.\n\nSo how am I suppose to have my Rights and Freedoms, My right to a fair trial etc... All my Human Rights have been taken away. I can't obtain any help and when I email his lawyer with the fact he is committing fraud his lawyer refuses to respond. His lawyer has a duty of care but because I'm self represented they just ignore me. I don't have any court orders with signatures or seals because they won't give me one.\n\nANYHELP ON WHAT TO DO. I NEED TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE PUTS ME IN A SHELTER. AN EMERGENCY MOTION NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT ASAP TO STOP THIS. I HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND PROOF REQUIRED BUT NO LAW FIRM WILL HELP.\n\nI guess its true what they say, lawyers only care about money. None of them actually care about what they took an oath for, to stand up for the law and help people. They are all too afraid to stand up for what is right??? I need someone who will blow the shit off that corrupt courthouse and their corrupt judges!\n\nNone exist I guess!

Not much to be done there.\n\nWhat we do agree on, is that established rules should be both voluntary and morally right. It's that last part (morals) we disagree on.\n\nPeople have a hard time grasping my political ideology because they don't actually know anything :/\n\nWhen it comes to commerce, I am an Anarcho Capitalist.\nWhen it comes to knowledge, I am a Marxist\nAbove all I am a humanist, and a scientist in equal portions.\n\nIt leads to the truth faster.\n\nIf it's TRUE, it doesn't matter who says it. Larken Rose doesn't like me, but I like him, very much. He stands for what he BELIEVES to be true. He harms NOBODY and does NOT advocate violence except in self-defense. He is very public with his views and will even change them when he sees sufficient evidence to warrant doing so.\n\nHe is ALWAYS asking EVERY \"authority\" this one question. He's done it for YEARS. He's doing it again here, and I want to encourage the asking of this question, because it is the program you have in your head, that avoids  the answer, because there is a LOT of bullshit attached to it, and answering \"no\" destroys ANY \"moral\" ground you may have, is always running.\n\n \"If you believe that it is morally wrong for YOU to do a certain thing yourself, can you make it morally right for someone else to do the same thing\"?\n\nOBVIOUSLY the answer is NO. It cannot BE anything else, and the second you start making excuses for answering \"yes\", I am, by default, BETTER THAN YOU.\n\nLarken Rose is RIGHT here. Nothing you say, think, feel, or believe, will change that. \n\nNow ask a Government Worker that same question. Larken Rose In writing and recording the script for \"The Mirror,\" the main challenge is not just accurately expressing a concept or question, but carefully shutting off all the \"escape routes\" that the human brain uses to AVOID thinking about something unfamiliar or uncomfortable. And the human mind is very creative and resourceful when it comes to making up excuses for NOT considering something that causes cognitive dissonance. Consider a question as simple as this: \"If you believe that it is morally wrong for YOU to do a certain thing yourself, can you make it morally right for someone else to do the same thing?\"\n\nIf someone's mind is relaxed, clear, and being honest, the concept is simple and the answer self-evident. But if someone knows where the question is headed, and is scared of facing the logical conclusion at the other end, then the brain--often subconsciously--will start to do the weirdest gymnastics and evasions, such as:\n\n1) Ignore the question and bring up some unrelated concern, such as: \"But how would we care for the poor?\"\n\n2) Intentionally \"misunderstand\" the question (even if only subconsciously): \"I can hire a plumber who can do my plumbing when I can't.\"\n\n3) Fish for some excuse for avoiding the obvious answer: \"Well a football team can delegate to the quarterback the right to call what play will be run when other people on the team have no such right.\"\n\n4) Argue about semantics: \"What do you mean by 'moral'?\" (I always respond, \"However YOU define and determine morality.\") \n\n5) Admit the obvious answer but then quickly try to change the subject: \"Well no, but that's not how government works!\"\n\nWhy is it so hard to just say, \"No, if I don't have the right to do something, I obviously can't give someone else the right to do it\"? Because... COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.\n\n(P.S. If you need me to point out why any of those five responses are irrelevant and irrational, let me know.)

In the beginning I BELIEVED that by just \"feeling thankful\" or \"giving thanks\" to Scott I was actually \"doing something good.\" \n\nLater (3 years after being part of this group), I started to actually think with the new information I had acquired here. It was then I realized how evil, and insulting a \"thank you\" really is. It's part of the program given to us, and it's fed by social discourse, and our own delusions. \n\n\"Thank you\" is a way of \"feeling\" that by just saying nice magical words, you have actually repaid a debt for something someone else did for you, or gave you. And guess were that program comes from, on this part of the hemisphere? The Bible! The whole \"giving thanks\" part of the Bible, now will probably be seen by a few quite differently. \"Thank you\" turns you into an ungrateful piece of shit. It also infuses a sense of false entitlement. \n\nLook/observe at nature. A tree gets it's nutrients from the soil. The tree grows leaves, flowers, and fruit that then fall into the ground. Animals, and insects eat some of that organic material, then poop. Then all this organic material mixes and decomposes, turning into nutrients that return to the soil, that trees get again. It's a give, take, and give back constantly. And the cycle goes on.\n\nWhat would happen if the tree just gets the nutrients from the soil, but then decides to not return any leaves, flowers, or fruit back to it? What if the tree just says to the soil \"Thank you! \"God\" bless you, and may \"god\" repay you for all the nutrients!\" It would disturb nature. You stop the flow. In the end, it's bad for everyone.\n\nBut I digress... Once I realized this, I stared thinking that I could only repay a debt by actually doing something to repay it, not just feel entitled, and throw the old \"thank you/fuck you.\" \n\nIt turns out that reading a thread Scott mentions exactly how to repay the debt owed to him. As we all know, it wasn't money that he was/is asking for. We have NOTHING of value to him.  But he did mentioned that if you wanted to \"show your thanks,\" the way was/is to ask government officials, and Law Society, specific questions, sending notices via registered mail. And should they not answer, make it public by publishing those notices in the Legal Notices Section of the local newspaper. \n\nFor example, \"Can I use the SECURITY of my PERSON to DISCHARGE PUBLIC DEBTS?\" Or, you may ask the Law Society \"What does an attorney attorns?\"\n\nShort, and simple. Don't give them 20 fucking questions. Stick to ONE question, and have them answer it in writing, via registered mail only. Do not accept any other type of correspondence, as it will probably lead to JOINDER, and you may deem this as unacceptable. \n\nThere are many readers, all at different levels of understanding. Some have been here long, some have a couple of years, and some are new. If you do not understand what you are doing, why you are doing it, and how to do it, it means you need to read more, in order to do anything. Do not be an idiot, and start doing shit if you do not know. It is really not complicated, but I make the warning for the happy trigger \"I want to look cool\" morons out there, that start sending crap, without having a fucking clue of what they are doing. Oh yes, I KNOW you are out there reading!\n\nAll of Scott's articles come to mind. PROPER NOTICE FOR IDIOTS is one of them. How to write a notice, for idiots, literally. And Pete Daoust has also examples of simple, and short communications asking questions like \"Can I use the SECURITY of my PERSON to DISCHARGE PUBLIC DEBTS?\" Check him out for a \"dumbed-down\" lay down.\n\nI want to make the note that it's human, and shows empathy, to be appreciative of others. But we must demonstrate our gratitude by repaying the debt, instead of believing a \"thank you\" will do.\n\nAt the end, asking these questions will only help you, not Scott. Asking these questions should make you think. Why is it that you are asking them? That may lead you to a quest for the TRUTH. Spoiler alert: there is codified SLAVERY in place! \n\nSo there you go. You want to \"thank Scott\" or show your gratitude? Now you know what \"thanks\" means, and what to actually do to show your gratitude.

The mother of the child was called as a WITNESS for the State, of course, to use her TESTIMONY as EVIDENCE against the father, and her. \n\nFor days vans, personnel from Family and Child Dept,. and police have been going to the house every day, trying to interview them, but they wisely declined every invitation with \"I am not authorized to answer any questions,\" and then just leave, and kept minding their own business. \"Authorities\" did not like that, so they issued that invitation, under the thread of contempt to answer questions.\n\nAlthough they had been advised by a lawyer to go in there and answer questions, and give them \"as little as they could\" (whatever that means), they took the wise teachings of Scott to NEVER answer questions, and give them questions.\n\nSo the mother walked into the prosecutor's office, and shitting in her pants she repeated like a mantra \"I am not authorized to answer any questions. I do not understand the nature, and cause of these proceedings. Have I made my wishes clear?\" She said she repeated this so much, even the prosecutors would chant it with her. They mocked her, told her that as a witness she did not have a right not to answer questions, threaten her, bullied her. She said it was humiliating.\n\nThen they asked her to sign a DECLARATION. At that point she called me on the phone, and I told her to NEVER give her signature to anything they give her. While all this was happening, the Family and Child Dept. had a van, and personnel in front of the house where they thought the child was. Waiting in stand-by.\n\nShe told them she did not wish to sign any declaration, and asked if she was free to go. After hours of being there, they replied she did not have to sign if it was not her wish, and that she was free to go.\n\nAs soon as that happened, the van, and personnel left their house.

It's the mechanism for how these law society scum take an endorsement and turn it into an order that is important to pay attention to. \n\nThese lawyers even ask for your CONSENT beforehand. I'm serious. Our (former) lawyer, Mr. Howard Cohen (http://www.cohensabsay.com), claimed that he presented us with the draft as a \"courtesy\". We all know that this officer of the court extending a a courtesy to me means I'm the one getting fucked. I even told him as much :D  \n\nMr. Cohen's LIE was to imply that my consent was a formality and/or not \"necessary\". It is worth noting that the endorsement of the Justice did not magically become an \"order\" because the Trustees did not sign. :D\n\nI am posting this after Anibal Jose Baez reminded the group that an \"Order\" can be VOIDed. I will share images of the \"Endorsement\" written by Mr. Justice Barnes and the \"Draft Order\" prepared by Ms. Howes to be sure I VOID this order correctly. \n\nI may be mistaken but it seems it only becomes an \"order\" when I SIGN. It seems counter intuitive that I would be asked to CONSENT to an order. I'm being asked to CONSENT to my own rape. :/ Is this what Gail Marie missed Scott?\n\nI would never have asked \"What is the mechanism?\" had I only focussed on the data. YOU CAN'T UNLEARN what Scott teaches. \n\n18th May 2016\n\nWITHOUT PREJUDICE\n\nKathleen A. Howes\nUnifor Legal Services Plan\n23 Regan Road\nBrampton, Ontario\nL7A 1B2\n\nMs. Howes, \n\nA smart man told me that a signature represents CONSENT and UNDERSTANDING. It can’t be anything else. \n\nThe executors have expressed repeatedly that we do not consent to these proceedings and that we respond under protest, threat and duress only. Compelling us to respond under these circumstances does not change this fact.\n\nOn August 20th, 2015 Ms. Justice Meredith Donohue declared that the consent of the executors “is not required for this proceeding”. While this declaration is both offensive and unacceptable, if it is true, then it is only reasonable to conclude that since our consent is not required then our signatures are not required either. Therefore, in keeping with her declaration, the “Draft Order” that you forwarded to the executors is being respectfully returned, unsigned, with this response. \n\nShould I be mistaken, and the executors have no choice but to sign this “draft order”, then we will cooperate since it is only reasonable to conclude that we are the property of the Attorney General, these courts and/or the Law Society. All that I require is written proof of this from the Attorney General and/or a Justice and/or the Law Society and we will sign immediately. \n\nOtherwise bring guns. A thief doesn’t ask me for permission to take my property, so let’s abandon all pretenses and call it for what it is. If I am being compelled to sign, under threat of financial and/or physical harm, then bring guns and I will cooperate with your “request”, but I will not willingly provide my consent. \n\nThe executors also do not understand the endorsement written by Mr. Justice Kofi Barnes given that the January 8th, 2016 transcript that I filed reveals that his spoken words contradict his “endorsement”. Perhaps Ms. \"Deputy Justice\" Kathleen Howes should seek clarification from her colleague. \n\nOne more thing, Scott Duncan says “Hello!” \n\nSincerely,\n\nBy: David-Paul, Executor for the Estate of DAVID PAUL SIP\n       ALL RIGHTS RESERVED "},{"post_id":"462493170453287_998419453527320","body":"Ok, please do not consider this as defamation or anything like that.

I look around. I see the back of Pete’s Head.... i’m at the right place! :)  So i sit down!  Then the judge arrives seconds later, i must stand up, like the others (i guess!?!). My first time in more than 20 years in that kind of places, i don’t really remember the last time and i don’t want to make any troubles so i do as they do.... i feel like i’m at the church when i was a young child..... sit down, get up, sit down.... on your knees, sing a song!!!  :/\nThey are calling the cases by numbers... Pete’s case is one of the lasts ones. They (The judge, The lawyer and Pete) talked a little bit about an affidavit from Ville de Terrebonne that came on the late and the judge send them outside to talk in some ‘’private room’’ and try to set the case. I follow Pete and his friends. They got close to a room that seems to fit them so i sit close to it. Pete and the lawyer get in the room but there’s some trouble as they enter the room; Pete’s witnesses can’t enter the room! I see some ‘’fighting’’ to close the door from the inside and open it from the outside! Finally Pete and the lawyer exit the room and i hear the lawyer saying: ‘’There's nothing i can do if you don’t want to talk’’ And Pete answering something like: ‘’I WANT to talk to you. We’ll do it right here (in public) if my witnesses can’t enter the room, i have no problem with that.’’ Finally they all (but me) enter the room; Pete, the lawyer and two other dudes. Few minutes later the lawyer get out of the ‘’private room’’ mumbling something i can’t hear but he look pissed and he’s kind of reddish!! Pete and the 2 other dude get out as well and they all get back to the court room... i follow them! \nSecond round. Pretty much all the cases are being set easily. All’s seems to get going very well... then come Pete’s turn! They are saying that the little chat in the ‘’private room’’ didn’t had any beneficial effect to set the case. Pete wants the original BoE, the lawyer don’t have them. Reason: they digitized them so they didn’t kept the originals!\nThere’s 2 cases that needs some special attention from the judge, Pete’s is one of them. He’s going last when there’s nobody else left in the room besides me, the 2 other dudes that get inside the ‘’private room’’ with Pete earlier and a girl!?! Oh wait, there’s also a peace officer that appeared as soon as Pete went to front of the room to speak with the judge. This peace officer at first stayed in the back of the room, observed everyone in the room and took notes then he move a little foward to sit down. I stayed in the back; i’m the officer’s dead angle. During all the meeting, this officer paid a special attention to the 2 dudes that were with Pete sitting in the front of the room. When one of them looked at his phone during the argumentation, he went very suspicious, looking like he was about to jump on him!\nThe argumentation tomorrow.... there's some crazy stuf in there, i really liked when the lawyer refers to the SURETY of the PERSON as it was the SECURITY OF HIS RIGHTS(!?!?!)  ...but i need to sleep now!!

Le présent Code vise à assurer une meilleure protection des citoyens et citoyennes en développant au sein des services policiers des normes élevées de services à la population et de conscience professionnelle dans le respect des droits et libertés de la personne dont ceux inscrits dans la Charte des droits et libertés de la personne.»\n\n………. dans le respect des droits et libertés de la personne dont ceux inscrits dans la Charte des droits et libertés de la personne\n\n………. dans le respect des droits et libertés de la personne dont ceux inscrits dans la Charte des droits et libertés de la personne\n\nCe n’est PAS moi qui le dit, mais bien leur code de déontologie, right ?\n\nAnyways, ils ne m’ont pas dévoilé qui était pour être la partie détenant la SÛRETÉ, ils m’ont tout simplement arrêté et mis les menottes pour ENTRAVE :D\n\nC’est eux qui REFUSENT de respecter la Charte et c’est MOI qui ENTRAVE :D\n\nEn tout cas, ils ont écrit 3 tickets, et j’ai décidé que je ne rachèterais pas ces dettes. J’ai décidé que j’étais pour utiliser la SÛRETÉ de MA personne, pour que cette SÛRETÉ puisse DÉCHARGER ces dettes/tickets adressées à MA personne. Ca tombe bien je sais comment transformer leurs bordereaux de paiement et LETTRES DE CHANGE.\n\nSi vous ne savez pas ce qu’est une LETTRE DE CHANGE, c’est tout simplement du CA$H :D\n\nC’est écrit dans la LOI sur la Gestion des Finances PUBLIQUES qu’une LETTRE DE CHANGE c’est de l’argent……allez voir, Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques (L.R.C. (1985), ch. F-11)\nC’est écrit dans la première page, ou sont les DÉFINITIONS…..\n\nfonds Sommes d’argent; y sont assimilés les effets de commerce. (money)\nDonc, de l’argent c’est des effets de commerce, donc, il faut aller voir la définition de « effet de commerce », right?\n\neffet de commerce Titre négociable, notamment chèque, chèque de voyage, traite, lettre de change ou titre de versement postal. (negotiable instrument)\n\nVOYEZ-VOUS !!!........Une LETTRE DE CHANGE est un EFFET DE COMMERCE, et un EFFET DE COMMERCE est de L’ARGENT……ce n’est toujours bin pas de ma faute, right ? :/\n\nBon, anyways, pour pas faire quoi que ce soit d’illégal, ou d’immoral, ou d’illicite, ou d’illégitime :D\n\nJe leurs ai envoyé 2 lettres de change, taqué après ces 2 lettres de change j’ai mis un AVIS, les AVISANT de ce que je faisais, pourquoi je le faisais et comment je le faisais, et je leur ai dit……SI VOUS REFUSEZ, JUSTE ME RETOURNER CES LETTRES DE CHANGE ET JE VAIS PAYER….fuck, c’est pas compliqué ça, non? :/ ….bien entendu, ils ont reçu le tout par courrier enregistré.\n\nLa ville de Terrebonne n’a rien fait, absolument rien……..ils ont continué leurs procéssus de collection comme ils le font d’habitude, donc, j’ai continué à RÉCLAMER ces lettres de change si ils refusaient ce règlement, et PROMIS DE PAYER aussitôt que je les reçois…..mais non, pas un son de leurs part :/\n\nIls ont mandaté un huissier, j’ai fais EXACTEMENT la même chose avec ce Huissier, j’ai PROMIS DE PAYER si on me remettait ces lettres de change que la ville de Terrebonne semblait refuser.\n\nPourtant la LOI est claire, l’article 337 du code criminel est TRÈS claire….\n\nCes lettres de change sont des BIENS (De l’Argent), et elles m’appartiennent si elles sont REFUSÉES.\n\nEmployé public qui refuse de remettre des biens\n337 Est coupable d’un acte criminel et passible d’un emprisonnement maximal de quatorze ans quiconque, étant ou ayant été employé au service de Sa Majesté du chef du Canada ou d’une province, ou au service d’une municipalité, et chargé, en vertu de cet emploi, de la réception, de la garde, de la gestion ou du contrôle d’une chose, refuse ou omet de remettre cette chose à une personne qui est autorisée à la réclamer et qui, effectivement, la réclame.\n• S.R., ch. C-34, art. 297.\nEt L’Article 340 aussi est claire…\n\nDestruction de titres\n340 Est coupable d’un acte criminel et passible d’un emprisonnement maximal de dix ans quiconque, à des fins frauduleuses, détruit, efface, cache ou oblitère :\n• a) soit un titre de marchandises ou de bien-fonds;\n• b) soit une valeur ou un acte testamentaire;\n• c) soit un document judiciaire ou officiel.\n• S.R., ch. C-34, art. 300.\nCes lettres de change sont des VALEURS, de l’argent….\n\nEt aussi l’article 341….\n\nFait de cacher frauduleusement\n341 Est coupable d’un acte criminel et passible d’un emprisonnement maximal de deux ans quiconque, à des fins frauduleuses, prend, obtient, enlève ou cache quoi que ce soit.\n• S.R., ch. C-34, art. 301.\n\nPOURQUOI CACHER CES LETTRES DE CHANGE SI ELLES SONT REFUSÉES ???? \n\nDonc, le Huissier m’a dit que la ville de Terrebonne ne pouvait pas me retourner ces lettres de change parce que cela les engagerait LÉGALEMENT dans quelque chose (J’ai enregistré ca) ….le Huissier m’a téléphoné à trois reprises, et j’ai enregistré ces trois conversation, c’est tout à fait FASCINANT… :-o\n\nDonc, j’ai AVISÉ ce huissier qu’il n’avait pas mon CONSENTEMENT exprès ou tacite pour pénétrer dans MA demeure, et ce tant et aussi longtemps que la Ville de Terrebonne GARDERAIT et/ou CACHERAIT ces lettres de change.\n\nArticle 7 et 8 de la Charte Québécoise….\n\n7. La demeure est inviolable.\n1975, c. 6, a. 7.\n \n8. Nul ne peut pénétrer chez autrui ni y prendre quoi que ce soit sans son consentement exprès ou tacite.\n1975, c. 6, a. 8.\nJe l’ai AVISÉ combien j’étais pour RÉCLAMER si il me violait mes DROITS fondamentaux….\n\nJ’AI TOUJOURS ÉTÉ OUVERT COMME UN LIVRE AVEC EUX…..ils savaient TOUS ce qui était pour se produire si ils me violaient mes DROITS FONDAMENTAUX….\n\nET J’AI TENU MES PROMESSES……\n\nLe huissier a finalement pénétré dans ma demeure sans mon consentement exprès ou tacite le 8 octobre 2015, et ce, pendant mon absence :D\n\nDonc, j’ai agis tout de suite, tel que promis 2 mois auparavant, j’ai enregistré un privilège légal sur cette firme pour $2 millions en tant que SÉCURITÉ POUR COÛT.\n\nEt J’ai envoyé un AVIS DE RÉCLAMATION, sans réponse de leurs part\n\nJ’ai envoyé une FACTURE de $10 millions pour violations de 5 droits fondamentaux, ces prix ont été AVISÉ d’avance…..ils savait EXACTEMENT tout…\n\nJ’ai envoyé un AVIS pour non-paiement de facture\n\nJ’ai envoyé un AVIS FINAL\n\nJ’ai envoyé un AVIS DE DÉFAUT\n\nEt finalement, j’ai enregistré un PRIVILÈGE LÉGALE, sur chacun de ces AVIS, je leurs ai dit que si je n’avais pas le DROIT de faire ça, de juste me le confirmer par écrit et que j’annulerais le TOUT.\n\nComme ceci….\n\n« Si je n’ai pas le droit de réclamer, et vous croyez que cette réclamation est frivole ou farfelu, juste m’en aviser par écrit et je vais l’annuler, et comprendre que je suis votre esclave, et que je n’ai aucun droits, et je vais agir en conséquence, JE VOUS LE PROMETS. »\n\nJ’ai fais EXACTEMENT la même chose avec la Ville de Terrebonne….\n\nEt suite à l’enregistrement de ces privilège, ils ont capoté :D\n\nIls m’ont amené en cour, pour essayer de faire RADIER ces privilèges et me faire croire que c’est ILLÉGALE de faire ça….non, sérieusement, ils me disent que c’est ILLÉGAL de faire ça et me demande de leurs PROMETTE de ne plus le faire :D\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!......je vais faire des capsule vidéo pour vous expliquer ce qui s’est passé en cour à date……vous allez tomber sur le cul :D\n\nEn passant, j’ai fais EXACTEMENT la même chose en cour, j’ai PROMIS DE PAYER SI LA VILLE DE TERREBONNE ME REMETTAIT CES LETTRES DE CHANGE QU’ELLE SEMBLE VOULOIR REFUSER :D\n\nLe Juge André Prévost a ORDONNÉ a la Ville de Terrebonne de revenir a la cour avec ces lettres de change ORIGINALES la semaine suivante. Il a spécifié que c’est LUI qui était pour être au tribunal, et que nous allons pouvoir RÉGLER le tout la semaine suivante….\n\nC’était d’une simplicité atroce, j’ai PROMIS a la cour que j’étais pour SIGNER/CONSENTIR a TOUT ce qu’ils veulent aussitôt que J’ai ces 2 lettres de change ORIGINALE dans mes mains….J’ai l’audio de cette audience, c’est FASCINANT :-o\n\nEt la semaine suivante, devinez QUOI !!!! …..JE ME SUIS FAIT FOURRÉ, le juge n’était pas là. C’était un autre juge, et je me suis débattu pendant plus d’une heure……et me SUIS FAIT FOURRÉ d’aplomb. D’ailleurs, je l’ai VERBALISÉ….J’ai dis en pleine cour….\n\nJE SUIS EN TRAIN DE ME FAIRE FOURRER ICITTE……et personne ne s’y est objecté, pas d’outrage au tribunal, rien…..\n\nJ’ai toutes les bonnes raisons de croire que la Ville de Terrebonne commet une FRAUDE en gardant ces lettres de change, car c’est écrit dans la Loi sur les Lettres de change, et dans le code criminel. J’ai toutes les bonnes raisons de croire que leurs Avocats participe à cette FRAUDE, et j’ai toutes les bonnes raisons de croire que la JUSTICE assiste ces fraudeurs pour mieux me violer mes DROITS.\n\nApparament, selon le juge Pierre LABELLE, mes lettres de change ne sont pas des lettres de change, et la BANQUE du Canada n’est PAS une BANQUE :D , on m’annonce ça le 17 juin 2016, je leur dit, OH, OK, OU SONT ELLES ? …..et personne ne le sais :D\n\nJe suis complètement fasciné par ces affirmations :D\n\nCeci est un court résumé :/\n\nJe vais poster sous peu l’audio de la première audience (10 Juin 2016) avec le juge André Prévost, qui faisait preuve de COMPÉTENCE et D’IMPARTIALITÉ…….d’ailleurs, je l’ai remercié pour ça dès le lendemain, peut-être que j’aurais dû attendre :/ ….je ne sais pas POURQUOI le 17 juin 2016 le juge André Prévost était ABSENT, peut-être qu’en le remerciant pour sa compétence et son impartialité il ne pouvait plus agir autrement? …\n\nPOUQUOI toute cette HOSTILITÉ envers MOI, qui veut simplement faire accepter, reconnaitre et VALOIR me droits FONDAMENTAUX, pourtant DÉCRÉTÉS par Sa Majesté, et ce, de l’avis et du CONSENTEMENT de l’Assemblée Nationale du Québec ? ….c’est tout ce que je fais !! ….vraiment là!!! :(\n\nPOURQUOI ne pas simplement ANNULER cette charte? :/ ...et nous avouer que nous sommes TOUS des esclaves de ces dettes publiques, et qu'on doit fermer nos gueules et PAYER? \n\nÀ SUIVRE…..
