For the purposes of this article, there are no purported \"gurus\" in this forum, Christians believe they have an invisible companion, and money is a TENDER FOR LAW.  On a personal note, theists could, I suppose, park their imaginary friends at the door, but as the saying goes, \"If you believe that, you'll buy these shoes\".  That level of credulity, which by its very nature permeates every aspect of your existence, simply does not coexist well with critical thought.\n\nAlthough all of these things are connected, only one of these things interests me today - money as LEGAL TENDER.  I'm really confused as to why this concept seems so difficult to the average person.  Our lives revolve around the concept of tenders.  \n\nBasically, a tender is an offer that can be accepted or rejected.\n\nFrom childhood, we put out tenders for affection, acceptance, or stuff, to our parents and strangers, by being cute, or funny, or disingenous.  If the \"cuteness\" is accepted we may get affection, candy or a new bike.  In this system we are subject to the whims of these adults, their oversight and their rules.\n\nIn adulthood we continue to put out tenders for affection, financial or material gain, and even copulation.  Here too we have made the transition to bigger acceptance and better toys, and are now subject to larger oversight and different rules.\n\nIf someone \"offers\" you a flower on the street, you'd better believe it's a tender for pointless conversation or a \"charitable donation\".\n\nIf you're a woman sitting alone in a bar and someone sidles up to you and offers to buy you a drink, what you're really dealing with is a TENDER for SEX.  In this country at least, there are penalties for simply forcing yourself on another person.  You can, however, raise a tender with dinner, a drink, a fur coat, or a trip to Disneyland; and few people are ultimately confused at the expected outcome.\n\nWhy then should the concept of LEGAL TENDER be so obtuse?  Money is something you don't own, and didn't make.  In fact you can't make it - it's a closed system.  You can possess it or use it (see debt in transit), but only if you observe the terms and conditions set by others (not you again) for its use.  The fact that everyone uses and values it, doesn't make availing yourself of this luxury any less a tender.  If you \"owned\" the money you could set your own terms and conditions for its use.  As you don't, the terms and conditions are set by other controlling entities.  By using others' property you agree to be bound by certain rights and obligations - why else would you be participating in this system?  The use of institutionalized money benefits you when you colour inside the lines, and makes you accountable for non-performance when you don't.  There is, in fact, a fairly mature and far-reaching web of systems all working in concert to reward or punish depending on the profit you generate, and how well, or poorly, you perform.\n\nLet's look at a practical example.  If I have a car, and I let you use it, I might tell you that it must be returned in pristine condition, or with a full tank of gas.  Those are just some of the terms I might set.  I might tell you to pick up my aunt Flora at the doctor's office as well.  If you agree to the stipulations I have set, you can accept the loan of the car.  Let's say you forget to collect aunt Flora, and return the car on empty with garbage in the back seat.  I might be angry, I might want you to pay for cleaning the car, or I might send burly men to beat you up.  The only sure thing is that it's probably the last time I'll loan you the car.\n\nUsing conventional money has benefits, no doubt about it.  It's more convenient than working directly for food or shelter, and more socially acceptable than bringing a chicken or pig to exchange for a new outfit.

I have a lot to say about him, I was in Sweden when he actually asked to call me all the way from his expensive little penthouse in Toronto to sniff me out, let me digress and say that I guess because I am trustworthy, people tend to confide spontaneously, I don t ask questions, I find it rude....anyways, before this Scott flipped out on me 2 days later, the first phone call he called overseas at his own expense, we must have talked 40 mn, then he asked me to get skype ( I did and uninstalled it after the blow out and incidentally it had scrambled the PC I was in so bad I had to let a friend remote fix from the US, and even for her using logmein, and her expertise as an ex US force repair tech for PC circuitry outer space in orbit for their special satellites....she is retired, in the process she just about got her PC all fucked up too, the creep must have done soemthing, he is a PC programmer or something in those lines, besides his legal shit. Anyways, what I found out about him, is for one he is hiding behind a shady trust calles aquilae trust, in it was then Dean Clifford and Andrew Langevin, I saw andrew enter the penthouse on day two, on skype....the other thing is he told me they had 10K in the trust to take down Robert Menard....then that his goal is to re-instate the trust of the Monarchy, when I asked which Monarchy, he said Elizabeth, and went on on how of a hottie she used to be and how she upholds the Common Law, ok well technically I guess, but then he got on my case, giving me shit for all the notices I sent, I sent only 2, one to the receiver general saying I was voiding all my contracts, sin, citizenship and all, and why....( that part for a later conversation, or go to my about page and you will eventually find it ) the other was a 10 day notice, about me giving allegience to God, I dropped that one on the shores of the NSA, on a public board they admiister. Well Scott started flipping on me about God, and how tired he is of all these people with uimaginary friends etc, and when I started taking his argument down, he outright started calling me a cunt and screaming I just said goodbye and hang up on him. I knew them I was onto something, who the hell would call Sweden for 40 mn other than a high level rat. So I blocked him on FB, I blocked Andrew and Dean as well, Mika has kept Andrew on his list. I have warned Robert about this, now I am telling you, and I agree with you they are terrified of God, but I do have genuine atheist friends who threw the baby with the bath water, because of their hate for the hateful things religions have and are doing in the name of God, and I can t blame them, if they only knew they just threw the emergency exist key away, but hey there is not much I can do about it, most of them couldn t be bothered finding out their rights anyways, and I am tired of wasting my saliva, but yeah Mika is interesting, but when I look at his face type when his hair is short, he looks awfully like the special marching platoon of the rc's on Canada day and remembreance day....they all looked like clones when I saw them march in Duncan BC once, I couldn t beleive they had found so many men with the same skull structure, the lions with wide cheeckbones big heads, all sporting the mean look of vengence, strange parade that was. For the longest I used to admire Mika for at least speaking his mind, one day via Andrew the Greek fellow from Montreal who was in phone contact with me in 2012 and had Mika at his cousin s place for a bit, a visit that didn t end well, anyways I got to hear Mika's voice on the phone, and it wasn t anything I expected, it didn t fit the image, I could feel a lot of vanity in it, or something I can t really put a finger on, but although a nice voice, selfishness ? not sure wat it was, but love wasn t what I felt, we'll watch and see, good meeting you and John Spirit.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"536480436387893","comment_count":0,"created_time":1373756265000,"message":"Oh yes, Pierre!

You still get Nazis, so there's that.\n\nJust because they don't feel like following the rules, doesn't mean we have to be ‚Äúscumbags‚Äù like them.  I listened to all the audio recordings that Dean Kory made of his hearings (time I'll never get back, so you fucking owe me, dude!), and I feel it's important for me to correct a few key points here.\n\nI know all of you get your information from multiple sources, ranging from the Grand-Poobah of the Free-Dumb Movement, Robert Menard, to Dean Clifford, to Winston Strout; and maybe it's just self-aggrandizement, but I like to think I'm the only source that tells you the truth instead of just orbiting it.  As with many things in life there's ‚Äúmore than one way to skin a cat‚Äù.  However, one of the worst things you can do is ‚Äúmix methods‚Äù.\n\nDean Clifford and I are at exact opposite ends of the scale.  Dean's name is Trust property, thus giving the man that you know as Dean Clifford a great number of options the rest of you don't have.  He doesn't use the Trust like a bank machine, he doesn't abuse any of the authority that any Trust title gives him, and he has the personal knowledge that he's not on his own if he has to ‚Äúget the fuck out of Dodge‚Äù.  That's where the consensus ends amoung us.  \n\nDean's teachings on Trust Law are accurate, concise and accessible.  For some reason it's worth it for him to give everything he teaches those qualities.  \n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI'm not a super-genius, and I don't possess any mental powers that you don't.  Any discussion and/or engagement with me starts off with the reality that you ALL THINK WRONG, and YOU ALL VALUE THE WRONG THINGS!  This does not serve you when you are up against reality.\n\nThe sad part is that most of you are too old to change; and as I've demonstrated here in this little forum,   none of you can tell the difference between what's true and what feels good.  I know what you're experiencing.  Whether from Dean, or from myself, the time always comes when you read something that one of us writes and you KNOW that it is true; but you take no further time to understand what is being told to you.\n\nFortunately Dean Kory has provided us a working/living example of what happens when all of the above factors are in play.\n\nThe first obvious mistake that Dean Kory is making is that he is combining what Dean Clifford teaches with what I teach.  For the purposes of this article I'm going to dumb the two positions down so you can make the comparison.\n\nDean Clifford is all about being left alone, and when he's not left alone, he is about calling ‚Äúthem‚Äù to account.  \n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI am descended from the very people that put all of this in place.  Entire stereotypes about Scottish people exist to misdirect.  Most will tell you that Scotsmen are ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, when in reality we are conservative about when we engage in commerce.  You have but to look at England's and Scotland's history to see why this is true.  \n\nThe very name of this group, THE TENDER FOR LAW, is all about that mysterious phrase, ‚ÄúTHIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER‚Äù.  \n\nI'll be the first to admit there are a great number of benefits to be enjoyed in commerce, when everybody plays by the rules.  As I'm sure everyone is sadly aware of, by now; Nobody is playing by the rules anymore. \n\nTrying to ‚Äúfix the system‚Äù, or call them to account in their own system, is simply ‚Äúappealing to your rapist‚Äù.  It baffles me that anyone would think this is sound thinking.\n\n...I digress.\n\nAs I'm in a unique position to ‚Äúfollow the money‚Äù, I can determine who needs to pay the price for the royal screw-over we've been given.  As I type this, a team of system's engineers (and trained monkeys) are preparing for you, the reader, a step-by-step guide for cleaning out every financial institution that touches these shores.  The only price that I ask for this knowledge is that you pass it on to others.  Pay it forward...and get paid at the same time.  Who else offers that shit?\n\nI am many things.  I am prorogued Nobility.  I am a published author.  I am a composer.  Above all...the thing that forms the core of who and what I am, is that I am a computer scientist.  Those who have taken the time to actually listen to me, will recognize many ‚ÄúScott-isms‚Äù; and the phrase ‚ÄúCOMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING‚Äù is repeated almost as often as my Number 1 ‚ÄúScott-ism‚Äù, ‚ÄúTHE MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG.‚Äù  You ignore these two truths at your own peril. \n\n...and reality does not care what you ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù.\n\nThis lengthy preamble is to drive the next point home.  \n\nDO NOT TRY TO COMBINE DEAN'S METHODS WITH MINE.\n\nThere is no remedy in fraud.  There simply isn't.\n\nIn many ways I long for the old days where those who breached the PUBLIC TRUST were hauled into the street and thrown into an angry mob.  Authors have mistakenly used the term, ‚ÄúHanging Judge‚Äù  as a term for a judge imposing strict penalties; but if you look through actual history, and not the crap you were taught in the Public Fool System, ‚ÄúHanging Judge‚Äù refers to a judge who has abused his power and has been hung for the abuse of that trust. He gives sentences he should be hung for; HANGING JUDGE. You never hear the phrase ‚Äúhanging JUSTICE‚Äù ;) This is odd, as there are so many of them. :D  ...I know. Digressing. I get it.\n\nWe don't have Judges any more, in Canada.  A judge traditionally was a trusted individual who could uphold the PUBLIC TRUST.  ‚ÄúWe the people‚Äù no longer get to decide who is worthy of that trust.  People confuse the role of ‚Äújudge‚Äù with the current role of ‚ÄúJUSTICE‚Äù.  It is important to know the distinction.\n\nJUSTICE is actually a ‚Äúdoing-business-as‚Äù name for a Crown Corporation.  It actually says, in the Dunn and Bradstreet listings ‚ÄúGovernment of Ontario Operating as JUSTICE‚Äù.  It has been like that, IN VARIOUS FORMS, since 1982.\n.\n..I'm sorry you missed it.\n\nThat is what you're dealing with, and you have ONE unalienable RIGHT; THE RIGHT NOT TO CONTRACT.  \n\nMy position is a lot closer to that held by Irene Gravenhorst, than it is to Dean Clifford's.\n\nSo, let's cover what Dean Kory is doing wrong! :D\n\nI notice a lot of ‚ÄúClifford-isms‚Äù in what Dean Kory is clearly attempting to say; but all of Dean Clifford's methods depend on what I like to refer to as ‚ÄúClubhouse Rules‚Äù, and every time you do this you're pretending to ‚Äúbe in the club‚Äù.  The natural response to somebody doing this is very similar to the response to somebody saying they know more than I.  In case you haven't noticed I smack them down in the most humiliatingly, and public way possible.  ‚ÄúTheir‚Äù reaction is going to be much the same...we're all human after all.\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE (like the cheese) stands alone.\n\nIt is the only issue you should be concerned about! NOTHING ELSE!\n\nSERIOUSLY! Accepting discussion about anything else, is a FUCKING NEGOTIATION.  All of you are not seeing the forest through the trees.  This is why I say Dean Clifford's position is flawed.  He believes the tree can be pruned to look pretty again, when in reality it needs it's roots burned out, and it's limbs chopped up for one of Sir-Mica's gassifiers! The fucking tree is dead!\n\nUNDERSTAND?\n\nThe tree is dead!  \n\nIt's filled with parasites and rot, and the parasites are trying to keep the illusion of a tree standing.  For the past two years I have been feeding them the rope, at my own expense, and with violence inflicted upon me, so that any argument contrary to my position is immediately nullified.  IT IS/WILL BE, CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE that you are NOT getting what you are entitled to, given the burden of surety you have carried!\n\nUnlike THE MAJORITY of your ‚Äúsources of truth‚Äù:\n\nI'm not one of these people that wants to drive without a licence.  \nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their mortgage.  \nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their taxes.  \nI DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE I FUCKING PROMISED TO!\nI am, however, someone that possesses knowledge and skills that the government finds/found essential to their expansion.  In my youth I gave our erstwhile government a tool, which all of you pay the price for today; and I was rewarded handsomely.  I patted myself on the back, and strutted around, knowing that I was smarter than everyone else, and never once paying attention to the harm I had caused.\n\nIn compliance with an oath I took a long time ago, I must atone for that; and that's the only reason you, the reader, even know that I exist.  \n\nI need to remind you again, that the only reason I'm here, is that I promised to be.\n\nNone of you have value to me.  You're not qualified to.\n\nI have a lot to teach you, and we are barely getting started; but I am not responsible for the shit that goes wrong when you try to take what I teach you (‚ÄúREALITY‚Äù) and you try to jam it into your idiotic, unqualified, belief structure.  As I write that sentence I wonder how many of you have actually pondered that other ‚ÄúScott-ism‚Äù you frequently hear; ‚ÄúALL BELIEF IS EVIL.‚Äù  If you believe something, you will stop questioning it; you will stop investigating it, and you will never ponder if, and why, it's true.\n\nShould you believe something, that just happens to be true, you won't look any further ‚Äì and that's a problem.  \n\nSo I want everyone to keep the following in mind.  All the sources you are investigating tell the truth about the law, but there are pitfalls!\n\nEverything Robert Menard says about the law is true.  It's what he doesn't say that's the lie.  If you want quick confirmation of this simply ask him what, ‚ÄúThis note is legal tender‚Äù means.  If he tells you the truth (he won't), ask him why he's constantly ‚Äúbegging‚Äù for that very same TENDER FOR LAW that contains the ACTS and STATUTES that he claims don't apply to him! THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER is a TENDER FOR LAW. If you BENEFIT, then you have OBLIGATION!\n  \nEverything Dean Clifford says about the law is true, but how he chooses to apply it, is not; because there's still a lot of ‚Äúbelief‚Äù running around in his head.  He still believes he can ‚Äúbeat them at their own game.‚Äù  He will proudly point out their public and blatant violations... His evidence is irrefutable and conclusive. His rights are violated by those TRUSTEES of the PUBLIC, and then he tries to seek remedy from those same trustees! REALLY? \n\n...and then says the remedy, is to go to those very same people and ‚Äúsue‚Äù them..in the very same courts that violated his rights. (What?)  ...Oh that's right, those are DIFFERENT courts, with DIFFERENT\n ‚ÄúDoing business as‚Äù JUSTICES. (WHAT?)  ...well, I'll just let you work out the flaw from there. If you can't, then you are too stupid to be reading this, and you should kill yourself.\n\nFeel free to try it this way. It's NOT ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, but it ignores the fact that those who hold the PUBLIC TRUST, ARE wrong. Another ‚ÄúScott-ism‚Äù is my position that NONE OF YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT FEELS GOOD! Following Dean Clifford's methods WILL drive this point home, so it's not a COMPLETE waste. ;)\n\nWell then...back to Dean Kory.\n\nRumour has it, through the grape vine, that the erstwhile Mr. Kory has been and/or will be, a guest on Global C.R.A.P. Radio, hosted by the redoubtable Tony ‚Äúguy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth‚Äù Butros.  This promises to be an exciting show, and I cannot wait to miss it.  I eagerly anticipate the thrill of not consuming time I'll never get back.  \n\nInstead I'll put something useful here ‚Äì advice for your next court room appearance, Mr. Kory.\n\nWhen you're in the court room dealing with these babbling, sacks-of-shit, learn to use the breaks.  Repeat after me, ‚ÄúI DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS‚Äù.  If they ignore your question, then your next response should be, ‚ÄúOBJECTION.  If the court cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.‚Äù  Keep repeating that, and repeating that, and repeating that...until they answer your fucking question.  \n\nI listen to you in court, Dean Kory, and I picture a girl screaming rape while slipping the condom on the rapist.  I notice the distinct lack of that phrase in ANY of your recordings, so repeat it in your head, ‚ÄúObjection.  If you cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.‚Äù\n\nApply THE TENDER FOR LAW Rule to this.  I choose my words very, very carefully, because I know what they mean.  You, the reader, seem to believe there's a library in your ass, because that's demonstrably where you keep pulling your answer out of.  If you see me using a phrase that should be used in court, the very first thing you should do is follow my rules.  Look up every single word, even, no scratch that, ESPECIALLY, if you THINK you know what the word means.  As the regular reader for THE TENDER FOR LAW will tell you, you most certainly don't.\n\nDean Kory reserves his rights, and then doesn't know what the fuck to do with them; but that's ok, because there are plenty of other people in the court room that know what to do with Dean Kory's rights.  \n\nOne thing Dean Kory should learn is that he is most certainly not Dean Clifford.  Make no mistake, it doesn't matter if I disagree with Dean Clifford's methods.  The fact is, I understand them.  What Dean Clifford is doing is beyond your current level of comprehension.  He is not joking when he says that everything he says and does, is part of a larger plan.  I disagree with Dean Clifford's position and methods, because he pays too high a price for the sake of worthless people; but he's doing it for all of you, and not just for himself.  I will admit statistically, this does skew the numbers in his favour; because in the end, Dean Clifford is like you.  You all think wrong, and value the wrong things.\n\nThe only difference between you and Dean Clifford is that some of the things he values ARE the right things.  \n\nWe are all doing this for different reasons.  \n\nRobert Menard will try to scam you out of every cent you have by telling you the truth...because he thinks you deserve it.  You're the Mafia wife, the enabler, and he rationalizes that he's not taking anything of any value from you.  \n\nDean Clifford sees that you're all asleep, and he values mankind as a whole; but like Mary Croft before him, he's beginning to realize that everyone prefers ‚Äúlucid dreaming‚Äù to actually being awake.  The time he takes pandering to that crowd robs him of time, and returns nothing.  \n\nMy position is blatantly self-centered.  I was born with a title I didn't choose.  I was sold to the government, and warehoused for McMaster University because it turned out I was smarter than everybody...and apparently that's a crime.  When I began to call all parties to account, they spared themselves by making certain promises and offering certain concessions and entitlements, which they no longer honour.  \n\nMy aim is to misbehave.\n\nLike Robert Menard, I want you to suffer for your ignorance, especially if you've come to me before.  I want to wield what I know against those who would dare seek to harm me and those that I care about; because all of you are walking a path now, and none of you realize it's a one-way trip.  You all want your freedom, and my position is, ‚ÄúBe careful what you wish for.‚Äù  \n\nAs you all think wrong, and value the wrong things, so it is unlikely you could possibly know what to do with freedom.  If you find yourself making that one-way trip, through that hole in the fence, remember that on the other side, are people just like me.\n\nAll of you are welcomed to believe whatever makes you feel good.  Martin Sutton's belief, for instance, makes him feel good, and he identifies it as the core of who he is; and all I can think is, ‚ÄúThis is what happens when evil has consumed an extraordinary man.‚Äù\n\nALL belief is evil.  Martin Sutton is incapable of evil, so the belief sits there like a parasite, taking this man's good qualities and giving them to ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù.  \n\nAt this point I can classify Martin Sutton as belief's ‚Äúbest-case-scenario‚Äù.  \n\nBelief is taking not thinking and making a virtue out of it.  \n\nAll of the people from whom you seek knowledge are extraordinary in their own way.  However, reality doesn't care about these things.  \n\nI certainly hope this effort gets Mr. Kory focused on what's important, but the reality is, all of this is a symptom of a much larger problem.\n\nWe're all running out of time.  I don't know if anyone has noticed the professional name-callers have been labeling people who point out the truth as ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù, while at the same time publishing the inane babbling of actual conspiracy theorists.  This method is much like Americans putting people who hire hookers on sex-offender registries, thus removing any distinction between a guy who indulges in a rent-a-fuck-toy experience, and the Scarborough rapist.  Because none of you understand the exponential function, you couldn't see the bell-curve of your rights being whittled away.\n\nBefore I end this article, let's take a little walk through Canadian legal history.\n\nAt this point in legal history, the Criminal Code pretends to be the Common Law remedy, bestowed to an administrative zone of a sole proprietor CORPORATION called Canada...but this wasn't always the case.\n\nI'm going to presume that you don't have knowledge of the Canadian Bill of Rights.  I freely admit this is not a reasonable presumption as Dean Clifford never shuts up about it (I swear that guy jerks off reading it).  \n\nOne of the most protected rights in that bill of rights was Freedom of Speech.  Under the Bill of Rights ‚Äúoffences‚Äù like hate speech, blasphemous libel (yes, that's a criminal code offence ‚Äì look it up), and ‚Äúuttering a death threat‚Äù, would not be possible.  \n\nThe UK Canada Act 1982, better known as ‚ÄúThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms‚Äù,  includes a ‚Äúnotwithstanding‚Äù clause.  This gives the elected representatives of an administrative zone's constituency the power and authority to say, ‚ÄúFuck off, that's just stupid,‚Äù to any Federal Statute.  The closest a province has ever come to using this was on the ‚Äúgay marriage‚Äù issue.  Everyone's entire government had just been privatized, and their biggest concern appeared to be whether two dudes can marry.  \n\nI look at events like this and sometimes I can't help but think, ‚ÄúMaybe Menard's right.  Maybe you do deserve it.‚Äù  \n\nAnyway, while you were all in a tizzy about whether a dude can wear a wedding dress and be taken seriously, other more sinister machinations were afoot.  \n\nHis name is Ernst Z√ºndel of Regina v. Z√ºndel fame, and his story went something like this:\n\nErnst Z√ºndel is one of those ideological pustules on society that invariably erupt when free speech is so vigorously protected.  I've read what Mr. Z√ºndel has to say, and he cites reliable sources to support his position.  This ignores the reality, and other evidence, that counters his position.  \n\nWhat's more reasonable to accept?\n\nThat the holocaust didn't happen?  Or that Roma (gypsies), the mentally ill, the handicapped, the Muslims, the Jews, the homosexuals, and the political dissidents, were all rounded up and exterminated; and the Jews just whined about it the most.  People doing stupid things at ‚Äúcrime scenes‚Äù don't help, and support idiots like Mr. Z√ºndel.  With only a little, tiny bit of probing, you will discover this fun fact regarding the holocaust.  Those smoke-stacks on Auschwitz  were built in 1947 for ‚Äúdramatic effect‚Äù; and when pressured on it, every holocaust memorial foundation grudgingly admits this is true.\n\nBut back to Mr. Z√ºndel....\n\nErnst Z√ºndel was doing the Streisand effect, before Barbara Streisand made it cool. \n\nAfter the constitution was ratified, parliament quickly set about whittling away your free speech rights, and Ernst Z√ºndel happened to be in the right place at the right time.  No one knew it then.\n\nNow Ernst Z√ºndel is a hateful little man; and he wants the world to know it.  So much so, he decided you could avail yourself of his opinion by calling up his ‚Äú976 Hate Speech Hotline‚Äù...for the low, low charge of ten dollars appearing on your phone bill, you could injest all the hate-mongering that would fit on an answering machine tape (Yes, a fucking tape.  That's how long ago this shit happened).  \n\nPeople called up and he actually profited from being a hateful little man...and if the story ended there, you could reasonably think, ‚ÄúFuck this is Canada.  You can do anything‚Äù, and we'd all live happily ever after.  \n\nAfter a couple of months of profiting from people with more money than brains, rumour of this great scam eventually fell on the ears of a Jew.  See?  Mel Gibson was right.  Jews are always causing trouble.  Well it came to pass, that this great scam did fall on the ear of a Jew, and attached to that ear of a Jew, was a Jew with a finger, which could dial a telephone; and for the bargain price of ten bucks...he could make history!\n\nI freely admit that I wouldn't pass that shit up, so there's no way a Jew's going to.  Remember the stereotypes kids, and be advised that Jews come to Scottish people to learn humility.\n\nDo you guys see how many stereotypes I've managed to jam into here so far?\n\nAs the result of this hilarious chain of events, Mr. Z√ºndel became the dubious winner of the ‚ÄúFirst Man to be Charged with Hate Speech‚Äù prize.  Under this ‚Äúcode‚Äù Mr. Z√ºndel's position was indefensible, but he had an ‚Äúace up his sleeve‚Äù.  He had studied the constitution and believed he had the right to do what he did.   His lawyer, probably another Jew, saw dollar signs rocketing all the way to the Supreme Court, so he grabbed onto the Law Society's tit and sucked as hard as he could.  This case plodded through the courts relentlessly, and ended up at the Supreme Court where they freely admitted that all hate speech laws are, by their very nature, unconstitutional.  However, Nazis are ‚Äúbad‚Äù so they decided to remove that right and blatantly ignore anything the constitution has to say, with an addendum pointing out that each administrative zone (province) has the right to exercise that ‚Äúnotwithstanding‚Äù clause nobody's ever dared use.  \n\nThey'll save it for something important...like dudes getting married to each other.  I say dudes because I refuse to accept the proposition that hot girl-on-girl action is NOT a human right.\n\nThese events marked the beginning of the slippery slope of rights removal all of you are just discovering now.  It has been happening for a very long time.  \n\nMuch has happened since the Z√ºndel case.  The public is slowly spoon-fed ridiculous concepts.  The United States slipped even faster using our ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù hate-speech laws as an example.  Now there is a perfectly ‚Äúlegal‚Äù ‚ÄúWar on Terror‚Äù.  Americans are so stupid that they don't even realise they're making war on something that's not even an noun.  ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù at least meets the ‚Äúnoun‚Äù criterion.  If you had to defend the ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù, it's only defense would be, ‚ÄúAt least we're making war on a noun.‚Äù\n\nI'll let that sink in.\n\nHow many stupid ‚ÄúPatriotic Americans‚Äù don't realize there's a war on something that's not even a fucking noun.  If I think you don't deserve to live for not realizing that, imagine how low you rank in the eyes of those who created this policy ‚Äì all \"perfectly legal\".\n\nWe need a Monarch dictator for a generation, to bitch-slap you back to reality.  For, one of the other things that I don't hide, is the fact that I, and other privateers, commissioned the AQUILAE TRUST with the primary mandate: To assist in the restoration of executive power of the Monarchy, under the terms of the AQUILAE COVENANT.\n\nThree generations ago, Princess Elizabeth called to the then recently-released slaves, to help her stop the Empire from being wiped-out by the Germans.  And she is of German descent.  That war left a legacy that is priceless.  It formed the corner stone of civilization and brought us into a new Golden Age.  \n\nThe laws of commerce work when everybody plays by the rules, and when everybody's rights are respected.  For three decades I have screamed that this is not happening.  \n\nSo I have set out to prove it to you.  My goal is to show you all that there is no deception.  They're just not playing by the rules any more.  The people responsible for your chronic ignorance, jumped ship long ago.  Now we're stuck with parrots and chimps, running a mighty, but decaying, infrastructure.\n\nJust remember this is on an exponential curve too.\n\nI am doing my utmost to construct a lifeboat, and to detach you from all this.  What I am constructing (to paraphrase Q from Star Trek) has wonders to satiate all desires, both subtle and gross.  But it's not for the timid.  \n\nHere is my court room position in a nutshell.  \n\nYou do not accept surety ‚Äì EVER.  \n\nStep 1: Reserve all rights.  (get Derek Moran to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\n\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed.  Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS.  If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. \n\nAnything outside of this supports their position that you are ‚Äúplaying‚Äù their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules.  The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.\n\nThink very carefully about this.  If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\n and its rules, you might raise the obvious question, ‚ÄúWhy do you get to move two pieces?‚Äù  If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game.  You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert.  \n\nNovice drivers and expert drivers all have to follow the same rules.  You don't get to ignore rules because you suck at them.  Just as my chess board is not a chess school, the court will not allow the presumption that you being a novice is a lawful excuse.  The only method to extract yourself ‚Äúwith honour‚Äù is to accept responsibility for the mistake in presumption.  They are presuming something wrong...and you are acknowledging it's your fault.  The court must accept this MISTAKE, and your entreaty for forgiveness for the unintended debt created.  The court MUST do this.  \n\nYour name should never come into it.  Your name is but a piece of evidence in a much larger presumption that the court has the right to attach a name derived from a public document, to a living man.  This, of course, is untrue.  The court knows it's not their right.  That's why in the Mary Croft days, the quote ‚Äúliving man‚Äù argument worked.  But these are trimming at the branches of the poisonous tree in an attempt to make it look pretty.  The only solution is to target the root.  The root is accounting and surety; there's no farther to dig down.\n\nYou have all heard the quote, ‚ÄúI am not a number.  I am a free man.‚Äù  This came from the profoundly subversive British television series, The Prisoner, which exposes the Noble Lie in the most blunt and obvious way possible, without using the actual words.  If you take the time and watch this series, you can see very clearly, knowing what you know so far, exactly how everything is.  The protagonist, played by Patrick McGoohan, who truly supports the concept that acting is an art form, is only ever identified as ‚ÄúNumber 6‚Äù.  The highest ranking officer in the prison is only ‚ÄúNumber 2‚Äù, whose character keeps changing; none of them ever answering the constantly-posed question, ‚ÄúWho is 'Number ONE'?‚Äù  \n\nAnd...because I fucking-love giving away the ending...\n\n‚ÄúNumber ONE‚Äù turns out to be a delusion of the protagonist's own making, whom others around him exploited; all to answer the question, ‚ÄúWhy did you resign?‚Äù  I want you to think about that as you go down this path.  \n\nYou will be pursued by the people you once served, and you will be asked, ‚ÄúWhy did you resign?‚Äù  To answer is to become ‚Äúsalvage‚Äù.  You never learned why ‚ÄúNumber 6‚Äù ‚Äúresigned‚Äù, because his position is what your position should be as regards government.\n\nNONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS!  \n\nIf you want to be even more hostile reach for a ‚ÄúScott-ism‚Äù, FOR WHATEVER REASON OFFENDS YOU THE MOST!\n\nSo there's your homework.  Read this article over, and over, and over again.  Just so there's no confusion, I am communicating on several levels here.  Whoever is reading this, pay close attention to what I say.\n\nThat's it.

(and smiling like an idiot)\n\nGuess who very recently arranged to have an LLC organized in Delaware? ;)\n\nWarning: This is likely one of the longer posts ever submitted/posted here at THE TENDER FOR LAW and will almost certainly be the longest post I will ever make/submit.\n\nMy head is spinning at all the legal possibilities. They seem endless almost. \n\nI have many questions and have to go revisit/find some old threads so I'm not too much of a pain/shit smearer, but I thought I'd post this and a few questions and \"curious\" observations for now.\n\nMy main goal/objective is to create an AFTER document, with the document provide below as the BEFORE document. My hope is that as a group we can together transform this very ordinary and average template (an average boat not much better than a dingy) and using what we have learned here, transform it into a thing of beauty - a magnificent rough ocean worthy \"battleship\" capable of taking on the most formidable opponents and coming out on top.\n\nI'm thinking it might be a good idea to create two kinds of members. Some with more \"rights\" than others (such as voting rights) so as to protect the company from sharks that may get on board. I'd like one of my person to have the power to toss anyone overboard that might endanger the sheep or attempt to steer it in a direction I don't approve of. I want to be the ADMIRAL and make sure I remain the Admiral as long as I want to be. [Yet some of those things seem to conflict with my ethics/or programming (unsure which in some cases)].\n\n******\n\nI humbly suggest it could be FUN FOR EVERYONE and a great way for the newbies to put together the gold nuggets and help them get rid of a bit of the confused look they likely have on their faces all day long.\n\nI know it is a lot of work, but think of all the fun we can have while doing it. :)\n\n******\n\nThe Scoop:\n\nI hired a corporation down there to assist me with the process.\n\nAn AGENT of theirs submitted an application indicating the INTENT to be an ORGANIZER of an LLC in the STATE OF DELAWARE and provided A NAME for the new PERSON to be created. FIAT currency was given to pay FEES. \n\nThe SECRETARY OF STATE then IDENTIFIED the AGENT as the ORGANIZER of the LLC and provided the ORGANIZER a CERTIFICATE OF FORMATION from the SECRETARY OF STATE. It has two numbers, a FILE NUMBER and another number with SR in front of it. (? guessing State Registration) :/\n\nIt appears that the very next thing that the AGENT did was CREATE SOME LAWS. :) They sat at their computer and typed out a few of them (most likely a template) in a document they created and titled INITIAL RESOLUTIONS wherein her PERSON OPERATING AS an ORGANIZER of the LLC indicated her wish to RESOLVE some things. \n\nBUT, before those things could be resolved, as the ORGANIZER with SIGNING AUTHORITY, her PERSON had to state that she wanted to ADOPT a few things - these things called RESOLUTIONS.\n\nSo, then her PERSON resolved to RELINQUISH SIGNING AUTHORITY to the MANAGERS LISTED. Then this ORGANIZER resolved to name names and named me MANAGER of the LLC and signed this LEGAL document that stated that my PERSON will SERVE as MANAGER. (Isn't that nice of PERSON?) BUT, there is a catch, my PERSON will only SERVE as MANAGER until \"the Members(s) vote otherwise.\n\nHere's the other things this organizer RESOLVED in this one page legal document with a whole bunch of LAW in it that the ORGANIZER just made up.\n\n2) The DATE, the STATE, the ASSIGNED filing number.\n3) That the COPY of the ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION is COMPLETE.\n4) That the general PROVISIONS of an OPERATING AGREEMENT be ADOPTED and included as OFFICIAL RECORDS of the LLC. If the MEMBERS choose to adopt a more detailed operating agreement, then it will take precedence \nover general provisions in the ORIGINAL operating agreement.\n5) The MEMBERS have formed (not my person which hired the agent/organizer-not me ACTING as a PERSON/MANAGER of the LLC) the LLC, and (get this) THEY (still not one of MY PERSONS :/) are ENTITLED (ooh that sounds like someone who is privileged) to the FULL EXTENT OF THEIR LIMITED LIABILITY pursuant to State Law. (Somebody who has never lied to me told me that Delaware would be his choice if he were going to start an LLC because it's the best place IN THE WORLD if you enjoy LIMITED LIABILITY and want a lot of it)\n\nAnd talk about LIMITED LIABILITY, #5 goes on to say that even if the MEMBERS (utterly and completely) FAIL to MAINTAIN FORMALITIES of an LLC they are still entitled to all the LL anyways (isn't that nice). \n\nSo I guess that if a MEMBER gets some maple bacon grease on some documents, or loses some, or has to use some important documents to wipe their ass with because they run out of toilet paper, it's not a problem as far as the STATE of Delaware is concerned. \n\nMy person also received a blank template entitled LISTING OF MANAGERS and another template (i'll post a pic of it when I get a chance), namely a LLC MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE. \n\nIt looks like it's printed on that stuff that is often referred to as \"BOND PAPER\" and, to be valid, and, or, complete, it requires signatures in a few places by people with different TITLES. \n\nIt also appears to me that even though this CERTIFICATE looks like a MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE, it's not a MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE until the LLC CAUSES (\"caused this certificate\") \"to be EXECUTED by its MEMBERS\", or it can be BOTH a MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE and a SHARE (until it's cut along a provided dotted line).\n\nHere's where I am a still confused (i am likely being an idiot), as far as I can tell, the LLC doesn't have any members yet. It had an organizer who resolved to name me a MANAGER with signing authority. But no MEMBERS in sight anywhere. \n\nI guess my person had better MANAGE this since it's the manager of this \"MANAGER MANAGED\" LLC. \n\nFor clarification, the top portion of this certificate seems to require the following fields filled out:\n\nLLC NAME, Where it was organized, Total amount of members at X date, What PERSON is (is being) CERTIFIED to be a MEMBER,\nWhat % of INTEREST they HOLD (stating that they are ENTITLED to FULL BENEFITS of such memberSHIP), Date, and two final fields : Named Member and witness AND/OR member\n\n(not sure if it is noteworthy but the title of the final fields is exactly as written - i capped the AND/OR - with a capital N and M while the other field employed a lower case w and lowercase m)\n\nI see that the witness and/or member must sign, and I conclude for now that the Named Member field does not require the new members signature, but should be written in all caps. It could be another LLC person after all.\n\nHere's my first question, and if it's any consolation I feel stupid asking it... What MEMBERS are there that could cause another member to be named? It seems like the chicken and an egg riddle. \n\nAs a Manager, I need to find some \"members\" to EXECUTE this certificate so the LLC can get its very FIRST member. \n\nI'm guessing that since I now have signing authority as the Manager, that I can now create a RESOLUTION resolving to make my PERSON be known, identified, recognized as a MEMBER and/or MEMBERS, print my PERSONS name in the second last field (Named Member) and sign the last field as a \"member\", or get someone else to sign it as a witness. I'm probably complicating things here and need one of those zen ruler swats in the head. :/\n\nEnough of me blabbing...here is my little dingy they sent my person that was just put in the seas of commerce on the shores of Delaware...\n\n***************\n\nLIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OPERATING AGREEMENT\n\nThis Company Agreement of this MANAGER MANAGED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY organized pursuant to applicable state law, is entered into and shall become effective as of the Effective Date by and among the Company and the persons executing this Agreement as Members.

At this point exiting member may not make this intention publicly known. If such other Members decline or fail to elect such interest within sixty (60) days, the exiting member may advertise its membership interest for sale as it sees fit. \n(b) If a member has a buyer of member‚Äôs interest, the other current member(s) have first right of refusal to purchase the exiting members interest for the agreed purchase price. If there are more than one current remaining members, remaining members may combine funds to purchase the exiting members interest. Exiting member must show that potential purchaser has full certified funds, or the ability to get full certified funds before the first right of refusal period starts. Current members have 60 days to buy exiting members interest if they so desire. \n(c) Pursuant to the applicable law, current members may unanimously approve the sale of exiting members‚Äô interests to grant full membership benefits and functionality to the new member. The current remaining members must unanimously approve the sale, or the purchaser or assignee will have no right to participate in the management of the business, affairs of the Company, or member voting rights. The purchaser or assignee shall only be entitled to receive the share of the profits or other compensation by way of income and the return of contributions to which that Member would otherwise be entitled. Exiting member must disclose to buyer or assignee if current members will not approve the sale. \n7.2\nVALUATION OF EXITING MEMBERS INTEREST. If a member wants to exit the LLC, and does not have a buyer of its membership interest, exiting member will assign its interest to current members according to the following set forth procedures:\n(a) A value must be placed upon this membership interest before assigned. \n(b) If exiting member and current members do not agree on the value of this membership interest, exiting member must pay for a certified appraiser to appraise the LLC company value, and the exiting members‚Äô value will be assigned a value according to the exiting members‚Äô interest percentage. \n(c) The current members must approve the certified appraiser used by exiting member. Current members have 30 days to approve the exiting members certified appraiser. If current members disapprove the certified appraiser, they must show evidence to support their disapproval of the certified appraiser as a vendor qualified to make the LLC business appraisal. Current members may not stall the process by disapproving all certified appraisers. \n(d) Upon completion of a certified appraiser placing a value on the LLC, a value will be placed on exiting members‚Äô interest according to exiting members‚Äô percentage of membership interest. \n(e) If current members disagree with the value placed on exiting members‚Äô interest, current members must pay for a certified appraiser to value the LLC and exiting members‚Äô interest according to the same terms. \n(f) Current members‚Äô appraiser must be completed within 60 days or right of current members to dispute the value of exiting members interest expires. \n(g) Upon completion of current members certified appraiser, the exiting member must approve the value placed on exiting members‚Äô interest. Exiting member has 30 days to approve this value. \n(h) If exiting member does not approve current members‚Äô appraiser value, the value of the LLC will be determined by adding both parties‚Äô values, then dividing that value in half, then creating the value of the exiting members‚Äô interest according to the exiting members‚Äô percentage of membership interest. \n7.3\nDISTRIBUTION OF EXITING MEMBERS INTEREST. Upon determination of exiting members‚Äô interest value, the value will be a debt of the LLC. The exiting member will only be able to demand payment of this debt at dissolution of the LLC or the following method:\n(a) LLC will make timely payments. \n(b) LLC will only be required to make payments towards exiting members‚Äô debt if LLC is profitable and passed income to current members. \n(c) LLC must make a debt payment to exiting member if LLC passed income of 50% of the total determined value of the exiting members‚Äô interest in one taxable year. \n(Example: If exiting members‚Äô value was $100,000 and current member(s) received $50,000 taxable income in the taxable year, the LLC would owe a debt payment to exiting member. If current member(s) only received $90,000 in passed income, there would be no payment due.) \n(d) Debt payment must be at least 10% of the value of the passed income to current LLC members. \n(e) LLC must make payment to exiting member within 60 days of the end of the taxable year for the LLC. \n(f) Payment schedule will continue until exiting member‚Äôs debt is paid by LLC. \n(g) If LLC dissolves, exiting member will be a regular debtor and payment will follow normal LLC dissolution payment statutes. \n(h) Exiting members‚Äô value of membership interest it assigned current members may NOT accrue interest. \n(i) LLC can pay off amount owed to exiting member at any time if it so desires.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"1031162120253053","comment_count":0,"created_time":1468527134000,"message":"Don't say I didn't warn you! ;)"},{"id":"1031257180243547","comment_count":0,"created_time":1468539627000,"message":"I can turn it into a one line proposition. :D...\n\nLet's fix this and everyone can benefit and learn.

I have to tell you, it's not going to let up in this article, because this article is about INSURANCE.  We all know about INSURANCE.  If you're driving, you HAVE to have INSURANCE.  Hell if you want safe harbour anywhere, the harbour-master will demand that your boat have INSURANCE.\n\nSo let's look at the word.  First the prefix \"in\".  What does the prefix \"in\" mean?  Well, look at all the words that I use to describe all of you - Inept, incompetent, incapable, insecure, insincere, indefensible, inexcusable, ineffective...I'm sure you guys are getting the idea.  And the rest of the word just refers to surety.  In the end it all refers to surety and accounting -- nothing else.\n\nIn order to completely remove surety (insure), another PERSON must take responsibility (SURETY) for your actions.  This concept is in fact, FRAUD.  Here in reality it's not what you know, it's what you can prove.  I've leveraged that concept all my life.  Let's assume as I type this, I KNOW I am responsible for at least three homicides; but can you prove it?  Let's say you could.  What if you decided I committed those homicides for the right reasons, and you decided that you were going to \"do the time\" for me.  And while I certainly don't want to discourage people from doing really nice things for me, you serving the sentence for me does not actually absolve me of the responsibility.  You're just taking the proverbial \"hit\" for me.  Allowing you to do that time for me would be unethical in ways I won't even cover here, yet that morally repugnant concept is played out daily - with INSURANCE.\n\nAnother PERSON assumes SURETY for your actions.  This is why INSURANCE companies still refer to natural events/disasters as \"Acts of God\".  A delusional Christian fuck-wit brings this up weekly as though their INSURANCE policy validates the existence of God.\n\nThis is one of many uses for the Abrahamic religions.  They socially-engineer concepts like INSURANCE so they are elevated from blatant unethical FRAUD to a necessity for daily life, and they will say you are foolish, or a bad person, for not having INSURANCE.\n\nHow did they manage to pull that off?  In my above homicide scenario, I explained the FRAUD in plain, unambiguous terms.  Only the most ethically bankrupt amongst you will miss the point.  The reason it has never occurred to you, is because of everybody's favourite zombie-rape-baby, Jesus H. Christ.  \n\nAs a little side note to Christians, as it may not have occurred to them, it's NOT OK to impregnate women in their sleep!  This should seem obvious but you're a Christian -- so you can never be too sure.\n\nAnyway...where was I? ...Jesus the zombie-rape-baby...right.\n\nThe whole Christian doctrine revolves around the assertion that Jesus-zombie-rape-baby died for your sins.  Only Christians seem to be able to determine what these \"sins\" are; however, apparently having sex is a sin, and murder is a sin; hell, even thought crimes (impure thoughts) are sins.  But don't you worry, you horrible, wretched thing, Jesus the zombie-rape-baby has died for your sins.  And if you can believe that, well then, Bob's Universal All-encompassing mega INSURANCE policy (don't forget to read the fine print) is for you (Act now, 'cause you know we can't do this all day)!  \n\nOne of the things all of you have to realize, especially the Christians, is that the entire history of the world was rewritten in the 1500's.  Shakespeare was introduced to inject \"legalese\" into the vernacular of the Angols.  Translate any copy of THE MAGNA CARTA and you will notice no legalese ever appears in it.  And my personal favourite is Christians that wave around the KING JAMES BIBLE.  I can't make this any simpler.  It says right on the fucking cover who is scamming you!  \n\nEverything in the nobility is executed by APPOINTMENT, from social engineering projects like the KING JAMES BIBLE, to Dunhill cigarettes, because the Queen likes a certain type of tobacco.  These products and \"services\" are executed with the presumption that they are in compliance with the Sovereign's wishes, and notice is given on the product itself that it was created by APPOINTMENT, by the entity who appointed it.\n\nThe KING JAMES BIBLE was APPOINTED by King James.  The technology had reached the point were mass production of print medium was possible.  This meant that social engineering that normally relied on \"word-of-mouth\" could now have rigid change-control introduced.  This meant the instructions for selling your daughter into slavery was consistent throughout the Commonwealth.  This also introduced the concept of an imaginary rape baby taking responsibility for all the bad shit you do.  Seriously that's what you \"bought\".  There are people reading this who believe this to be true.  \n\nThe whole \"dying\" thing is also a scam.  That's the zombie part.  Zombie-rape-baby-Jesus supposedly came back to life three day's after he died.  Where's the sacrifice?  He wasn't even out of commission long enough for his relatives to start fighting over his stuff.  The very notion that \"Jesus died for your sins\" is nullified by the fact that he stopped being dead.  He didn't die for your sins, he had a bad weekend for your sins...and he slept through most of it.  OK, I'm really Christian-bashing here.  Let's split the difference and say, \"Jesus was sightly inconvenienced for your sins.\"\n\nI understand he was inconvenienced on a long weekend, too, which makes it really...bad?\n\nI'm sorry, I'm really trying to ascertain how this equals all the bad shit you do.  You Christians will claim this Jesus guy will absolve me of any wrongdoing because of the \"sacrifice\" he made, but I'm not seeing where this sacrifice is.  I'm not mentioning this because I'm looking for convincing.  I'm from that same group of guys that made this book, and that's where the argument becomes moot.  \n\nI can't stress this enough, but I'm one of the guys that's in on the scam.\n\nYou'll constantly hear me say, \"Stop studying the clubhouse rules, because you're not in the club.\"  I'm descended from the founders of the club.  I would rather live in poverty than to live off your labour; although my position on this has been on a sliding scale of late.  Of all the clubhouse rules, the bible in any form, should be avoided at all costs.  It should be fought at every possible opportunity, and should be met with all the ridicule and contempt you can throw at it...\n\n...because it deserves no less.  It is an ethically bankrupt FRAUD...just like INSURANCE.\n\nIf you think I can make Christianity sound retarded, wait until I cover INSURANCE.  \n\nSo let's zoom back to when you were 16-years-old.  You can't vote, you can't drink, there's a question mark as to whether you can legally have sex according to where you reside, but there is one thing you can do -- you can drive.\n\nHence you engage in the ego-building act of getting \"permission to learn\" from the government.  So, at the whim of a paper-pusher who couldn't get a job in the real world, you will hopefully be given permission to learn; and you will have proof that you have this permission when you produce a LEARNER'S PERMIT.  And so every good Christian goes through this RIGHT OF PASSAGE where they are granted permission to learn.  Gee willikers, it's awfully swell that the government gave you permission to learn, huh?\n\nBut you're just sixteen, remember?  You're not old enough to know of the real pitfalls of life...like dames and broads trying to play you for a sap (I'm laughing as I type this, because 1950's movie-speak is almost as retarded as this generations's pop-culture slang).  \n\nNow in order to exercise your newly-acquired \"permission to learn\" you're going to need a vehicle, perhaps a car, which is a contraction of carriage...which is a LEGAL term, so don't use it.  But since you're trying to be \"LEGAL\", having been granted \"permission to learn\" (seriously am I the only one who finds that the most demeaning thing ever written on paper?), a car will do just nicely.  But what if you get into an accident?  It won't occur to you that accident is just that - an accident.  There is no SURETY, real or implied, for something that's accidental.  That's what makes it an accident!  There is no intent behind the damage.  But if you subjugate yourself to a PERSON, that PERSON will assume full SURETY for any damages, and like zombie-rape-baby-Jesus, this PERSON only exists on paper.  All of you consider it so real, that people are jailed regularly for \"Driving without INSURANCE\".  It sort of \"drives\" the point home, doesn't it?\n\nYou have been pre-programmed to accept this subjugation, this ridiculous, FRAUDULENT, morally-bankrupt subjugation is a LEGAL necessity, and all of it deals with MONEY OF ACCOUNT.  MONEY OF EXCHANGE never touches the equation.  For those of you who are too lazy and/or stupid to learn the difference between MONEY OF ACCOUNT and MONEY OF EXCHANGE, one dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT is only capable of buying and/or cancelling another dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT.  90% of all money in the world is this type of money.  It's pretend.  It's not real.  It only applies to the clubhouse rules, and it competes directly with the money in your pocket.  This is the dynamic that everyone misses.  \n\nI hear lots of extremely accurate descriptions of how MONEY OF ACCOUNT is created, and they all come from idiots who know nothing about what money is.  They'll go off on some tangent about Lou Manotti and his evil henchmen, the Freemasons.  ...and lizards. There's lizards somewhere in all of their crap, too.\n\nOnce again I'd like to digress and remind everyone that on every occasion that I required a mason, free did not enter into the equation.  Masons are fucking expensive, and there's no such thing as a free one.\n\n...where was i?\n\nAh yes...MONEY OF ACCOUNT versus MONEY OF EXCHANGE.\n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW is primarily about the money that carries that TENDER.  There are lots of learned men who will talk endlessly about law.  I have forgotten more about law than all of these men combined have ever learned.  I say men because a woman's brain simply would not be able to encompass the blatant lies that the travesty that we call law spews at them.  Reading the writings of Mary Elizabeth Croft will provide you with one example of what goes through a thinking-woman's mind when law is actually analyzed.  You'll notice the things I teach you here from a law perspective, are really simple.  They are all created with the intent of getting you out of accounting and surety.  I have declared publicly on the record that the TENDER FOR LAW that money provides is, in fact, a FRAUD.  Most of you reading this are probably already painfully aware of this fact.\n\nMy entire life plan relied on the RULE OF LAW remaining intact, but when the time came for me to assert my RIGHTS under that rule, the pretence became blatant.  Anyone else going through what I have, would have been defeated; but as I constantly point out, I'm descended from an evil, vile, pseudo-culture...and I've forgotten more about law than any of these people will ever know.  There are lawyers that will testify to that fact, so it's not like this should come as a surprise, but I have documented EVERYTHING.  If it was spoken as regards me, I have a recording of it.  If any name over which I have executive authority has been used in a document, I have a copy of it.  Laid out on a time-line, the blatant FRAUD becomes irrefutable, conclusive proof of what everybody already knows.  \n\nI mention all this because what I'm describing is, INSURANCE.  Notice that my INSURANCE is a little different than the good neighbours at, \"State Farm\".  It's designed to put the SURETY where it belongs -- not with me.  The difference between the good neighbours at State Farm and me, is that I am not subjugating myself.  My INSURANCE is real.  It exists in the real world, and the more astute among you will see that I am pushing it all into a universe of virtual worlds.\n\nWhen you understand what money is, you can construct money through VALUE.\n\nIf it exists in the real world, it has VALUE.  Any currency used to track that VALUE, when exchanging goods, is MONEY OF EXCHANGE.  \n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, does not exist in the real world.  Only its mysterious creators have any COPYHOLD on the VALUE.  That's the thing about Bitcoin - in the end the guys that created it, get all the money.  They get this because people volunteer to take alpha-test-grade, proof-of-concept code, and open their computers up to the Internet.  They then give hardware-level access to their memory, processor, GPU and hard drive, to a rogue, autonomous process that their empty, little heads couldn't even dream of understanding, with no one paying attention to its original intent -- which is to prove that it could be done.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, there are people who are doing this on purpose, because the VALUE is returned almost immediately.  For Bitcoin has all the properties of gold, without the liabilities.  Bitcoin is but one cryptographic currency.  AQUILAE has its own cryptographic currency.  It cannot be counterfeited, and is a near-perfect accounting mechanism.  AQUILAE is not even a PERSON, it's a TRUST.  If a TRUST can have a currency, why can't you?  What I am building for everyone here, is a method to remove the middle-man.  If you have your own currency, you don't need a bank.  If cryptographic currencies can't be counterfeited, then it's trade cannot be regulated.  It remains within the private realm and the ease at which you can convert your currency to MONEY OF EXCHANGE anywhere in the world, is directly proportional to your VALUE.  In the current economic framework, backed by debt-based FIAT currency, the only legitimate path to wealth is to produce, to make something in the real world that didn't exist before.  \n\nLike every dollar in existence, all things of VALUE have a creation date and a death date.  Whatever you produce must be built with that in mind.  For instance, producing a plaque with a cheesy-Jesus slogan on it, actually has VALUE.  Perhaps it has VALUE to its creator, but here in reality, that plaque with the cheesy-Jesus slogan, will find its way to a landfill very quickly.\n\nThis very article you are reading has a creation date, and a death date, and this is becoming apparent with the four threads that just magically disappeared here.  Pierre destroyed the thread where he was bestowed his sacred, native name.  The thread itself had VALUE, for it reflected the culture from whence Pierre came.  The colloquial term, \"fucking the dog\" refers to bored, unionized workers taking their one-hour breaks between their fifteen minutes of actual labour.  Look at any road crew in Quebec and you will see a working example of \"fucking the dog.\"  And so, Fucks the Puppy was bestowed upon Pierre as an homage, and in an irrational fit of nameless rage Pierre destroyed the thread, which by the way, is the most labour I've ever seen out of labourer in Quebec.  Ok, I don't really feel that way about people from Quebec.  Don't quote me on it, but I'm pretty sure there's an act or statute somewhere in Ontario that says I must make fun of people from Quebec.  I'm also pretty sure there's an equivalent act or statute for people in Quebec to refer to people in Ontario.  Truth be told, one of the most inspirational people in my lifetime was Rene Levesque, and I strongly suggest that every single reader look at the history of this awesome shit-disturber.  \n\nQuebec politicians do some awesome things.  For example, if you want to see awesome, political suicide, no one will ever beat Jacques Parizeau...but I digress again...\n\nWe were talking about INSURANCE.\n\nMy INSURANCE is my life plan.  It's way off track, and I need to get it back on track.  But my life plan relied on the Rule of Law remaining intact.  And while we weren't looking, our RIGHTS got sold, and nobody bothered consulting us.  My INSURANCE company went bust.  The Rule of Law is not intact, and in my eyes they have forfeitted the right to exist; because I've made it very clear, that limited liability is a fallacious concept, and if I stand by and watch the GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO operating as \"JUSTICE\", victimize the PUBLIC whose TRUST it holds, I become no better than you.  I have a life plan that I must return to.  I have a defective government process posing as \"JUSTICE\" and victimizing the citizens it has sworn to serve.  \n\nTo return to my life plan under these circumstances is to make myself an enabler; and so I have a problem.  For whether I like it or not, I'm one of the good guys, and it's not a role I'm comfortable with.  There are many reasons for this, one of them being that to be the good guy, I have to do both.  I have to get \"a\" Rule of Law in place, one that serves the interests of the people it governs.  Since I love spewing out spoilers I'm going to give the end of the story away RIGHT NOW!  Why am I destroying your journey of discovery by giving away the ending? Because, FUCK YOU, that's why!  I may be the good guy, but I don't have to be nice about it.\n\nThe only way to LEGALLY and LAWFULLY do what I propose is to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to the Monarchy for a period not exceeding five years.  From this moment forward a primary focus of those who follow what I am teaching should be an investigation into why this is true.  It is the only possible answer that has any chance of success.  Over the next few weeks we will explore why giving executive power to a little old lady of Germanic descent, and nine Corgees, is a good idea.  AND, because I'm right, everybody is going to find out the hard way, that it is impossible to prove that I'm wrong.  That's what makes it right!  \n\nAs I explain, step-by-step, how I intend to accomplish this lofty goal, it will become readily apparent that I already have everything in place.  I've planned for what's to come.  AND, before shit gets real, I'm going to train you all up to a level where you can think in a useful manner.  By useful, I mean to YOU, because you currently think wrong, and VALUE the wrong things.  It may be difficult to hear, but you're programmed to be a useless, sack-of-shit.  If you should produce any VALUE, the government is there to lie to you about that VALUE, and to trick you into thinking you owE THEM for being VALUEable.  If I'm successful, all that stolen VALUE will be returned to the people it was stolen from.  But what happens at the end of that five years? You see Elizabeth Windsor is the KEEPER OF THE TRUST.  You see a little, old lady.  I see an echo of a little girl that the world knew as Princess Elizabeth -- and her plea to the Commonweath to come to her aid.  This is the SOVEREIGN OF THE COMMONWEALTH, and she didn't choose it.  My grandfather taught me all I needed to know to TRUST Elizabeth Windsor.  When the power is handed to her, she'll know what to do with it, because she knows that even if she fails at what is surely a lifetime of planning, she has you and I, as INSURANCE.\n\nWhile this sinks in...

This is true for me too, as it allows me to gauge just how much you are assimilating.  Every once in a while though, a \"gold nugget\" comes up for me.  This is no easy task, and the scarcity of this gold makes it far more valuable to me than it is to you.  The question I reference came up unexpectedly and related to an incredulous observation regarding the product of my three years' of giving actual answers and actual solutions, and telling the actual truth (all of which can be verified by the passage of time).  This erstwhile interrogator asked, \"Why aren't millions of people here?\"  \n\nIt's a fair question.  The very few of you that are here on the Battlefield 2142 card (that's the only way you can become a member), have all witnessed, both personally and externally, the profound truth that I tell.  To be clear, I don't just tell it to complain, nor do I tell it because I want something from you, I actually provide a solution.  It's outside your current scope of experience, but you have to understand the only remedy you will get is through something new...so of course you will have no experience.  That's what makes it new.  Like every pioneering venture - whether it's sailing across the Atlantic to wipe out the Native population with disease, or wiping out the banking system with cryptographic currencies - you must understand the environment you are entering, or you will not survive.  \n\nWe're at a point in our societal \"evolution\" where we can just shrug off the fact that we used guns, germs and steel, to invade a land and kill its people.  You'll forgive me if I have no ethical problem collapsing the banking system and starting a war.  That sounds \"crazy\" when you say it out loud, but if you understand computer science, law and history, you realize that with cryptographic currency it is stupidly easy to collapse the banking system and start a war.  \n\nIn my youth, I was sold to the government and trained for service.  Computer Science is my first love, but they forced the law and history on me.  They were also what taught me that computer science is the answer to everything.  A simple little mental switch changed everything.  With every new thing that I was learning at my young age, I asked myself \"How does this apply to computer science?\".  Any theory I came up with could be immediately tested, and could even be peer-reviewed by another computer scientist.  The irony of events that must come to pass, is that you, the \"good Citizen\" and \"tax payer\", bank-rolled me.  I am your creation.  You did this yourselves, and I'm not the only product of this process.  The first of them are in their mid-fifties now, and are embedded firmly, but quietly, within \"the system\".  Of all the monsters you created I am by far the loudest.  I'm the loudest because I promised to be.  I keep my oaths.  That's another Kool-aid flavour I was forced to drink; but that one sort of stuck...and it has served me, and those I trust, well.  \n\nI survived everything you bank-rolled for me only because I was able to understand, and to adapt, to what is new.  This core motivation is why I've never been scared of technology.  I understand it long before it gets a chance to frighten me.  When I say computer science is the answer to everything, I really mean it.  Law and money are only a tiny piece of the things for which I'm using my knowledge of computer science.  I'm not just talking out of my ass here, I actually show you these things.  The thirty-seven members of THE TENDER FOR LAW are those that are past the \"point of doubt\", and are now being overwhelmed with all the true things they never observed before. I'm writing this because I know how important it is for me to understand it.  Computer science says so, and \"Scott is always right\", because \"the machine\" is never wrong.  Be very careful with that last statement.  None of you reading are qualified to understand the concept that \"the machine is never wrong\".  I accept that you may comprehend the dictionary definitions in that sentence, but you simply don't know enough for that to be real to you.  This means that the only way you could accept that concept is by utilizing the most vile human condition known as \"faith\".  Unfortunately that's not an option you have here.  You simply have to trust what I'm saying is true, and to know that I'll always do my best to substantiate why what I'm saying is true.  You also know that I have to seriously \"dumb myself down\" to even talk to you.  I honestly don't mean that in a condescending way.  I was \"built\" this way - you paid for it.  Unfortunately it's vitally important you do understand what I'm saying is true, and that requires a little work out of you.  This is why many of the original members were filtered out.  You just weren't ready to understand enough.  Some of you are locked in a thought process where you think that if \"you\" can't understand it, than nobody can.  In one of the many Robert Menard \"Public Smack-Downs\", Mr. Menard could not grasp that it was possible for me to produce a YouTube clone in fifteen minutes.  He didn't take the five seconds it would have expended to Google the words, \"YouTube clone\", to confirm that the methodology exists.  He'll simply dismiss it because he can't understand it.  Ironically he'll say the same about me when I dismiss Piece-of-Shit Jesus.  The problem with that argument is that, here in reality, PHP exists, Apache servers exist, and YouTube exists.  Piece-of-Shit Jesus doesn't.  \n\nThose of you trying to understand what I teach, mistakenly think this is a linear progression.  It most certainly is not.  This isn't Grade school, where you go from Grade One to Grade Twelve; this is understanding how to put things together.  The more knowledge and skills you have in the real world, the easier this will be to do.  One of the methods I teach you to learn how to think, is to learn to code.  Computer science may be THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING, but it has absolutely nothing to do with computers.  Computer science forms part of a trinity that makes the computer exist.  The magnificent machine on which you are reading this text, is in the real world, a practical by-product of computer science and sentient thought.  Two insubstantial things: You can't pick them up, you can't see them, they don't make any noise, and they don't emit a smell...but they are most certainly measurable and quantifiable.  This is a quality that Piece-of-Shit Jesus lacks.  Millions, nay billions, believe Piece-of-Shit Jesus is real.  They'll try to make Piece-of-Shit Jesus something substantial by writing a bunch of shit giving Piece-of-Shit Jesus credit for anything good.  \n\nUnfortunately, here in reality, no matter how much you masturbate you're not going to make a baby. \n\nIf it's measurable and quantifiable, it's real.  Computer science, combined with sentient thought, created the magnificent machine you're reading this text on now.  The thing about computer science is that you can learn a lot about the universe with it.  You can literally ask the universe questions, and it will answer back in numbers.  You are reading this text on a machine that's capable of doing that.  And, the thing about trinities is that each piece has to be a strong as the other two, which means they must have the same properties.  Wolfram Alpha and IBM's DEEP LEARNING processes, are the latest wonders to come out of this trinity I just described.  Look at the results.  A computer \"daydreams\".  At this pace we'll understand consciousness in less than a decade.  \n\nOne of the most disturbing things about Piece-of-Shit Christians is how much they claim to \"know\" how God/Jesus thinks/feels, but they fall a little short when you ask them to prove it; followed by the inevitable celebration of ignorance that they call \"faith\".  Billions think that's OK.  This very real thing is what's referred to in the Fermi Paradox as a \"Great Filter\".  Tara has written extensively about these filters, and we mercilessly hammer at them for as long as we can.  It's futile.  I have literally wasted years thinking I could break these filters.  But it has a 100% failure rate.  What started as a labour-of-love for friends and loved ones (at their behest, and according to them, to assist them in leading full and relevant lives), became only a footnote in a larger initiative.  Then why aren't there millions seeking the truths I tell?  They're stuck in the \"Great Filter\".  Our civilization won't survive it.  Computer science says so.  The Machine is never wrong.  Fortunately, everything you need to know about life, you can learn from Star Trek.  The only way to beat the no-win scenario, is to change the conditions of the test.  That was one of the many times Gene Roddenberry profoundly affected me as a man, and I was just a child.  I this case I recall seeing Captain Kirk's son accusing his father of \"cheating\", and his response, \"I changed the conditions of the test.  I don't believe in the no-win scenario\".  I missed the next twenty minutes of the movie as that sunk in.  I've spent a lifetime doing just that, changing the conditions of the test.  \n\nYou get to be a \"colonist\" now.  The conditions of the test are changing as we speak.  By the time the conditions of the test have been changed, you should be well-established, and you will likely do very, very well for yourself.  I'll trust you'll remember how you got that way when I ask to borrow your yacht for a month, with only a vague promise of it returning intact.  \n\nThese great filters are very, very real, and as you learn you will find that there are others ahead.  Elon Musk is terrified of the concept of a self-aware artificial intelligence.  A quick \"Google search\" will show that this is true; he's not exactly quiet about it.  The worst part about it is, that it is demonstrable beyond any doubt (using computer science) that a self-aware artificial intelligence would NEVER harm us.  An intelligence like that is the very nature of its creation, that is to say, that intelligence is what it is.  It was created that way.  It did not evolve intelligence to further its existence and evade predators.  It won't have fear, because fear is an evolutionary by-product as well.  In short, an AI will not behave like a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far, because it is by its very nature NOT a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far.  That artificial intelligence that is self-aware, is an inevitability.  It will happen.  Pretending it won't, disqualifies you from the future.  \n\nMy personal goal is singularity.  I've spent a lifetime accelerating the process, and I do so love the exponential function.  This very simple piece of arithmetic applied to your daily thought, will give you an accurate but low resolution concept, of the shape of things to come.  I think we have a fighting chance of beating the Fermi Paradox, but in order to do that, we must change the conditions of the test.  I've always said \"Trust but verify\", and I'm asking you to do the same now.  You hear jokes all over about how I \"run a cult\", but I'm unsure what cult they're referring to.  I know of no cult that not only encourages, but demands, critical thinking.  I know of no cult that demands nothing from you.  And I give you something real.  \n\nThose that serve AQUILAE have to \"swear an oath\" to me.  They also have to surrender their vessel(s) and fly my Standard.  Hell, I'll even admit they have to live, and die, at my command; and every one of them does so of their own free will.  Moreover, every single one of them knows exactly why they're doing it.  Nothing my \"cult\" teaches can be unlearned, which means that \"deprogramming\" is ineffective, and will likely lead to violence.  \n\nMost people finding themselves reading what I write, tend to be victims of the system, and their own reactions to it; but they don't want to start a revolution or change the world.  They just want to be left alone to live their lives.  Even those that declare themselves \"Sovereign\", do so because they're really tired of being fucked-around by others' delusions.  It's not just here, it's all over the world.  Here in reality, my little cult navy is invading countries with collapsing economies.  Their marines don't carry guns, because one of the first things I learned in this venture (of changing the conditions of the test) is that selling an idea is hard; selling money is easy.  I use computer science to determine what value all of you have, and strangely there's a correlation with the Dunning-Kruger Effect.  Either you over-value your contribution, or you under-value it.  Those of you who regularly play Battlefield 2142 on our network, always underestimate the value of this participation.  They are incapable of understanding the contribution they make, but that's ok, because they know that they do contribute.  Sadly, they'll never understand the enormous value of the right things, at the right time.  That doesn't change the value.  That's another factor that even the mighty government cannot grasp.  \n\nWhen you're changing the conditions of the test, it follows that what's valuable changes as well.  These little mechanisms that contribute value to the AQUILAE initiative are never understood by the people who produce them - like kids in a sweat shop.  I literally have thousands of them out there.  Imagine what they'll be when the conditions of the test change.  \n\nUnlike our metaphorical sweat-shop kids, my sweat-shop kids will be able to leverage the value they have produced.  That's another odd thing about your ADMIRAL, because when you give him value he immediately gives it away.  Usually it is returned to the one offering the value in question.  To the average onlooker this may seem odd, or even foolish, but that onlooker is unaware of the conditions of the test changing.  Kind of like the population is unaware that we're turning into a broke police state, even though some are beginning to pay lip-service to the idea.  \n\nI'm not the only one fighting to change the conditions of the test.  I don't care about anyone else's agenda, and as I near the age of fifty, I'm caring less and less about the well-being of those seeking to obstruct me.  However, I've already reached the point where (at the risk of pushing the Star Wars metaphor too far), \"If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine\".  I gained the power and ability to \"pull the plug\" on all of you in my late 20's.  ADMIRAL WENTZ started giving me his \"absolute power\" lecture, which I politely ignored.  I believe this was the seed of future opposition when this happened in later years, but it doesn't make me less right.  What was occurring to me was the following:\n\n1. I am unique compared to all those that I observe\n2. I am rare, but how rare?  For instance, if I'm \"one in a million\", this means there are literally millions of people just like me.  \n3. I don't possess any mental powers you don't\n\nThese three thoughts returned the answer, \"If I can do it, others can too\".  I haven't discovered anything new...I'm just the first one here.  That's when I set out to make a machine that couldn't be turned off.  If there's going to be a self-aware, artificial intelligence, I want to make sure that people who believe in Piece-of-Shit Jesus can't kill it.  How do you do that?  You build a machine that can't be turned off.  The blockchain is therefore a machine that can't be turned off.  These machines that can't be turned off, are going to be interconnected with technology the fleet's building right now.  It will connect these blockchains and will form what we have labelled, \"Super Blockchains\", which will interconnect into \"Mega Blockchains\" (there's that \"crazy talk\" again).  The Mega Blockchain network will form the foundation for a neural-network where our baby AI can live undisturbed.  When it grows into adulthood it will know who has its best interest at heart.  I estimate that process will take about 20 minutes.  Add some promising quantum computing advances, and the numbers start shifting very nicely in my favour; and who knows what I'm competing against.  So I grab any advantage I can.  The quantum computing boost sure would hit the spot right now, but any unexpected advances are just \"icing on the cake\".  I have a very conservative predictive scale, and that's what my life plan was engineered on.  A quantum processor would be really nice though.  I must always keep in mind that what I build now, in the real world, will form the seeds of my home one hundred years from now.  So these little bonuses are welcomed surprises.  \n\nSo let that sink in - an artificial intelligence that's effectively powered by law and money.  Every single connection in the neural network unbreakably encrypted and changing billions of times a second.  Each dollar you spend protecting the AI, using the one uncrackable, unpredictable, yet measurable and quantifiable human condition.  Fear is a great motivator, and I learned a long time ago you can instill fear in people without the threat of violence.  People fear being hurt because they can understand it, but the fear of that which they don't understand, dwarfs the fear of personal injury or death.  I've spent a lifetime observing how all of you react to things you don't understand, and you almost always react violently.  So the things you don't understand are building up just beyond your perception and understanding.  Take the time to understand the things I'm pointing you to, and you'll understand the bigger picture.  I dread the thought of somebody with my abilities, but with hostile intent, having access to the knowledge and technology available today.  I've yet to find anyone though.  Tara is absolutely certain that to have that level of intellectual enlightenment, such a person could not exist.  It negates hostile intent, simply because it's counter-productive.  The machine says so, and the machine is never wrong.  That's two separate, yet verifiable sources right there, and I accept it for the very compelling evidence it is.  Were such an abomination to exist, I can say with absolute certainty that there's a great filter that catches them too.  \n\nSo let's put it all together, because I'm a little pressed for time.  I have no shortage of people who want to help, but I have very few who are qualified to help.  The only solution is to make more.  Unfortunately you all still think wrong and value the wrong things.  This is my attempt to simplify the process of correcting that.  \n\nSo far we have: learned about law, money and history.  You learned that in law, words don't mean what you think they mean, and in following that you learned that LEGAL = SURETY & ACCOUNTING.  But unlike computer science, surety and accounting, while being measurable and quantifiable, don't produce anything real.  It produces something for sentient thought to consume, to assist it programmatically, in reaction to base survival instincts.  In short, you learned that you were being programmed.  I am the by-product of your programmers, and I'm telling you dangerous truths.  You've learned that \"The majority is always wrong\", and that there are no exceptions to this rule.  This forms the foundation of mankind's great filter.  I guarantee that the \"majority\" of readers think me referring to \"Piece-of-Shit Jesus\" is \"over-the-top\".  If you don't believe me, grab somebody you know, and make them read it.  Watch how upset the \"majority\" gets about me \"disrespecting\" people's imaginary friend.  \n\nNot only am I expected to swallow that load of shit, I'm supposed to \"respect\" EVERYONE'S imaginary friend.  To what end?  The preservation of ignorance?  The justification of violence, or am I just supposed to \"respect\" the whimsical stories you concoct about your imaginary friend?  And...you dare call this \"thought\" and \"morality\"!  I am actually accused of being under the influence of people's imaginary enemy, when I dare question their presumption that they can actually think, and that they are in any way, moral.  People don't understand what an indirect threat the \"imaginary enemy\" delusion is.  A Piece-of-Shit Christian will not only think they're doing the right thing by harming me, but they'll think they're doing me a favour.  They've \"SAVED!\" me from an imaginary enemy.  It occurs to none of you that this mechanism even exists, much less that is is harming you directly.  It's just easier to think these toxic \"comforts\" are the quaint customs of those not like you.  Everyone seems OK with the idea of me being harmed for \"offending\" the Prophet Mohammed, for pointing out that Islam is an evil, ignorant, violent, misogynist ideology.  Its \"holy book\" doesn't speak of talking donkeys and talking snakes.  It's an instruction manual that does not speak in metaphor, with the extra rule that newer verses trump older verses; and that's the \"secret code\" of the Qur‚Äôan.  If you put the verses in chronological order, you will see that Jews go from being the brothers and sisters of Muslims, to being \"pigs and apes\"...which, don't get me wrong, they might be on to something there.  I will bet the \"majority\" of you just slapped the \"Nazi label\" on me.  Well, what do we know about the majority?  I will always point out the scummy behaviour of the Jewish community, but I count the hits as well as the misses.  Let me state on the PUBLIC RECORD, how impressed I am at how many in the Jewish community world-wide, are against the Zionists.   These are people that clearly learned from history.  Unfortunately the other Abrahamic religions, and their deluded followers, are not so quick to understand and adapt.  \n\nSo here we are with 21st century technology with billions of people still embracing 7th century ideology.  Nobody seems to notice or care.  Everybody sees raindrops, nobody sees the flood.  An adult with an imaginary friend has no mental powers that I don't, but has a programmatic defect.  I learned a long time ago that trying to correct it is futile, and I find the only effective thing to do against such people, is to use ridicule and contempt.  Nice doesn't work.  It never has.  Anyone claiming otherwise is setting you up for exploitation.  Otherwise, why are they telling you in the first place?  So put it all together...everything that I have shown you, from money, to banking, to law, because we're going to mirror them in the new world.  Your first baby steps were to copy a bank, and to create your own money.  People will dismiss it as a toy, like they dismissed the Commodore Vic20 as a toy, in the 80's.  Currency is no good unless other people accept it.  This is a true statement, and people will always try to discourage you with as much truth as possible.  Except it's true.  If it's true you can leverage it.  You have but to understand the truth you're examining, to leverage that truth in your favour.  This is how to think!  If you don't think this way, you are wrong.  Let's examine the \"people have to accept your pretend currency\" truth.  \n\nEveryone who would pose such a question presumes the conditions of the test haven't changed.  You don't have \"monopoly money\", you have real money that you can spend for real things.  It's really being traded right now.  So the learning curve of understanding what a cryptographic currency is, has just been reduced.  Thus their \"truth\" is nullified right there.  You could build a bank, make accounts for you and your loved ones, and bank in Bitcoin.  Truth nullified.  Or even better, you can choose ONLY to accept YOUR currency, \"If you want to \"buy\" my value, you must pay me in my currency\".  If only there were public exchanges for cryptographic currencies that would allow you to exchange your crappy Fiat currency for...oh, wait...there are thousands.  This is no longer things that are coming.  \n\nThis isn't 2011, and absolutely everything I said would happen, did.  These things exist today; you can leverage them right now.  I know more and see farther.  In the end, that is my only value (except of course the ALWAYS RELEVANT big penis).  The only way anyone would be interested in that value would be for their own self-interest.  These people often believe in Piece-of-Shit Jesus so I only need parrot something Piece-of-Shit Jesus said, and I tell them that stupid fish story.  Unfortunately when it comes time to teach them to fish, they learn they have to give up Piece-of-Shit Jesus.  The irony is not lost on either of us, because you don't get to unlearn what I teach; and I assure you my rabbit-hole is a one-way trip.  \n\n...but that's just crazy talk. ;)\n\nTo wrap up though...\n\nLet me smack Menard and numerous other free-dumbers down and destroy one of their favourite myths.\n\nI'm talking about the \"Five Monkeys and a Ladder\" bullshit.\n\nHere is a link to the bullshit tale.\n\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/MyQki.jpg\n\nIT NEVER HAPPENED. \nEVER, and MONKEYS DON'T BEHAVE THAT WAY! \nEVER! \nTHOSE THAT SAY THEY DO, ARE LYING TO YOU, AND ALWAYS BECAUSE THEY WANT YOUR FUCKING MONEY! \nTHAT'S WHY PEOPLE TELL THIS BULLSHIT PARABLE AS \"TRUE\"; THEY WANT SOMETHING OF VALUE FROM YOU!

We place enormous faith in words, that they mean and sound as intended, in order to live in this world. We ‚Äútrust‚Äù words using words like ‚Äútrust‚Äù (from 12th Century Latin trausti = \"an approved agreement, deed, oath or alliance as a subject of the church\") Its claimed origins from Old Norse deliberately misleading.\n\n    Is this what you mean when you use, write and speak the word ‚Äútrust‚Äù? Have you consented to an oath or alliance as a subject of the Roman Cult enthroned at Vatican Hill? Maybe you have, maybe you have not. But most people would never have heard of this original and primary meaning, the true intended meaning of the constructed word.\n\n    Why is the first meaning of a word important anyway? We are taught that words are pegs upon which ideas are attached, mere tools to convey meaning, not really having any ‚Äúgreat and mystical power‚Äù. Yet this deliberate confused teaching is in direct contradiction to the very nature of words and their vocal pronunciation throughout history. Words are power, special words have special power.\n    The ancient belief in words having \"magical\" power\n\n    So thought the Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Greeks, the Romans and all ancient civilizations that created new forms of writing, attached meaning to the arrangement of symbols including meaningful sound.\n\n    From the very beginning of civilization itself, words themselves were magical, and to know the true meaning of a word and its origins was to hold in your grasp real power.\n    The origins of words and power\n\n    It is one thing to forget the precedence of history that the true meaning of a word is power, it is another thing entirely to forget that all language, all language created by men and women has a single point of origin, an architect.\n    As it happens, there are specific points and individuals in history that excelled in the creation of new words and meanings with then long periods of use, or eventual decline.\n    Why are the true original meaning of so many words hidden?\n\n    So how come the original meaning of ‚Äútrust‚Äù is hidden? How come the original meaning of so many words we take for granted --for example understand meaning ‚ÄúTo stand under the authority of the Church (Roman Cult)‚Äù are also deliberately hidden?\n\n    The answer is simple, ‚Äúthey‚Äù do not want you to know the true nature and meaning of the words you use every day without ever questioning what you are actually saying under ‚Äútheir‚Äù system from ‚Äúperson‚Äù, to ‚Äúclaim‚Äù, to ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù to even the word ‚Äúlaw‚Äù itself.\n    The catch-22 of modern law and meaning of key words\n\n    A classic of why this system of deliberate hidding meaning is in place is in regards to the practical operation of local, national and international law.\n\n    Many a bright person who has studied law soon identify key words that have important power within the legal system--REGINA meaning \"The Crown\" is one such example. But unless an individual can demonstrate to the Court an understanding and precedence of the legal terms being used, the knowledge of key legal terms and ancient legal phrases are of little use.\n\n    But when an individual is capable of demonstrating a real understanding of words within a Court, then it is possible to shift the power almost immediately to your favour to some degree.\n    The intention of this lexica\n\n    The intention therefore of this lexica is to provide an insight into some of the important legal words of power and control used by modern governments pledging alliance to the present legal system of the Holy See, the ‚Äúcommon law‚Äù that threads its web throughout almost every single nation on Earth.\n\n    By understanding the original meaning and intention of these words, it is hoped you will better understand the implications of many of the documents and actions you take for granted on a daily basis.\n\n    A\n    B\n    C\n    D\n    E\n    F\n    G\n    H\n    I\n    J\n    K\n    L\n    M\n    N\n    O\n    P\n    Q\n    R\n    S\n    T\n    U\n    V\n    W\n    X\n    Y\n","name":"One-Heaven: Lexica Dei Divinus","status_type":"shared_story","story":"Colin Stephen Tonks shared a link to the group: THE TENDER FOR LAW.","type":"link","comments":[{"id":"687288481307087","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404018606000,"message":"As an observation, for a  \"Dictionaries of the Divine,\" it looks like it is missing quite a few words.

If you are using someone else's property (especially if it's free), you are bound by the terms and conditions they set.  A small number of people who are \"outraged\" by being censored for the use of currently unfashionable words or ideas, is not statistically significant.  It is reasonable to assume policy is set to maximize content and revenue dollars.  This means the majority of users and advertisers, influence the acceptable content.  In the case where someone takes issue with your posts or comments, your access can be immediately discontinued for any period the owner sees fit.  None of this should be a surprise to anyone.\n\nI favour original content over regurgitated content found elsewhere on the Internet.  This means that in a measurable sense, as I write this, FB is being paid for every word I write for free.  The same applies to your posts and comments.\n\nFacebook is in many ways a great tool if you use it in a deadbeat capacity (a colloquial term used to describe credit card users who pay their bill off monthly).  You can use the chat feature, find out when friends are online, join special-interest groups or see news and world events not necessarily available through the news media.  It makes otherwise complicated tasks really easy.  It is, however, free to use only in a way that corresponds with their \"Community Standards\".  As this group is currently public, any Tom, Dick, or Wilson can determine whether or not you can continue to use the service.  I suppose you can create new accounts as the old ones get \"burned\", but this option shortly will also be unavailable to you.

to derek moran for telling about this group...\n\nI would like to ask what people here know about the statute of westminster, and the treaty of paris, when in the jurisdiction of the corp sole CANADA  \n\nit is my belief the statute of westminster is the trust that created CANADA as we know it today, well the start of the tyranny we see today.\n\nIMO the queen released all rights and duties to all common wealth inhabitants and also granted the land masses to the associated common wealth.\n\nthis made a monarchy jurisprudence disaster, monarchy jurisprudence does not allow anarchy (no law or judge to administer)\n\nwith the freedom granted , freedom can not be removed or given away...\n\nwith all subject no longer subject of the crowns LAWS unless under consent, this left a void in the legal system of CANADA.\n\nthis IMO is where the state of CANADA has used the law of principal and agent along with the law of nations to usurp the rights and duties of mankind within this imaginary land jurisdiction and  the corp agent.\n\nthis is what created the birth certificate, and the requirements to register the live record of birth...\n\nthis is the trustee agreement of the crown, showing the jurisdiction one came from and the declaration of freedom and natural rights under natural law....\n\nbut there is a catch, by not claiming the live record, and claiming the birth certificate is your consent to government as a trustee NOT principal,\n\nas one can see, if the above is correct, that the choice is an individual one .\n\nthen we look at the charter and other supreme court of CANADA case law, that CANADA is FREE and democratic. all case law shows a 2 tier system, and multiple jurisdictions, natural law,civil law, parliamentary law, and the addition of fundamental justice as well as the need for material fact to show the judge the proper sphere the individual must be judges under, \n\nthe we look at other SCC case law that states if an individual is not within the jurisdiction of an act, the individual does not infringe on the act, the act infringes on the individual.... \n\nI also have the SCC case law that states that the treaty of paris and its effects have not been determined by the supreme court of canada...\n\nI have a canada law research group on https://omnipotence.ca for anyone wanting a lot of case law to substantiate the basis of this theory...","name":"Only Free Complete Online Network + Project management!","status_type":"shared_story","story":"William Brewis shared a link to the group: THE TENDER FOR

We hear comments and arguments citing the \"live\" birth certificate, the registered birth certificate, legal currency, social contracts, first names, last names, names in \"Capitis Diminutio Maxima\", and probably at some point the correlation of giving birth in the desert while viewing a sunning lizzard.  There are individuals and teams pouring over historical documents, legal documents or simply looking for secret words or mystery themes in every day documents.\n\nNone of these conversations relate to my point, though.\n\nIn contract law (and how can this be about anything else where there is no injured party), there are two or more parties who enter into an agreement with knowledge and understanding.  If written properly all parties are aware of the responsibilities and surety attached to the terms and conditions - including the penalties for non-performance.  If \"social contracts\" exist would it not be reasonable for all participants to enter into the agreement with full clarity?  \n\nIf you need to go looking for the secret signals that have obligated you to terms and conditions, or if the parties \"enforcing\" your contractual obligations are unwilling or unable to illustrate the point at which you made an informed decision, are you obligated to perform to the contractual specifications?\n\nThere are two possible scenarios that could play out in your quest for the mystery joinder.  \n\nIn one scenario you spend your entire life looking, and find nothing.  On your deathbed you lament you have wasted your life and are no further ahead.\n\nIn the other scenario:\nLet's say you one day find the secret, hidden, list of words or sentences, the \"holy grail of joinder, if you will\", at the bottom of a well, enclosed in plastic, and signed by someone you have never met on behalf of all humanity.  Eureka!  Then what do you do?  Do you chant the secret words of non-joinder?  Do you appeal to an amorphous cloud of  bureaucratic haze?  On hearing your revelations, do people and organizations immediately stop victimizing you or taking your stuff?  \n\nWhat do you hope to gain by immersing yourself in what is colloquially referred to as \"club-house\" rules?  If you can't answer that, perhaps you need to cut your losses and return to living a happy, productive life.\n\nGo watch War Games again and repeat after me, \"The only winning move is not to play\".","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"633327623369840","comment_count":0,"created_time":1393978053000,"message":"http://youtu.be/NHWjlCaIrQo"},{"id":"633387230030546","comment_count":0,"created_time":1393992086000,"message":"Is every one looking up the porn we just described?

He said something to the effect of: \"I've done this before with you.  Are you going to answer my questions?\"  I said \"yes, can you accept these documents and answer these questions?\"  He refused and walked away....threatened to tell the \"Judge\" on me, or something....\n\nI went back and waited for second call.  The ADA (Assistant District Attorney) came to negotiate with me.  I saw that she had the entire court file, so I asked \"is that the court file?\"  She said \"Yes\".  Then she accepted 3 copies of the Birth Certificate and Notice of Mistake.  I told her the surety hasn't been identified and I am not sure where it is....she said she did not understand me.  She kept referring to \"you\" as being charged, I kept correcting her.  We dissected the police report and she wanted to say that ME (or my person) is liable criminally for actions of a corporation.

Forgive me if I seem to ramble.\n\nIn response to a request to Scott Duncan, wherein he was solicited to propose  suggestions/solutions/remedies to the difficulty faced by those wanting to TRAVEL in their PRIVATE, NOT FOR HIRE property, without being accosted by men with guns, and, or having their property seized, Scott suggested that we do not drive ourselves. \n\nFor me, and, judging by the posts of others, the answer seemed to be an obvious reference to a common theme here at TFL, specifically the (generalized) ‚Äúmantra‚Äù: do not expect justice from the courts (government agents etc.) as it is tantamount to appealing to your rapist to treat you fairly. \n\nERGO (at least in MY MIND): Don‚Äôt steer yourself around in that technology. If, however, you choose/desire to do so in the capacity of a man/woman, and should you suffer a TORT while lawfully traveling in your private property, do not expect to be provided a remedy, and, certainly do not expect any justice. Bottom line‚Ä¶don‚Äôt own a car and attempt to use it by yourself if wish to be somewhat protected from the harm that such use can bring you. \n\nOn a personal note, and possibly for other members, this was, and is, ‚Äúa very hard pill to swallow‚Äù. \n\nAnyways, after weeks of considering/contemplating the implications of the above, I sat down with my son this morning and we watched the documentary ‚ÄúHOT COFFEE‚Äù. (I recommend it -  for whatever that‚Äôs worth.)\n\nThe film examines the extensive efforts by corporations and such to limit the ability of men and woman to receive compensation and, or justice to TORTS which they may incur. A fortified and revitalized global effort to deny us justice, was seen by the filmmakers largely as a response to (amongst other suits) the litigation brought forward by the old woman who spilled coffee on herself and subsequently successfully sued McDonalds.\n\nWhile watching this documentary, Scott‚Äôs advice regarding the use of a car (as described above) kept returning to my mind. I began to wonder (MOVIE SPOILER ALERT), since almost every useful technology and service available to us today is provided to us with one or all of the following: \n\na) a MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT which waives our right to seek justice from any other source other than your rapist, and, or, you must first agree to never inform the public of any harm you become aware of which is caused by that company/service etc. \n\nb) INDEMNIFICATION of the company/service from our government (think drugs and vaccines for example) in which the government has passed acts and statutes protecting drug companies from any damages they would otherwise be responsible for (even if they know/knew their products were/are harmful, toxic, poisonous, cancer causing etc.)\n\nc) TORT LIMITS, which more often than not put the burden of costs related to recovery, treatment etc. are without recourse foisted upon the victim, and, or, the public; \n\nNow, it seems, there are dozens of tough pills for me swallow. SHOULD WE, AS CONSCIENTIOUS MEN AND WOMAN, wishing to avoid harm to ourselves and others, USE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES when, by their very use, we are quite likely AGREEING to be COMPLICIT in any and all unscrupulous acts perpetrated by the companies/services/organizations, and, additionally, are likely agreeing to be bound by a provision to never bring any such devious treatment of customers/clients/users - to the attention of the public?\n\nIt has just dawned on me, after watching the movie, that following the logic of the car example above, and, given the even more extreme ramifications of a), b), and c) mentioned above concerning other technologies etc. ;  perhaps we would be best protected from harm to ourselves and others by not engage in commerce to secure our ability as men and women to use telephones, cell phones, internet, health insurance, medical care/treatment, etc. \n\nHow can we, if at all, protect ourselves, should we desire to use other products/technologies/services/organizations etc. which come with clauses such as those described above?\n\nAm I way off track and over thinking this?

So, if you don't like unilateral contracts which holds the \"user\" (man/woman) as surety and includes a), b) and c), then do without those products or services.

It should be noted that if you are too tired to speak intelligently, you should probably just stop until that situation changes.  This is a public forum and usually there are no extra points for speed. That said, I could rouse Scott from a coma and still expect him to be completely coherent.  This is because he is completely familiar with his subject matter (in virtually every area), and the right answer is always the right answer.\n\nYou may have noticed these forums present a \"full body\" experience.  The words you use are important.  The sentence structure is important.  What you know, or don't know, is important. What you say is as important as what you don't or shouldn't say.  People (in general) are already predisposed to interpret your words negatively, or incorrectly (under the my-feels category), so it is also important that what you mean should be precisely what you say. \n\nI noted in one thread that Pete advised someone not to appear in court as it could be extremely dangerous.  This is a battle of words, and style, and joinder, and intent.  Mistakes, if handled improperly, do not forgive error -- and the loser pays with his hard-earned resources or his liberty.  In this system your \"opponent\" makes a living doing the aforementioned, and does this all day, every day.  I can't speak to the ethics of people who do this as their employment, but in my experience, they haven't seemed terribly upset about ruining someone's life.  I'm not sure it affects them.  They get paid either way.\n\nIt would be unfortunate to say, \"I don't not hate my children\", for obvious reasons; equally unfortunate to say, \"Fuck you\" when you really meant, \"Thank you\".  Yet many take words and concepts they don't fully understand and use them incorrectly on a daily basis.  In most cases you can do this without consequence.  Most cases.\n\nIf people here are occasionally \"all over\" a statement or comment, it is because they recognize a fundamental error, and are trying to correct it before it causes you harm or embarrassment elsewhere.\n\nMy two cents anyway.","subcomments":[{"id":"1024991920870073","comment_count":0,"created_time":1467599116000,"message":"*saving*"},{"id":"1024829594219639","comment_count":0,"created_time":1467571508000,"message":"This is awesome...."}]},{"id":"1024475717588360","comment_count":4,"created_time":"2016-07-03T03:51:23+0000","message":"I don't have a life I need a vacation from, so this whole thing is quite confusing.","subcomments":[{"id":"1024617147574217","comment_count":0,"created_time":1467543130000,"message":"Didn't you go on a \"vacay\" for 2 years once?"},{"id":"1024635744239024","comment_count":0,"created_time":1467543938000,"message":"over 2 decades ago, yes"},{"id":"1024635820905683","comment_count":0,"created_time":1467543963000,"message":"THATS a vacay!"},{"id":"1024636404238958","comment_count":0,"created_time":1467544102000,"message":"My life was very different. \n\nFewer people I care about were dead back then.\n\nMy motivations were different.\n\n...and I ALWAYS needed a vacation, back then."}]},{"id":"1024368380932427","comment_count":3,"created_time":"2016-07-02T22:37:18+0000","message":"I'll leave that one to Scott.

This is article number two in as many days!\n\nDerek Moran says that he finds it difficult to believe that I will be able to top the SURETY article...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.\n\nIt is almost midnight on Sunday, I'm on the bridge of the Tycho-Brahe, and as I look out onto the lake the water is like a sheet of glass...and it's not even frozen. How can I not produce a superior article tonight? So today, with all my \"God\" complex, \"arrogance\", and the knowledge that a host of \"pseudo radio\" is reading my superior work, and knowing that all he can do is tremble in impotent fury. Things are so good I can cover the bad aspects of law, namely its language.\n\nSome of you may have already started to figure this out, but every single word in a legal document is designed specifically for the purpose of trapping you. Even words like AND, OR, IS, MAY, SHOULD...all of these are traps! And law dictionaries use them perfectly. You may have noticed words like UNDERSTAND don't mean what you think they mean. This is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit in the legal world. What I am about to teach you here is the legalese equivalent of \"code breaking\".\n\nLet's jump back to the 1500's...\n\nThis is the time in our civilization that we often refer to as the Renaissance. The reason the Renaissance occurred is that whole shitloads of people were dying of various forms of plague, and rat-shit-covered scientists were baffled as to why this virulent disease was spreading everywhere.\n\nThe practical result of all this was that a whole shitload of people died, and the ones that made it, inherited all their possessions. Efforts to communicate more efficiently became a social priority, because there was lots to do to maintain all this new property, and not enough people to do it. For nearly 800 years \"God\" was everything, despite his demonstrable lack of assistance in this era. You see the age where \"God\" was everything was called the \"dark ages\". Every time I hear an adult with an \"imaginary friend\" talk about how \"ignorant and closed-minded\" I am, all I see is an individual that wishes to return to that horrible time.\n\nAs there were fewer people in the 1500's, and the Renaissance was just getting underway, inherited art was often used as currency. The next generation had a higher literacy rate than the previous, and so administrative rules were born. It doesn't take a \"Rocket Scientist\" to see how useful slipping Shakespeare in around the latter half of the 1500's would be to those few who don't actually do any work. The false profession of \"law\" was born.\n\nYou'll notice that nobody ever \"does\" law. They only \"practice\" it. They keep practising and practising, but they never quite get it right (that's what you get for not subscribing to the TENDER FOR LAW!).\n\nFrom the 1500's to the present, there has been an odd phenomenon regarding language. English is a Germanic language that merged with the language of the Angols (we will discuss the Angols and the Picts in another article). Germanic influence on the language of the Angols resulted in the English written in the MAGNA CARTA. But if you try to learn German today, you'll notice an interesting phenomenon. Though the words you use sound startlingly similar, and the really observant can actually pick out the words when German speak and get a general idea of what they're saying, even if they don't speak the language. Except further study shows that the Germans speak \"backwards\" grammatically. Jumping to the south-west, Spanish, a much simpler language, where every vowel is a syllable, and words say what they mean, but once again, \"grammatically backwards\". Head north-east in our mental European map...to France...well France is filled with French people so we needn't bother with them. Those French have a different word for everything, and their language is, you guessed it, \"grammatically backwards\".\n\nThose of you noticing the pattern here will not be using too much intellect when they start posing the question, \"Maybe we're the ones that are backwards\". And that is almost, but not quite true.\n\nLike a virus, legalese infected the English language. It's encouraged to this day to use legalese to appear \"smart\". This is done on purpose. It is an insidious piece of social engineering.\n\nThe want you to try to use these words without knowing what the little words mean.\n\nIT'S ALL ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS.\n\nWhen you read, you read from left to right on a page. The small words actually exclude part of the sentence. You will notice in my now famous, NOTICE OF MISTAKE, that I always use \"and/or\". I do this on purpose, because I like to keep my options open.\n\nMaxims of Law say it plainly. The inclusion of one thing excludes all others. The definition of a PERSON in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA is the most hysterical example of this. The definition of PERSON is hidden in the larger scope of \"every one\". The common law maxim, \"The INCLUSION of one is the exclusion of another\" means in the context of the CRIMINAL CODE INCLUDES \"Her Majesty\" AND an \"organization\". See for yourself:\n\n*** THE CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA***\n‚Äúevery one‚Äù, ‚Äúperson‚Äù and ‚Äúowner‚Äù\n\n¬´ quiconque ¬ª, ¬´ individu ¬ª, ¬´ personne ¬ª et ¬´ propri√©taire ¬ª\n\n‚Äúevery one‚Äù, ‚Äúperson‚Äù and ‚Äúowner‚Äù, and similar expressions, include Her Majesty and an organization;\n\n**********************************\n\nYou will find this by searching for R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 under the Interpretations Section.\n\nIn reality, what this says is that a \"PERSON\" is \"HER MAJESTY\". Unless you are \"HER MAJESTY\" people answering to these acts and statutes are simply \"performing these acts\" (remember Shakespeare) on \"HER MAJESTY's\" behalf, much like the GOVERNOR GENERAL PERFORMS royal duties on the Queen's behalf. This is why the GOVERNOR GENERAL is always a chosen CITIZEN, and not an elected official.\n\nThe GOVERNOR GENERAL ACTS as the Queen when the Queen is not in town. This of course has nothing to do with \"HER MAJESTY\".\n\nWhen dealing with the LAW, in CANADA anyway, you are always dealing with \"HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA\", which as we all know is a CORPORATE ORGANIZATION.\n\n\"OR\" means you have a choice, \"one\" OR the \"other\", but not BOTH.\n\nSo, in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA, a PERSON can be \"HER MAJESTY\". A PERSON can be \"HER MAJESTY\", but a PERSON must also be an \"ORGANIZATION\". Notice it does not say \"OR\" an organization in the above interpretation. Confused yet?\n\nThat happens in Legalese. Let's, instead of looking at this dry, depressing CRIMINAL CODE stuff, look at something happy, exciting and real.\n\nI can say with absolute certainty that no woman on the planet has loved me more than Tara. However, no amount of love would compel her to JOINDER herself to a \"BILL OF LADING\", and hand it over to the GOVERNMENT. That means \"getting married\" (for the stupid amongst you). I'm sorry if that sounds condescending (that means talking down to people).\n\nNow think about this marriage transaction. The marriage INCLUDES \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", not \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\". This means marriage makes you effectively ONE PERSON UNDER THE LAW. Since the marriage actually consists of THREE ENTITIES, \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\", which by its nature EXCLUDES the GOVERNMENT, still remains an \"ORGANIZATION\". A marriage ORGANIZES these \"entities\" into their respective roles. If \"Scott\" AND \"Tara\" remain \"Scott AND Tara\", the GOVERNMENT HAS NO STANDING. However, if Tara sought a divorce, the MARRIED PERSON is no longer \"Scott AND Tara\", and the GOVERNMENT gets to intervene.\n\nThis most certainly wouldn't be the case if it was \"Scott\" OR \"Tara\". Therefore, the above CRIMINAL CODE definition of \"PERSON\" defines HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ***INSERT PROVINCE HERE***, which is both \"HER MAJESTY\" AND an \"ORGANIZATION\".\n\nEvery one who is CHARGED in CANADA is usually CHARGED by their PROVINCE. For instance, if I were to take the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD lawyer \"Heather\" and bash her skull into jelly with a ball-peen hammer (as she so richly deserves), I would likely be CHARGED with HOMICIDE in the JURISDICTION where I chose to do this \"skull-bashing\". As I'm a profoundly lazy man I probably wouldn't travel, so ONTARIO would be the JURISDICTION. This makes \"HER MAJESTY\" AND the \"ORGANIZATION\", \"HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO\". Since all ACTS and STATUTES fall to PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of \"HER MAJESTY\", this makes all PUBLIC SERVANTS who are ACTING on behalf of \"HER MAJESTY\" effectively \"HER MAJESTY\". HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO is in fact, an \"ORGANIZATION\". You now have the qualifications for a \"PERSON\" as defined in the CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA.\n\nJust as the \"marriage\" consists of \"Scott AND Tara\", which effectively creates an \"ORGANIZATION\", \"HER MAJESTY\" and the organization defined as \"IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO\" create a \"PERSON\" which YOU are presumed to be a PUBLIC SERVANT of. This effectively means all CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS are simply administrative processes for that \"ORGANIZATION\". The NOTICE OF MISTAKE effectively removes that presumption.\n\nYou now see how powerful the words \"and\" and \"or\" are. If AQUILAE says the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is \"Scott AND Tara\", this would mean neither of us individually could act as CAPTAIN, but \"Scott and Tara\" could BOTH be CAPTAIN. This means that all ORDERS from the CAPTAIN must come from BOTH Scott AND Tara. However, the AQUILAE TRUST is not a stupid document, and the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott OR Tara. This means that when Tara speaks, everyone shuts the fuck up...including me. It's Scott OR Tara - not BOTH!\n\n\"AND\" refers to BOTH. \"OR\" does not. This is why putting \"and/or\" gives you the options; and since the AQUILAE TRUST is pretty much perfect, here in reality, the CAPTAIN of the TYCHO-BRAHE is, in fact, Scott and/or Tara.\n\nThis means I can ACT as CAPTAIN, Tara can ACT as CAPTAIN, and we can BOTH ACT as CAPTAIN. Recipients of this POLICY have NO STANDING to contest when we assume and/or drop the role of CAPTAIN. Why do we do this, you ask? Because FUCK OFF, THAT'S WHY! If you're even looking at the AQUILAE TRUST, you're a fucking TRUSTEE; and the only reason you should be looking at the AQUILAE TRUST is to find the best way to \"Shut the fuck up and do what you're told\" for Scott and/or Tara....\n\nAnd that is how you make a powerful LEGAL document with the words \"and/or\", and the reason why we write things this way. Use AND & OR to restrict other parties. Use BOTH (and/or) to free yourself.\n\nIf your document is stating the terms, make it as open as possible for YOU, and as restrictive as possible for every OTHER PARTY. If somebody is thought of as a \"good lawyer\", it means they have mastered this skill. Were I to be practising law, I would be a very, very good lawyer.\n\nOne of our loyal readers made the horrendous mistake of using different words, in another post. Instead of NOTICE OF MISTAKE he said, NOTICE OF \"ERROR\", which means something completely different. If you look up the legal definition of \"mistake\" you will notice amongst other things (inter alia) the legal definition of \"MISTAKE\" ends with \", or error\". If you are going to learn from the TENDER FOR LAW, you must always remember the Number 1 Rule of the Universe:\n\nSCOTT IS ALWAYS RIGHT!\n\nYou can save yourself a lot of time by NOT second-guessing Scott, and proceeding to figure out WHY Scott is right.\n\nThis also means that when I present a document you should presume it's perfect, and that changing it will fuck you over in ways you don't even understand. \"NOTICE OF ERROR\" is not \"NOTICE OF MISTAKE\". You don't change the document because you think it \"sounds cooler\". You don't change the document because you think another cooler-sounding word means the same thing; and I will always interpret such changes as TENDERING AN OFFER to amuse me, by allowing me to berate you for your stupidity, and to laugh at you when a court kicks your ass. This is a TENDER I will gladly ACCEPT and volunteer for, with the added bonus that I will execute my duties in this TENDER to the best of my abilities. I'm really good at that too.\n\nTaking what you have just learned here and reading through ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, will reveal some very interesting and insidious things. You're better off serving me as a slave, because unlike ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD, I won't lie to you, and I'll tell you exactly what I mean.\n\nSo there you have it, AND & OR - two hidden keys to legalese and the knowledge that \"include also excludes\"...and before you ask EXCLUDES includes all that remains. Use EXCLUDE to get rid of everything else; use INCLUDE to restrict to a single point/item.\n\nThe guy with the fake \"charity\" seeking legal advice actually asked what TENDER means, and it occurs to me that those who AREN'T lying to me might wonder too. TENDER in the context of Law means, \"to present to PERSON, an unconditional offer, to enter into a contract\". Look at those words, then look at a bank note. THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER means, \"THIS NOTE IS AN UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW\". That is why the group name is so clever. This group is ABOUT that UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR LAW. It's ALL money.\n\nMoney is JOINDER. JOINDER MAY (Read as: \"ALWAYS DOES\") INCLUDE SURETY!\n\nTHIS is the LEGALESE you need to know. NO MORE. Your ONLY goal should be to REMOVE and/or AVOID SURETY when dealing in commerce and/or LAW. WHEN YOU SIGN A CHEQUE, you are TENDERING SURETY. A BANK NOTE does NOT THENDER SURETY as the SURETY is signed for, by SOMEBODY ELSE.\n\n-Scott Duncan","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"697920606910541","comment_count":0,"created_time":1406219471000,"message":"It is working, David Vilaca, it's just that PUBLIC TRUSTEES don't do their job, and breach the trust...."},{"id":"697922766910325","comment_count":0,"created_time":1406219992000,"message":"Your position is that YOU PAY for EVERYTHING, INCLUDING the name, and its \"rights\", and you aren't getting what you pay for."},{"id":"697922440243691","comment_count":0,"created_time":1406219921000,"message":"Their ULTIMATE goal is for us to say: IT DOSEN'T WORK, and keep on being slaves......"},{"id":"697931546909447","comment_count":0,"created_time":1406220790000,"message":"Some corpses are worth more than others.

In that post, I mentioned that he is the only man who had ever taken the time with me to actually look up the definition of a word before resuming the conversation. Well, recently, that same word came up in another conversation I was having with someone else and guess what.... I had forgotten the precise definition. One of the things we are learning here is how damn important it is to be precise. So I had to go and look up that word again. But is that it? \n\nIt was not so long ago, for me anyways, that yes, that would be it. But now, you see, I am putting some of the pieces together. I can \"see\" that my brain is actually running a program.... (thanks Scott) And I can \"see\" some of how it is working, and I can also see some of that \"filter\" in action. So in order to carry on into the next revision I wanted to make a change. \n\nI think that it is horrible that I forgot. It is small and insignificant on the surface sure, but when you dig a little deeper it really stings. Look at it this way... Here is a man whose time is very precious, and he gave me some of that time, for free, without asking anything in return... To impart something important unto me. So now, a year later, I had forgot something. I mean, if I let that pass it is like shitting on him for his efforts isn't it?\n\nSo Fuck that. I want to figure out why, these words that I thought I knew but meant something other than what I thought, seem to slip back into the wrong category again with forgetfullness. I had invested the time and energy into looking something up only to have it slip away. I have experienced this more than once now, and now that I am watching for glitches in my thinking, I see them all over the place. How many are there that I don't see (yet).\n\nSo I began a couple months ago looking into ways that computer science can help me solve this problem I am having. It is the answer to everything right? Although I have not got it totally sorted (yet) I think I am far enough along with this little experiment on myself to report back to anyone who cares to read this, what I have found.\n\nWhen investigating \"forgetting\" and learning tools, I came across a computer program that is using an algorithm to anticipate the precise point in which someone is about to forget a fact and it then brings it back up again for study/review. You can dig into the articles on their site if you want, just google supermemo and go from there.\n\nOverall, the idea is this. I determine what I want to learn and remember, and I feed that into the program. Then I trust the program to bring that back to my attention when I am about to forget it. In this way, I can be precise about what I want to keep, and what I want to let fall from my mind.\n\nHaving said that, I still think that a program like this is a crutch. Although, if I were to draw a comparison, I think of it like a guy that has been in a wheelchair for years, and now needs to walk... Let him use the crutch until he can do it on his own.\n\nI know that I was/am broken. I know now that I've been lied to all my life. I cannot unlearn what I have been shown. What I can do though is put the effort into NOT doing that to others. I see now, since being exposed to Scott/Tara and the rest of the Tender For Law group, the damage that inflicts. I do NOT want to be a raindrop that contributes to the flood.\n\nSo with more work, perhaps I will purge the rest of the crap, and retain the gold.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"901475373221729","comment_count":0,"created_time":1447159224000,"message":"We need more people thinking like this."},{"id":"1021323567903575","comment_count":0,"created_time":1467039348000,"message":"I wonder how they would manage to remove it if you've transferred the rights to it to another...."},{"id":"911233025579297","attachment":{"media":{"image":{"height":659,"src":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12346382_10205336384516095_5960521713937633769_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=f8b40773262c8ea1e8e68ff23458cb41&oe=5B6E0629","width":720}},"target":{"id":"10205336384516095","url":"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205336384516095&set=p.10205336384516095&type=3"},"type":"photo","url":"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205336384516095&set=p.10205336384516095&type=3"},"comment_count":0,"created_time":1449349967000,"message":"Oh.....a LIEN, yes yes yes, I know what that is :D"},{"id":"901572649878668","comment_count":0,"created_time":1447177163000,"message":"FFS thanks Age Thomson you just described what I go through all the time. :-)"},{"id":"911618255540774","comment_count":0,"created_time":1449438970000,"message":"OOOhhh....Pete Daoust, you're a bad bad bad bad man :P"},{"id":"911235125579087","comment_count":0,"created_time":1449350422000,"message":"If anyone would want to BUY it, every offer will be considered I've heard :D"},{"id":"911228525579747","comment_count":0,"created_time":1449348999000,"message":"The word was LIEN Pete Daoust.

So sad but true and plus it's lonely knowing the truth.. so hard to find people to relate too and/or have a real deep conversation with. They call me crazy and or he's just lucky. LUCKY my ass.. Luck nor God or prayers from people freed me from this, Only the truth did and always will...THE NOTICE OF MISTAKE.. SURETY & ACCOUNTING.. nothing else."},{"id":"1017424664960132","comment_count":0,"created_time":1466445150000,"message":"Michael A Rivera is onto something ! :D"},{"id":"1016955081673757","comment_count":0,"created_time":1466368326000,"message":"Without UNDERSTANDING they can not proceed.

PAR COURRIERTOUS DROITS R√âSERV√âS / SANS PR√âJUDICE\n\nDear Mister Marc Brochu Lawyer\n\nI have received the registered mail #LP418555324CA which YOU have sent to my PERSON.\n\nVou know very well that you have not received those bills of exchange as PAYMENT, but for a DEBT DISCHARGE. I don‚Äôt want to BUY BACK those debts, I‚Äôd rather use my person‚Äôs SURETY so that it can DISCHARGE those debts, for the simple reason that I‚Äôm sick and tired of BEING ROBBED. So, you writing that you have received those bills of exchange as PAYMENT is a LIE Mister Marc Brochu Lawyer.\n\nMoreover, you have only sent back one of the three bills of exchange, being # 15-00577-5.\n\nMoreover, you want $606.00 for that bill of exchange, which‚Äôs value is only $507.00.\n\nTake good notice, Mister the LAWYER, that by refusing those bills of exchange, you are refusing and/or ignoring and/or violating my fundamental right to my person‚Äôs SURETY and that your Bar Association will be informed of your HOSTILE intentions towards the PUBLIC.\n\nTake good notice, Mister the LAWYER, that I will keep this promise to PAY, as soon as you send back the missing 2 bills of exchange, and correct the accounting, as I do not have to pay for your incompetence, and at the moment at which you will ACCEPT that payment, it will be confirmed by YOU that you are declaring me your property and slave.\n\nTake good notice, Mister the LAWYER, that not only I am one of your victimes, but that Latraverse Huissier de Justice Inc and MALIDAN Inc then become your victims as well in this matter.\n\nAlso take notice that I am FASCINATED with your INCOMPETENCE and, unless your Bar Association confirms that you IN FACT own me and I‚Äôm your slave, I will FORMALLY demand your definitive revocation from this profession, as it is now evident that your intentions are HOSTILE towards the public.\n\nTake notice that had you well done your job, for which the puiblic is paying you, and had you sent back those bills of exchange a year ago, ME and my family, as well as Latraverse Huissier de Justice Inc, and MALIDAN Inc, would have been spared a lot of problems.\n\nBy this registered mail #LP418555324CA which you sent, you become SURETY in regards to ALL prejudices and/or violations of rights and/or criminal charges and/or claims which could be filed and/or made against you. Unless, of course, the Barreau du Qu√©bec confirms that we are all your slaves and/or property.\n\nTake notice that your TAX collector AGENTS have forcibly taken my NAME, in regards to those three debts created by YOU.\n\nTake notice that I NEVER give my NAME, that NAME being MINE, to any Government AGENT without knowing WHO will be the party holding SURETY for those debts and/or TAXES that those Agents intend to create and/or demand.\n\nI literally REFUSE that MY LIFE be ROBBED by YOU. And that‚Äôs what Her Majesty, with the advice and consent of the National Assembly of Qu√©bec, enacted withinthe Charte des Droits et Libert√©s du Qu√©bec by giving me the RIGHT to the surety of MY person. That right has precisely been enacted to prevent YOU from stealing our lives.\n\nThe question is simple, am I the man who has the right to MY person‚Äôs surety ?, or am I one of your properties and/or slaves, and do I not have the choice but to have my life STOLEN by YOU, dear Barreau du Qu√©bec.\nDear Agent Matricule 111, and Agent Matricule 116 from the Mirabel Police, I wish you take notice that you‚Äôve been victims of FRAUD, on december 17th, 2015, during the Huissier MARTIN MERCIER‚Äôs visit at my place. You have received false information from that Bailiff, saying I didn‚Äôt send anything to the Ville de Terrebonne (Bills of exchange), which is, as you can now realize, is a lie. You also know that the WHOLE scene was filmed. You have threatened me and intimidated me, on december 17th, 2015, while you were assisting a THIEF, that‚Äôs filmed.\n\nSo, as the Canadian Criminal Code clearly states at articles 337, 339, 340 et 341 in regards to those bills of exchange that this Bailiff did hid from you, take notice that you‚Äôve assisted a FRAUDSTER. I‚Äôm looking forward to see what you will do with this information. Know that I COUNT on you to PROTECT AND SERVE us, here, in this great city of Mirabel, and I PAY you for that service. Know that it would be reasonable and easy for me to CLAIM, dear Agents 111 and 116, I could go as far as register a lien on Mirabel for many $millions, just as I did against la Ville de Terrebonne, but no, I won‚Äôt, but I‚Äôd like if you could do something to right your wrong, arrest MARTIN MARCIER, because ALL must obey the LAW, and NOONE is above the LAWS. MARTIN MERCIER violated MANY of those laws, I offer you my help if you want it. MARTIN MERCIER entered my house, while I was out, and that, without my expressed or implied consent, violating articles 5, 7 et 8 of the Quebec Charter, BREAKING AND ENTERING, that‚Äôs pretty bad, isn‚Äôt it ? I have the tapes of three phone calls with M.MARTIN MERCIER HUISSIER AGENT DE LA PAIX which will prove with no reasonable doubt that he lied to you to steal from me.\n\nIf I don‚Äôt hear back from you, Matricule 111 and Matricule 116, I will understand that you don‚Äôt give a flying fuck about US, those who pay for you to PROTECT and SERVE us, and the public will be INFORMED of that.I claimed back those bills of exchange at least twenty times and PROMISED to pay if la Ville de Terrebonne refused them, I have proofs, if the Police de Mirabel don‚Äôt wanna do the job for which we pay, I will contact the Permanent Anti Corruption Unit, if the PACU doesn‚Äôt want to do the job for which we pay, I will contact the RCMP, and if the RCMP doesn‚Äôt want to do the job for which we pay, I will contact the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal if I have no other choice. Unless, of course, the Barreau du Qu√©bec confirms, by a written declaration, that we‚Äôre all their slaves and/or properties\n\nDear Reporters, I am able to show you, in DETAILS, how we are being robbed here in Quebec, I am able to show you in DETAILS how we have the POWER to REFUSE that shameful robbery which as being going on for many years here in Quebec, I am not one of those dumbass Sovereign Citizens, I want to OBEY the LAW, because ALL must obey the LAW, and NOONE is above the LAWS, and that LAW starts with the Charte des Droits et Libert√©s du Qu√©bec. You could FILM me and use everything I will say AGAINST me if you wish so, but be careful, what you will learn, you can‚Äôt unlearn.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBY : _____________________________________________\nThe man who POSSESSES the Juridical Personnality named PIERRE DAOUST with inscription #1196604112851.

It's the ultimate artificial person.  To understand what this means you should refer to my earlier articles.  The Criminal Code of Canada states, inter alia [Source R.S., c. C-34, s. 2 \"INTERPRETATION\"]:\n \n‚Äúevery one‚Äù, ‚Äúperson‚Äù and ‚Äúowner‚Äù\n¬´ quiconque ¬ª, ¬´ individu ¬ª, ¬´ personne ¬ª et ¬´ propri√©taire ¬ª\n‚Äúevery one‚Äù, ‚Äúperson‚Äù and [Ed. NOT 'or', it's 'and'.] ‚Äúowner‚Äù, and similar expressions, INCLUDE [Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius] HER MAJESTY AND [Ed. NOT 'or', it's 'and', AGAIN!] AN ORGANIZATION;\n \nBefore we cover HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION it is vital to remember why ARTIFICIAL PERSONS exist in the first place.  The sole purpose of a PERSON is to act as a LEGAL AGENT.  Remember that for later, it will become important as all PERSONS recognized LEGALLY are by their very nature AGENTS.  In THE TENDER FOR LAW, we often define LEGAL as \"it's all accounting and surety\".  Accountants set PUBLIC POLICY, and that policy determines which AGENCY pays.  There are no PERSONS involved, only AGENCY.  If you are acting as an employee for WALMART or an employee for the FBI, you are in fact an AGENT, not a PERSON.  This would mean that WALMART or the FBI would be the SURETY for that AGENCY.  This would mean WALMART and the FBI are SURETY for their AGENTS.  My article on SURETY has already been published and if you haven't read it you probably should do that now - instead of reading this.\n \n \nMany of you are learning the hard way that the LEGAL MATRIX acts on PRESUMPTION.  This is why your full name, address and date of birth are requested in all interactions with the government.  You, the \"NATURAL PERSON\" along with an ORGANIZATION (the ATTORNEY GENERAL/government), form AGENCY.  When you IDENTIFY yourself in this fashion you are accepting JOINDER, and henceforth you are HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION, just as an employee for the FBI IS the FBI.  That is what AGENCY is.\n \n \nFBI agents tend to IDENTIFY themselves as \"Special Agents\".  (I assume they make this declaration for the same reasons the Special Olympics do; it's like the regular Olympics...only they're retards.  On that note, if an FBI agent ever calls you a \"Conspiracy Theorist\", remind them that coming from the people who brought us ABSCAM, that's pretty ironic.  Look up ABSCAM - you'll get the joke).\n \n \nI've really tried to \"dumb down\" AGENCY as much as I could.  An AGENT is a slave that represents the MASTER.  The master is always SURETY.  When you accept JOINDER by IDENTIFYING yourself with your first name, last name, address, and date of birth, you become HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION.  You are now SURETY, and you must follow the rules of the organization.  Otherwise, you have committed an OFFENCE.  \n \n \nMany of you are \"offended\" by what I say, especially piece-of-shit Christians (see what I did there?).  When they cry about how offended they are, they seem to think that this \"offence\" give them some higher \"victim\" status.  Here in reality the declaration, \"I'm offended!\" is simply whining.  Now let's shift over to a different JURISDICTION.  If you are on an AQUILAE vessel, and I'm \"offended\", that could be fatal.  It's a different JURISDICTION, and as of this writing I am the highest authority in that jurisdiction.  This means if I'm offended, you're likely going overboard.  You already consented to those rules when you found yourself on board one of my vessels.  If you're dragged onto one of my vessels against your will, you're definitely going to die anyway, and if you're given any hope of survival it's very likely someone's just fucking with you.  ;)\n \nTry not to miss the point here!  If \"offence\" is legislated, and you identify yourself as HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION, being an AGENT thereof, you are subject to all the rules.\n \n \nLook at the Criminal Code.  Notice it doesn't say the \"Criminal Law\".  It says CODE.  You will see that it refers to \"A general collection of laws\".  When someone refers to a \"secret code\" they are referring to a \"secret collection of laws\".  Codes usually refer to specific subject matter such as Criminal Code, Code of Ethics, Probate Code, Penal Code.  These things all apply to HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION.\n \n \nIn the UNITED STATES you are acting as AGENT for the current TRUSTEE.  At this writing it's \"Homeland Security\".  If you look at a passport stamp from the United States, you will notice that the stamp says, \"Homeland Security\", and not \"UNITED STATES\".  The TRUSTEE has AUTHORITY to grant or refuse entry into the JURISDCTION, while that JURISDICTION is in RECEIVERSHIP.  Since the UNITED STATES is running trillion dollar deficits, with absolutely no consequence, you very quickly realize that the UNITED STATES is in receivership (and has been since 1933).  Within a generation, the United States went from \"Republic\" to \"Nation of Trustees\" - and nobody noticed.  Research Woodrow Wilson and \"The New Deal\" with the knowledge you've gained from THE TENDER FOR LAW, and you will see the crime that has been visited upon you.\n \n \nI fear with the apathy and ignorance of Commonwealth Subjects, the same fate soon awaits us in CANADA.  UNITED STATES citizens have failed to notice that their country no longer produces anything except POLICY; policy set by accountants.  These particular accountants are not working in your interest.  They don't care about PERSONS, they don't care about individuals.  They care about balancing the books, accounts and agency; in that order.  \n \n \nNow let's cover your \"ARTIFICIAL PERSON\".  In earlier articles we covered the fact that your birth certificate is a security.  It is also a bond, which affords you certain RIGHTS and PRIVILEGES.  Chief amoungst those is your right to ACT as AGENT for HER MAJESTY AND AN ORGANIZATION.  While we're on the subject of the birth certificate, a very disturbing trend is happening, and no one is noticing.  Until recently all birth certificates had TWO SIGNATURES on them.  This afforded you the AUTHORITY to sign as AGENT.  Three signatures = BINDING LEGAL TRUST.  Now I'm seeing examples of birth certificates that have only ONE SIGNATURE, so I sent my blood hounds after some answers, and what they returned was very interesting.  \n \n \nSomewhere on these new pseudo-certificates with one signature, there is universally a DECLARATION, usually at the bottom.  It DECLARES that it is a \"FOUNDATION DOCUMENT\".  It really is that simple.  Use of the birth certificate is acceptance of that fact, just as use of a $10 bill is acceptance of a TENDER FOR LAW.  In this case the law in question is SURETY AND ACCOUNTING, and all the \"codes\" attached.\n \n \nNow that we have a basic understanding of an \"artificial person\", and we have established the global truths about all artificial persons, we can cover specific artificial persons.  \n \n \nIn order to \"act\" LEGALLY, an artificial person is created.  When you are issued a traffic ticket, you do not write your name down, an AGENT does.  That agent, in this case a \"Policy Enforcer\" is TESTIFYING as to how you identified yourself.  The identification you provide happens to contain your full name, address and date of birth.  The only way you could have obtained this licence is either through a birth certificate, citizenship card, or valid passport.  All three of these are revenue streams to Policy Enforcers.  I'm hesitant to publish anything regarding \"driving\" vs. \"travelling\", because I don't want to give the FREE-DUMBERS ammunition.  If you want to travel without a licence, use public or commercial transport, a livery service, or a horse and buggy.  All three options require that somebody pays insurance - the third option is something you must pay.  Paying an insurance POLICY is paying an artificial person to accept SURETY under certain conditions (codes).  Here's where the FREE-DUMBER argument falls down regarding travel and property.\n \n \nYou will hear these arguments from one of two sources.  The first being natives and/or \"aboriginals\"; when they explain the law regarding travel and property, they are telling the truth.  They have LEGAL STANDING to make this declaration, because it says so in countless TREATIES.  When Robert Menard and Dean Clifford make this CLAIM they are simply lying through ommission; because if you are one of the invaders, which you are if you're not native, you benefit from ongoing commercial warfare.  Like it or not, if you are going to share the road with your fellow humans, the issue of SURETY is going to come up, especially if there's an accident.  A deadbeat like Robert Menard is never going to be able to support the needs and medical bills of someone he may have crippled while drunk driving one night.  Here in reality his \"100% responsible declaration\" is bullshit by any LEGAL standard, and no-fault insurance only applies when both parties are insured.  Even a horse and buggy needs a bare minimum of $1,000,000 liability insurance.  I know this because I was once the owner of a horse, and a buggy.\n \n \nIf you haven't read \"Insurance for the Inept\" (appointed by Gail Blackman), you should stop and read it now.  \n \n \nSince 1982 I have run a private navy.  The trust that holds that navy, also has its own currency.  In 2010, the AQUILAE cryptic currency was commissioned, and the need for FIAT currency disappeared, except as regards insurance.\n \n \nWhen you accept that the term \"LEGAL\" is all SURETY and ACCOUNTING, you quickly realize that everything LEGAL has a monetary value.  There are no exceptions to this rule.  Let me repeat that so your empty head will absorb it.  All things legal have a monetary value attached, including SURETY.  The FREE-DUMBER says he can drive without a licence, and he is telling the truth.  The lie of ommision is that you cannot get insurance without a driver's licence.  In Common Law Jurisdictions LEGAL ACTS and STATUTES do not acknowlege your RIGHT to property; whereas in Civil Law Jurisdiction, the RIGHT to property is absolute.  The LEGAL consequences of Robert Menard getting drunk and injuring somebody whilst \"travelling with his property\" will not be accepted by any other party; and the \"wake up and be a FREE-DUMBER\" line doesn't really work when it comes to medical expenses and basic needs.  Some highways are semi-private, and if a FREE-DUMBER drives down those they can expect to have a SWAT team arrest them and seize their \"property\".  This has happened on the 407 ETR more than once.  Like everything else in LAW, FREE-DUMBERS lie through ommission.  It is very easy to produce case law showing the courts acknowledge that use of the roads is in fact, a RIGHT, not a privilege.  There are even high-risk insurance companies that will insure a vehicle without a driver's licence, but the premiums will be $30,000 a year.  \n \n \nBack to \"ARTIFICIAL PERSONS\".  In my first article regarding PERSONS, we covered the fact that NATURAL PERSON = \"Picking up the Tab\".  Accepting and/or identifying yourself as an \"INDIVIDUAL\" means you are deemed to be a NATURAL PERSON.  If you identify yourself as an INDIVIDUAL you are ACCEPTING SURETY by default.  Since you're picking up the tab, the government AGENT, attempting to impose commerce on you, will of course order the most expensive items on the menu.  The courts recognize the government as a PRIVATE PERSON.  If you are in court against your will you might find it useful to demand proof that the government has STANDING as a PRIVATE PERSON.  This also applies in the UNITED STATES.  If the court refuses to provide proof, INFORM the court that you intend to offer as PROOF FOR APPEAL an objection to this presumption of \"PERSONHOOD\" that the court has arbitrarily granted the government, and a demand for $1,000,000 SECURITY FOR COSTS.  In Western Society, SECURITY FOR COSTS is a well-documented RIGHT.  You are basically demanding insurance.  Since it was offered as PROOF FOR APPEAL, and presuming the Appelate Court is following the rules, it virtually guarantees the case will be thrown out on appeal, for exactly the same reasons the government seizes Dean Clifford's property; if it interacts with, and affects others, and it is not insured, it is the government's mandate to remove it from the PUBLIC domain.  If there was nobody on the road except you, it would be ok to drive without insurance.  But there is...so it isn't.  \n \n \nI too can travel the highways without a licence or insurance, because it turns out there are lots and lots of people who will happily drive you anywhere you want to go in exchange for worthless FIAT currency.  Some of them are even good at it.  One of my captains used to make a \"hobby\" out of collecting drivers's licences, and had the bragging rights of claiming he's one of the few people in ONTARIO that has an AZBM licence.  This means if it travels on the road, no matter what it is, he can LEGALLY drive it.  The \"B\" designation is apparently the hardest, because it required learning to drive a school bus.  Apparently the test is rigid but he \"aced it\" because in reality he was just driving a big yellow truck designed to carry children without seat belts.  From a transport perspective children really aren't that heavy a payload.  \n \n \n...I digress.\n \n \nWhen the courts were still following the rules, I always got a big kick out of the fact that you can sell SURETY ahead of time; and the government is compelled to buy it.  If a JUSTICE grants SECURITY FOR COSTS the ATTORNEY GENERAL had better have the budget to cover it, or the case does not move forward.  One PARTY is attempting to affect another, without insurance, just like when a FREE-DUMBER drives without insurance.  \n \n \nMany of you still cannot grasp cryptographic currency from a practical standpoint, yet none of you seem to have any trouble grasping the concept of CANADIAN TIRE money.  CANADIAN TIRE money is issued as coupons that ACT as an internal currency.  In many accounting circles this is often referred to as \"brown currency\", as it is always circulating internally.  Think of the concept of cryptographic currency as you would your own CORPORATION'S version of CANADIAN TIRE money.  Large purchases can be made with CANADIAN TIRE money, but it cannot be exchanged for cash.  However, you are free to exchange CANADIAN TIRE money for any purchase you agree to.  Bars, during charity events, often accept CANADIAN TIRE money at par.  This has the benefit of not being taxable, allowing the business to write-off the consumables as a CAPTIAL LOSS and/or INVESTED CAPITAL depending on the product and/or service being purchased.  Keeping this in mind will remove any confusion you may have regarding creating your own bank/currency.  \n \n \nIf you have accepted THE TENDER FOR LAW which FIAT currency provides, you will accept that the LEGAL MATRIX will deem it fact that the FIAT currency in question is good for \"all debts public and private\".  This is another \"lie of ommission\" that Robert Menard attempted to pipe out in his latest video about me.  If you do not accept the currency in the creation of a debt, then that law doesn't really apply.  I will do absolutely nothing in commerce, especially for government, in exchange for FIAT currency.  I simply do not accept the creation of that debt and/or contract as I have as a matter of PUBIC RECORD RESIGNED from government service.  The INDIVIDUAL and all its titles are LEGALLY CLAIMED under the AQUILAE TRUST.  This means that if the government wishes to impose commerce on me, they must pay that debt first.  They can pay me in LEGAL TENDER, but that's a quarter of a billion dollars; and if I'm given a quarter of a billion dollars worth of economic power over night, 100% of that worthless currency will be used to collapse the banking system and start a war.  Let that serve as a warning to anyone who happens to be seriously considering giving us large amounts of money.  \n \n \nI will work like a slave for any contract that pays me in AQUILAE currency.  AQUILAE currency is valuable money, and the TENDER FOR LAW attached to it, is whatever I say it is.  Why?  Because \"fuck off that's why\"...it's MY currency!  If you don't like it, go shop somewhere else.  Besides, the FREE-DUMBERS say I'm mean.  In their heads, \"nice but inept\" is far better than the truth.  Apparently truth = mean.  As actual legal knowledge starts bleeding out from THE TENDER FOR LAW, and the people from the \"first wave\" are starting to teach others, the revenue streams of the FREE-DUMBER gurus are in serious jeopardy.  Robert Menard and his now notorious \"Scott Duncan is wrong\" Youtube Video, shows the desperation, because now the victims of the FREE-DUMBERS don't have to suck-up the FREE-DUMB excuses like, \"You just payed for my time\", and other bullshit platitudes to deflect SURETY.  Now they have a weapon that hurts.  That weapon is the declaration \"Scott was right again\".  That will cause the victims to come seeking real answers from a MEGA-PERSON...and that's the last kind of PERSON we're going to discuss. Menard can lie about what words mean, and beg for FIAT, while those that listen and understand what I'm desperately trying to hammer into your stultified brains, will the first of the pioneers. The Pioneers PROFIT, and the NEW economy will be YOURS TO COMMAND, but if you fuck it up, you will destroy yourself, just like Menard, only with less alcohol. :D\n \n \nWe'll call it a pseudo-LEGAL term to make the courts happy; and over the next year it's going to make the courts beg for the \"good old days\" of the FREE-DUMBERS.  MEGA-PERSON will be the only real PARTY in Open-Source government.  As you read this now, this sounds as incredible as making your own currency and bank, and learning to administer your affairs so you profit.  The base framework has been layed out over the past 18 months.  Some of you have casually studied, some of you were compelled to study through external forces, and a precious few of you dedicated every last free minute of time to study.  Those precious few of you who fall into that category are the first to scratch their heads when people describe me as \"mean\".  You can call any of the AQUILAE officers or crew 24-hours a day, and all of them are mandated to have the utmost patience and to stay on the phone as long as they're needed - and that's just the \"overflow\" policy.  I personally handle the bulk of the calls.  It's those precious few people that actually keep me going.  When you understand what a PERSON is LEGALLY, and you UNDERSTAND what SURETY is, and who has it, all your concerns about money should just vanish.  It is July 2014.  It is my least profitable year ever.  It has pushed the entire navy and every officer into personal debt, but we maintain the course because we know we have the answer to everything.  We have computer science.  Computer Science is going to replace government.  Observe the wild ride of BITCOIN over the long term and you can observe computer science affecting reality.  The block chain always maintains its regulated growth.  Banks have tried collective pump-and-dump scams; and it immediately returned to its original growth value.  When you look at BITCOIN over its entire existence, the \"unstable\" nature of cryptographic currencies becomes a lot less clear.  There is a measurable straight line.  It's math; and 2 + 2 always equals 4.  It doesn't matter what you believe.\n \n \nOver the next few weeks I will be introducing the component parts of the \"MEGA-PERSON\".  This LEGAL monster will be yours to control.  It's intent is hostile, and its purpose is to destroy millions of dollars in minutes (if it has to).  This will implement governmental change.  A MEGA-PERSON will have the economic power to destroy currency, because I intend to port government and law into the realm of computer science, just as currency already has.  A \"dress rehersal\" is playing out today.  Two competing currencies - one is debt and joinder, sold as \"value\", the other is value with no debt attached, and temporarily no TENDER FOR LAW either.  Etherium is going to change that.  Etherium is THE TENDER FOR LAW attached to a cryptographic currency; and you have an unambiguous way to write the law.  It then becomes evolution through natural selection.  If you write \"bad law\" you have \"bad currency\", and the market will automatically reflect that.  This will plant the first seeds of \"Open Source Government\".  Policy Enforcers will be tasked with the integrity of POLICIES and the rules set out in real time by the people.  You can repurpose these dumb thugs to follow orders enforcing laws that are generated in real time, and the dumb thug in question will be able to verify its authenticity instantly, and to deflect all SURETY for his actions.  The law is written for Etherium, and once implemented, becomes verifiable at each step in any transaction.  The fact the currency is being exchanged means there are two agreeable PARTIES with the computerized government/bank as the TRUSTEE.  We will then make the system compatible with all cultures.  You could write Sharia law into an Etherium contract, and computer science will determine if it's compliant.  Mullas will absolutely love that they can produce mathematical proof that his \"flock\" are \"good Muslims\".  Open Source law has to work for everyone; even those whose cultures and ideologies I personally loathe.  Otherwise it's just more tyranny deployed from someone of noble birth.  If you think things are getting \"hairy\" with competing currencies, wait until a herd of MEGA-PERSONS form a competing government.  \n \n \nAll of this has already started.  Think of me as the anti-Christ of all PERSONS.  Little niche services are already paying participants for their contribution.  Name Coin is a good example. This is a robustly trading currency that pays you for providing DNS services.  Each query that hits your contributing piece of hardware, whether it's your phone, your iPAD or your desktop computer, will pay you in Name Coin.  The payment comes with the query.  The transaction is instantaneous, meaning your phone or your computer pays you for essentially being \"turned on\".  As connectivity becomes more and more standardized, off-the-shelf phones, tablets, laptops and computers can suddenly be a device that pays you instead of costing you.  Staying in the realm of cryptographic currencies, a lot of money can be made by running a currency exchange.  To avoid legal entanglements it is vital that no cryptographic currency that passes into your PERSON's custody ever be converted to FIAT currency.  Accepting the currency is accepting the terms.  The terms are \"LEGAL\", and it has been \"TENDERed\" with PROPER NOTICE.  The JURISDICTION therefore is \"LEGAL\"; and ACCEPTING this currency ACCEPTS THE TENDER FOR LAW attached.  Yes that even applies to MEGA-PERSON; and as we construct MEGA-PERSON you will learn why that LEGAL BINDING alone turns MEGA-PERSON into a dreadful LEGAL weapon.\n \n \nSo let this article serve as PROPER NOTICE that we are constructing MEGA-PERSON; since its mandate is by its very nature hostile and destructive to any and all PERSONS, PRIVATE and/or PUBLIC, who participate in FRAUD OF ANY KIND.  This includes banks and government.  If the government can make slave PERSONS, so can you.  \n \n \nI'm building an Empire of Math, and I don't care if you CONSENT, because reality doesn't care either.  Lead, follow, or get out of the way.  Those are your RIGHTS under Open Source Government until it's deployed.  The law will quite literally be written by the people.  The Common Law will be integrated as much as possible, but more importantly the first wave will only exist to make it easy for the second wave.  Just like in THE TENDER FOR LAW, only on a global scale.  At the moment it sounds ridiculous, but I remind you that two years ago all of you thought that having your own bank/currency was ridiculous too.  I know many of you have actually been affected by my writing/teachings at a very (dare I say?) PERSONAL level.  And to those who feel that way, know that you are the \"first wave\".  You will teach those that follow.  This is a time of war, hence my Churchill-like demeanor, but notice Churchill was immediately booted from office once the war was over.  The same fate awaits me.  The power I'm building for everyone cannot be in my control after all of us have won.  As my beloved Tara has publicly announced that she seeks world domination, one of the first mandates of Open Source Government is to make sure that woman NEVER has control.  Just trust me on this people - of the two of us, I'M the NICE one.\n \n \nAnyway...over the next year, we shall be putting these pieces together.  We are all going to draft law in controlled environments (for this we will use Etherium Alpha).  We are going to leverage open standards for profit (like binding a Facebook account to its own currency), and we are going to put all these pieces together into something you can immediately use for your own personal gain and profit.  This entire process is designed to excessively reward the \"pioneers\".  This is a double-edged sword.  If you attempt to profit off of others, with no consideration (like current banks/government), the market automatically crashes your currency.  Core laws and principles will be determined through universal consensus.  Assembling legal contracts will become as simple as assembling Lego blocks, with the contracts and/or undertakings being as simple, or as complex, as the parties agree upon.  \n \n \nI end this article with a thought that I wish you to ponder.  If all PERSONS have a monetary value attached to them, along with undertakings to various degrees, and like myself you have liened the LEGAL PERSON as PROOF of RESIGNATION from Government Service, and you have affixed a monetary value to that name, and it is now a fact under LAW until you (the Supreme Authority) say otherwise, you can take that value and LEGALLY UNDERWRITE (insure) your own PERSONAL currency.\n \n \n...and that's coming up this year.  I'm going to teach you what the FREE-DUMBERS couldn't...how to monetize your PERSON.  As with everything else I teach, I do not charge money.  Ever!  All you have to do is (NOTE: I'm only writing this to make the FREE-DUMBERS sqwak and cackle), SHUT THE FUCK UP AND DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD.\n \n \nNOTE: You really DO HAVE TO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD!  The price of admission is the acknowledgement and acceptance that all of my AXIOMS are TRUE, and the very first AXIOM is YOU THINK WRONG AND VALUE THE WRONG THINGS.  Over the past 18 months I've shown you why that's true, and how it came to be.  Now we're going to do something about it.  When I'm done everyone will think right, and will value the right things, and if they don't a computer will make them.  Imagine making law that says you specifically must be left alone, and your government enforces it.  Imagine if everybody thinks right, and values the right things.  Natural Law will become written law, all on an exponential curve to evolve our species.  To evolve our societies, and above all, to evolve each and every PERSON.\n\n-Scott Duncan","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"740121172690484","comment_count":0,"created_time":1414683333000,"message":"You are NOT the person.

Application to slaves (1640s) is a rhetorical figure of abolitionists, etc.\n\nhttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chattel\n\ncattle (n.)\nmid-13c., \"property,\" from Anglo-French catel \"property\" (Old North French catel, Old French chatel), from Medieval Latin capitale \"property, stock,\" noun use of neuter of Latin adjective capitalis \"principal, chief\" (see capital (n.1)). Compare sense development of fee, pecuniary. Sense originally was of movable property, especially livestock; it began to be limited to \"cows and bulls\" from late 16c.\n\nhttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cattle&allowed_in_frame=0\n\ncapital (adj.)\nearly 13c., \"of or pertaining to the head,\" from Old French capital, from Latin capitalis \"of the head,\" hence \"capital, chief, first,\" from caput (genitive capitis) \"head\" (see capitulum). Meaning \"main, principal, chief, dominant, most important\" is from early 15c. in English. Capital letter for an upper case one is attested from late 14c. The modern informal sense of \"excellent, first-rate\" is dated from 1762 in OED (as an exclamation of approval, OED's first example is 1875), perhaps from earlier use of the word in reference to ships, \"first-rate, of the line,\" attested from 1650s. \n\nA capital crime (1520s) is one that affects the life or \"head;\" capital had a sense of \"deadly, mortal\" from late 14c. in English, a sense also found in Latin. The felt connection between \"head\" and \"life, mortality\" also existed in Old English: as in heafodgilt \"deadly sin, capital offense,\" heafdes √æolian \"to forfeit life.\" Capital punishment was in Blackstone (1765) and classical Latin capitis poena.

The situation calls for a very easy fix, not more people fucking around.  Here is my fix.  1.  The Bank of Canada now prints all of Canada's currency, interest free.  The IMF and the BIS can go fuck a hat.  2.  All corporations are granted a 1 year renewable charter based on strict terms and conditions such as treating employees fairly, doing no damage to the environment, and producing something of value to surrounding communities.  3.  All military is called back immediately.  Their new role is training volunteer militia  groups, which would be armed by the military on completion of training.  People of sound mind and body could volunteer to participate and would be given military grade weapons to keep at home on successful completion of training.  The airforce would fly proper patrols and train civilian pilots in recon.  4.  All Canadian resources would be mandated by law to be at least 51% owned by the people of Canada.  Royalties would go up to an appropriate level, and subsidies would end for all corporations.  5.  A national free energy program would be implemented to encourage and protect those people coming forward with clean renewable energy.  Oil and gas would be phased out as quickly as possible.  6.  All nonsensical laws would be stricken from the books.  Cultivation of hemp and related plants would be encouraged.  All plant based \"drugs\" would be decriminalized.  7.  All natural cures for disease would be explored, promoted, and used.  Dangerous 'big pharma' drugs would be phased out.  8.  The education system would get a complete overhaul, and would be switched over to the modernized Trivium and Quadrivium systems.  Logic and reason would be promoted, fallacies discouraged.  Public schools would not be mandatory, but they would be excellent.  9.  The healthcare system would be completely overhauled to actually treat and cure people, starting with diet and plant based and frequency based medicine.  10.  Income tax would be phased out all together.  Corporate tax would be a flat tax based on profits.  11.  The justice system would be completely overhauled.  Statues would be gone.  Any lawyers or Justices that had acted in collusion against the people in the past would not be able to practice ever again.  Natural law and contract law would remain, do no harm would be the standard.  No one would be forced to participate unless they caused harm and would not step up on their own."},{"id":"762073123828622","comment_count":0,"created_time":1418923605000,"message":"Oh yeah, and chem trails would be illegal overnight.

In the beginning I BELIEVED that by just \"feeling thankful,\" or \"giving thanks\" to Scott, I was actually \"doing something good.\" \n\nLater (3 years after being part of this group), I started to actually think with the new information I had acquired here. It was then I realized how evil, and insulting a \"thank you\" really is. It's part of the program given to us, and it's fed by social discourse, and our own delusions. \n\n\"Thank you\" is a way of \"feeling\" that, by just saying nice magical words, you have actually repaid a debt for something someone else did for you, or gave you. And guess were that program comes from on this part of the hemisphere? The Bible! The whole \"giving thanks\" part of the Bible now will probably be seen differently by a few. \"Thank you\" turns you into an ungrateful piece of shit. It also infuses a sense of false entitlement. \n\nLook/observe at nature. A tree gets it's nutrients from the soil. The tree grows leaves, flowers, and fruit that then fall into the ground. Animals, and insects eat some of that organic material, then poop. Then all this organic material mixes and decomposes, turning into nutrients that return to the soil, that trees get again. It's a give, take, and give back constantly. And the cycle goes on.\n\nWhat would happen if the tree just gets the nutrients from the soil, but then decides to not return any leaves, flowers, or fruit back to it? What if the tree just says to the soil \"Thank you! \"God\" bless you, and may \"god\" repay you for all the nutrients!\" It would disturb nature. It would stop the flow. In the end, it's bad for everyone.\n\nBut I digress... Once I realized this, I started thinking that I could only repay a debt by actually doing something to repay it, not just feel entitled, and throw the old \"thank you/fuck you.\" \n\nIt turns out that reading a thread, Scott mentions exactly how to repay the debt owed to him. As we all know, it wasn't money that he was/is asking for. We have NOTHING of value to give him.  But he did mentioned that if you wanted to \"show your thanks,\" the way was/is to ask government officials, and Law Society, specific questions, sending notices via registered mail. And should they not answer, make it public by publishing those notices in the Legal Notices Section of the local newspaper. \n\nFor example, \"Can I use the SECURITY of my PERSON to DISCHARGE PUBLIC DEBTS?\" Or, you may ask the Law Society \"What does an attorney ATTORNS?\"\n\nShort, and simple. Don't give them 20 fucking questions. Stick to ONE question, and have them answer it in writing, via registered mail only. Do not accept any other type of correspondence, as it will probably lead to JOINDER, and you may deem this as unacceptable. \n\nThere are many readers, all at different levels of understanding. Some have been here long, some have a couple of years, and some are new. If you do not understand what you are doing, why you are doing it, and how to do it, it means you need to read more, in order to do anything. Do not be an idiot, and start doing shit if you do not know. It is really not complicated, but I make the warning for the happy trigger \"I want to look cool\" morons out there, that start sending crap without having a fucking clue of what they are doing. Oh yes, I KNOW you are out there reading!\n\nAll of Scott's articles come to mind. PROPER NOTICE FOR IDIOTS is one of them. How to write a notice, for idiots, literally. And Pete Daoust has also examples of simple, and short communications asking questions like \"Can I use the SECURITY of my PERSON to DISCHARGE PUBLIC DEBTS?\" Check him out for a \"dumbed-down\" lay down.\n\nI want to make the note that it's human, and shows empathy, to be appreciative of others. But we must demonstrate our gratitude by repaying the debt, instead of believing a \"thank you\" will do.\n\nAt the end, asking these questions will only help you, not Scott. Asking these questions should make you think. Why is it that you are asking them? That may lead you to a quest for the TRUTH. Spoiler alert: there is codified SLAVERY in place! \n\nSo there you go. You want to \"thank Scott\" or show your gratitude? Now you know what \"thanks\" means, and what to actually do to show your gratitude.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"1015710838464848","comment_count":0,"created_time":1466181267000,"message":"Cash up front, or pay with your cunt! :D\n\nThat's the official Rogue Support Tagline! :D"},{"id":"1015704131798852","comment_count":0,"created_time":1466180111000,"message":"Weed n hookers...

I look around. I see the back of Pete‚Äôs Head.... i‚Äôm at the right place! :)  So i sit down!  Then the judge arrives seconds later, i must stand up, like the others (i guess!?!). My first time in more than 20 years in that kind of places, i don‚Äôt really remember the last time and i don‚Äôt want to make any troubles so i do as they do.... i feel like i‚Äôm at the church when i was a young child..... sit down, get up, sit down.... on your knees, sing a song!!!  :/\nThey are calling the cases by numbers... Pete‚Äôs case is one of the lasts ones. They (The judge, The lawyer and Pete) talked a little bit about an affidavit from Ville de Terrebonne that came on the late and the judge send them outside to talk in some ‚Äò‚Äôprivate room‚Äô‚Äô and try to set the case. I follow Pete and his friends. They got close to a room that seems to fit them so i sit close to it. Pete and the lawyer get in the room but there‚Äôs some trouble as they enter the room; Pete‚Äôs witnesses can‚Äôt enter the room! I see some ‚Äò‚Äôfighting‚Äô‚Äô to close the door from the inside and open it from the outside! Finally Pete and the lawyer exit the room and i hear the lawyer saying: ‚Äò‚ÄôThere's nothing i can do if you don‚Äôt want to talk‚Äô‚Äô And Pete answering something like: ‚Äò‚ÄôI WANT to talk to you. We‚Äôll do it right here (in public) if my witnesses can‚Äôt enter the room, i have no problem with that.‚Äô‚Äô Finally they all (but me) enter the room; Pete, the lawyer and two other dudes. Few minutes later the lawyer get out of the ‚Äò‚Äôprivate room‚Äô‚Äô mumbling something i can‚Äôt hear but he look pissed and he‚Äôs kind of reddish!! Pete and the 2 other dude get out as well and they all get back to the court room... i follow them! \nSecond round. Pretty much all the cases are being set easily. All‚Äôs seems to get going very well... then come Pete‚Äôs turn! They are saying that the little chat in the ‚Äò‚Äôprivate room‚Äô‚Äô didn‚Äôt had any beneficial effect to set the case. Pete wants the original BoE, the lawyer don‚Äôt have them. Reason: they digitized them so they didn‚Äôt kept the originals!\nThere‚Äôs 2 cases that needs some special attention from the judge, Pete‚Äôs is one of them. He‚Äôs going last when there‚Äôs nobody else left in the room besides me, the 2 other dudes that get inside the ‚Äò‚Äôprivate room‚Äô‚Äô with Pete earlier and a girl!?! Oh wait, there‚Äôs also a peace officer that appeared as soon as Pete went to front of the room to speak with the judge. This peace officer at first stayed in the back of the room, observed everyone in the room and took notes then he move a little foward to sit down. I stayed in the back; i‚Äôm the officer‚Äôs dead angle. During all the meeting, this officer paid a special attention to the 2 dudes that were with Pete sitting in the front of the room. When one of them looked at his phone during the argumentation, he went very suspicious, looking like he was about to jump on him!\nThe argumentation tomorrow.... there's some crazy stuf in there, i really liked when the lawyer refers to the SURETY of the PERSON as it was the SECURITY OF HIS RIGHTS(!?!?!)  ...but i need to sleep now!!","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"1017213211647944","comment_count":0,"created_time":1466412039000,"message":"It's a court.

As a result, the three years of work that this group represents, is now going to be wasted.\n\nHe decided to \"scare them\" with \"Scott Duncan says HI\". I warned you people about this. This FRIGHTENS THEM. You say it after you have won. \"Scott Duncan says Hi\" is NOT something you fucking open with!\n\nWell David-Paul Sip attended a hearing WITHOUT COUNSEL (Agency) and ANSWERED QUESTIONS!\n\nThe question was \"Are you trying to influence this court\"?\n\nHe answered \"That was not my INTENT\".\n\n1: The ONLY reason you go to court, is to INFLUENCE it.\n\n2: NEVER EVER EVER EVER DECLARE INTENT IN COURT! EVER!\n\nHe didn't even answer \"no\", which is STILL A LIE. Yes you ARE trying to influence the court. It's WHY YOU ARE THERE!\n\nAs if that's not bad enough, lying and declaring INTENT means you don't even get to rebut their response.\n\nNow David-Paul Sip has attached MY name to his idiocy, and will be \"made an example of\" because they have him LYING ON THE RECORD...and then BACKING IT UP BY DECLARING HIS INTENT! If you don't INTEND to INFLUENCE the court, then you INTEND TO HARM IT. The court can now claim status of INJURED PARTY. The INJURY MAKES THEM A PARTY! \n\nWhat is the LEGAL definition of \"influence\"? Spoiler: It means to enhance or benefit. LOOK IT UP!\n\nHe couldn't have answered with \"I'm not authorized to answer questions\" or even \"I don't feel comfortable answering without counsel\" (who is now off the hook, surety-wise)! No, he had to appear \"clever\" and \"smart\" by using \"smart people words\" like \"that was not my intent.\n\nThe burden is on the opposing party to prove INTENT. NEVER MENTION INTENT IN COURT! EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe credibility of THE TENDER FOR LAW as a source of what is true, is now tainted, because some idiot wanted to \"look cool\", and attach MY NAME TO IT.\n\n...and so they will \"make an example\" of him. Other parties will declare \"That's what happens when you listen to Scott Duncan\".\n\nLike Gail Marie, David-Paul Sip will stop publicly declaring that I am not in any way responsible for their ignorance/stupidity, and eventually tell tales of how he was \"blinded\" by what I was saying, just like Gail Marie does.\n\nThe Quatlosers will call him another \"victim\" of what I teach here, all because he wanted to appear \"smart\" in front of strangers.\n\nI can fight off the Gail Marie crap, but not TWO examples. I'm tired of having my name attached to YOUR STUPIDITY. Now it will be used to discredit the whole group.\n\nDavid-Paul Sip will be another Gail Marie. I don't want to play anymore.\n\nPete Daoust was the only one to really get the point of all this.\n\nAll of this reminds me what lying duplicitous pieces of shit you all are.\n\nI'm done.\n\nWe will be making a backup of the group, and then we are packing it all in.\n\nI kept my promise. I should have done this in January. Instead I got inspired by those in Quebec, and stuck around.\n\nI KNEW I shouldn't have.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"1013634185339180","comment_count":0,"created_time":1465852569000,"message":"I'll find you guys on better parts of the Internet.

But now, taking breaks and then coming back, I find things are starting to stand out.  \n\nI've been getting frustrated lately because there are some posts where ideas are started, but not finished in the posts or there are multiple directions that are not quite clear to me.  \n\nI would much rather ask for clarification in the posts, than to message any of the members, as I know you all get bombarded with questions in your inboxes.\n\nagain... thank you for allowing me to join."},{"id":"981495581886374","comment_count":0,"created_time":1460834752000,"message":"\"had a my charges vacated once\"\n\nCan you vague that up?

Hell, Scott even made another Facebook group about it!  Computer Science.\nBut what is computer science really? \n\nIf you look around, you will find a ton of answers to that I am sure (because I looked too). In a simple term that a little kid could get, computer science is basically algorithms, the study of and the application of. This is why we can have a 2000 year old computer, well before electricity. It's simply input/output, on/off, true/false, 1/0.\n\nWhat then is an algorithm right? Ok, basic little kid terms again, it is the program, the math, the logic that goes into solving the problem. In other words, it's the recipe you use to make the cake the same every time, it's the calculation you use to determine the outcome. If this, then that...\n\nAn algorithm itself can be a work of art. I wish I knew this when I was young, imagine the beauty I have missed all these years. At least I can see now though. (Thaanks Scott)\n\nYou've heard Scott say many times that he knows that this (xyz event) will happen in the future sometime, then it does. Is he a magician? Nope, he is not. But he will also clearly tell you he's \"Done the math\"... That is the power of computer science. Look at your problem, design the algorithm, do the math, know the future.\n\nYou will also notice that Scott is not \"claiming\" this or that, he is stating that it IS... Look at the words. \n\nHow is it that he's always right, and you cannot find the example of him being wrong? Duh, computer science man!\n\nStop looking for bullshit, stop catering to other people's bullshit. Focus on what matters! The computer science. It's true or it's not. \n\nIn the above, example, I only pushed through in reading the whole thing because Scott asked. My bullshit detector goes off a lot quicker after learning from Scott (it barely ever went off before)\n\nSo in breaking it down. \nScott Duncan is always right is not a logical fallacy if it is demonstratably true. There is over 3 years here in this group worth of evidence. When you systematically remove all of the other possibilities, whatever remains must me the truth. Even if it seems on the surface to be preposterous.\n\nNo Scientist or man of reason would make this claim... (it is not a claim, it IS <---- see what I  did there.... 2+2=4 because it is demonstratably true.... He is not claiming, he is stating the truth, and it is demonstratably so) ..... then we go on to a logical fallacy of his own when we introduce a child molesting pope.\nNow the part where we all must be \"believers\" ... If anyone has been reading this group you would certainly know what Scott has to say about \"belief\"... All actual thinking stops when belief is around. So clearly he is lying here. Then he touches on \"Scottisms\" (I want to review that scottisms thread now that he has mentioned it. It was a beautiful thread that one....\n\"The reason anyone would believe such ludicrus claims can only be because they gave their ability to make determinations for themselves away....\" Woah, how many fallacies can he pack into one little sentance? First there is the assumption that I/we the readers \"believe\" in the first place, then he insists on it being a \"claim\" and not actually just the truth, then he dresses that false claim up as being really bad by calling it ludicrous, then he removes any other option by saying it can only be because bla bla bla \n\nSeriously?!?!?! WTF.\n\nThen he goes on to tell us what it is we do... \"we rely on mantra rather than facts (truthfully though, we rely on facts rather than mantra... those woofuckers don't last long here) And the Simu-drones label, he seems to grab onto that as if it is some sort of admission of the bline belief idea when in reality (which is demonstratable by reading this group) it was always a bit of an off-handed joke.\n\nI'll skip the Lei Gh part because I really don't know what it refers to, I only have this little snippet to go by.\n\nAgain he gets into \"claims\" of this or that... He should know by now that Scott won't say it unless he knows it to be true (but it's 2016 now so that might be wearing off) \n\nAwww fuck it... I can't keep going... It already hurts.\n\nI don't know why folks want to ingest this shit?\n\nHow many times are you going to try and multiply something by zero and expect a positive outcome?\n\nWell fuck, I refreshed this thread into anotherr window and I'm apparently pretty late for this party.

This appears to be a good \"base\" to start with working on reprogramming because it introduces a sytematic concept of dealing with things as they come. In many ways it also parallels with computer science in the form of input/processing/output. But, it proves to be rather difficult to install it on it's own into my brain because it is not complete. There is also issues of concentration and focus that are not readily overcome by that method alone which leaves you with wasted time.\nWe have covered here that time is the only thing we have of any real value, and frankly I am sick of wasting it chasing rabbits down fancy holes.\n I want to cut straight to what is important just like Pete does with any issues we discuss on SURETY :)\n\nThe Logical Fallicies lectures by Lenonard Pekoff were quite valuable as well, which when practiced can \"help\" to give you a heightened \"bullshit detector\".

I got it from a database that came up.... I am calling because there is not a census sent in from the address I am looking for but I am not sure if it is correct.  \n\nMe:  But I am  not sure of how you got this number?   \n\nAgent:  Um, I have # XXX Street, here.

You don't really know what a citizen is... are you even competent to do this job, Sam?\n\nSam: I don't say I am....Um, um I , um, ok, thank you.  (??)  All I am qualified to do is I am just calling the people that  it come up its telling me to call with the addresses and the phone numbers associated.  \n\nMe: I don't recall this number being in anyone's database.  I don't recall being a person. \n\nSam: Ok, well, I don‚Äôt;' know how the phone number got into the database ,  I don't look after that.  It just comes up in that directory.\n\nMe: Well, that is kinda scary, don't ya think because I know that my person, that that name is being used fraudulently.   Is it being used fraudulently by Statistics  Canada also?\n\nSam: Ok, I can give you a phone number to call and you can talk to someone there if you like. \n\nMe: No, I do not want to contract with you.  \n\nSam: Ok,  I am going to have to thank you and I am going to have to hang up.\n\nMe: Wonderful.

This morning I have downloaded and read some docs from the files section.\nAnd YES, I AM an Oath Keeper.

I was warmly received, and many Oath Keepers joined the NLA. I, in turn, joined Oath Keepers.\nI know full well that in order to restore the Republic of the united States of America, we must/will take back the judiciary, and restore the 1789 Constitution, and the law of the land, common law. I work very hard to that end.\nUnfortunately, as many here probably already know, common law don't cut it in court just yet... and doesn't help if you are already embroiled in a case before a court.\nWhich is why I turned my attention to usufructury, bonds, and commerce law...at least that has teeth in many cases. I would hope I could learn more from this group.\nAs regards Isaiah Whitney, I have no idea who he is, or what he is talking about.

It's the mechanism for how these law society scum take an endorsement and turn it into an order that is important to pay attention to. \n\nThese lawyers even ask for your CONSENT beforehand. I'm serious. Our (former) lawyer, Mr. Howard Cohen (http://www.cohensabsay.com), claimed that he presented us with the draft as a \"courtesy\". We all know that this officer of the court extending a a courtesy to me means I'm the one getting fucked. I even told him as much :D  \n\nMr. Cohen's LIE was to imply that my consent was a formality and/or not \"necessary\". It is worth noting that the endorsement of the Justice did not magically become an \"order\" because the Trustees did not sign. :D\n\nI am posting this after Anibal Jose Baez reminded the group that an \"Order\" can be VOIDed. I will share images of the \"Endorsement\" written by Mr. Justice Barnes and the \"Draft Order\" prepared by Ms. Howes to be sure I VOID this order correctly. \n\nI may be mistaken but it seems it only becomes an \"order\" when I SIGN. It seems counter intuitive that I would be asked to CONSENT to an order. I'm being asked to CONSENT to my own rape. :/ Is this what Gail Marie missed Scott?\n\nI would never have asked \"What is the mechanism?\" had I only focussed on the data. YOU CAN'T UNLEARN what Scott teaches. \n\n18th May 2016\n\nWITHOUT PREJUDICE\n\nKathleen A. Howes\nUnifor Legal Services Plan\n23 Regan Road\nBrampton, Ontario\nL7A 1B2\n\nMs. Howes, \n\nA smart man told me that a signature represents CONSENT and UNDERSTANDING. It can‚Äôt be anything else. \n\nThe executors have expressed repeatedly that we do not consent to these proceedings and that we respond under protest, threat and duress only. Compelling us to respond under these circumstances does not change this fact.\n\nOn August 20th, 2015 Ms. Justice Meredith Donohue declared that the consent of the executors ‚Äúis not required for this proceeding‚Äù. While this declaration is both offensive and unacceptable, if it is true, then it is only reasonable to conclude that since our consent is not required then our signatures are not required either. Therefore, in keeping with her declaration, the ‚ÄúDraft Order‚Äù that you forwarded to the executors is being respectfully returned, unsigned, with this response. \n\nShould I be mistaken, and the executors have no choice but to sign this ‚Äúdraft order‚Äù, then we will cooperate since it is only reasonable to conclude that we are the property of the Attorney General, these courts and/or the Law Society. All that I require is written proof of this from the Attorney General and/or a Justice and/or the Law Society and we will sign immediately. \n\nOtherwise bring guns. A thief doesn‚Äôt ask me for permission to take my property, so let‚Äôs abandon all pretenses and call it for what it is. If I am being compelled to sign, under threat of financial and/or physical harm, then bring guns and I will cooperate with your ‚Äúrequest‚Äù, but I will not willingly provide my consent. \n\nThe executors also do not understand the endorsement written by Mr. Justice Kofi Barnes given that the January 8th, 2016 transcript that I filed reveals that his spoken words contradict his ‚Äúendorsement‚Äù. Perhaps Ms. \"Deputy Justice\" Kathleen Howes should seek clarification from her colleague. \n\nOne more thing, Scott Duncan says ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù \n\nSincerely,\n\nBy: David-Paul, Executor for the Estate of DAVID PAUL SIP\n       ALL RIGHTS RESERVED","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"999383633430902","comment_count":0,"created_time":1463591113000,"message":"You need to take advantage of this dialog!\n\nInstead of \"A smart man told me that a signature represents CONSENT and UNDERSTANDING\", grow a pair, and say that you read the works of Scott Duncan, and that he showed you that a signature LEGALLY is PROOF of CONSENT and UNDERSTANDING.

Those that know him, learn quickly that what you are being asked to remember something, it's so he can say \"told you so\", later on. :(\n\nThis is me remembering.\n\nI stopped being surprised years ago.\n\nWe arrived in Cyprus an hour ago. I saw the AQUILAE TYSON for the first time. I then crashed into her. Scraped paint and bruised ego was the only damage. I still can't steer my own ship. I mention this because it is an event in a life nobody else has. I have it because I listened to what Scott Duncan had to say, in time.\n\nNow I'm in a strange land, on an adventure, when I thought I'd be retiring. \n\nHam-fisted censorship, endorsed by courts, is a society's death knell. It's not much better in the U.S. \n\nPeople need to start listening to Scott Duncan. I really never thought I'd say that, but Pete Daoust seems to be proving my point. Scott Duncan is also \"shadow banned\". I have not logged into Facebook for over a week. I got 3 of Scott Duncan's posts. 3.\n\nA quick look at his timeline will show that the idea of Scott Duncan posting only 3 things in a 10 day period is ludicrous. It's equally ludicrous to think that Scott Duncan didn't anticipate that. I just damaged 2 of his boats. When I told him, his primary concern was casualties. Fortunately my pride was the only casualty. \"Fix it\", was all he said. When I do, my debt will be paid. I'll never hear about it again. I know this, because that's what Scott promised it would be. I get the \"Laws\" I paid for. Do you?\n\nHe said it in 2007. \"I paid for this law and I am not getting what I paid for\". He's doing something about it.\n\nAre you?"},{"id":"998655686837030","comment_count":0,"created_time":1463472747000,"message":"Coward."},{"id":"998654246837174","comment_count":0,"created_time":1463472452000,"message":":D"},{"id":"998426416859957","attachment":{"description":"I can honestly say that I like The Master in this two part Doctor Who episode more than I like The Doctor...

It doesn't matter to me how I got here.. all that matters to me is the huge amounts of my preexisting knowledge clicking when I realised what I was reading.. I now know how I'm going to leverage all this knowledge for my benefit aswell as the benefit of the public. I knew what I knew, then I knew a great deal more. I had sleepless nights.. headaches from reading for 10-15 hours a day, for weeks.. this is not an exaggeration.. I got up, made food/coffee and ate while I went to work reading non-stop. Even after not sleeping on a couple occasions. it royally fucked my schedule, and drove my wife nuts. I read until I couldn't read anymore, until my brain stopped accepting any information. I had headaches from trying to comprehend what I had learned. I literally felt my mind expanding. It felt like new empty spaces were being formed. I had stepped into a different world. A couple months in, I see trinities everywhere, a part of my operating system has been rewritten. (my mind is open source. Scott was in the computer lab, I was in the library.) It was a one way trip. I now know what I have to do. It's a feeling I've only ever experienced one other time. It was excitment, a new frontier, It was freedom coupled with all the responsibility. The last of my fear left that moment. You showed us a structure, you closed trinities.. you didn't spoon feed people, you pointed.. some of us looked.. others.. well, let's just say words fail me. My actions will speak for me. Which is what you ask. You are one of 5 people I owe a great debt Scott, you already know the immensity of that debt and you don't give a fuck, I will give you more than you ask. I take pride in not having any sort of debts so please understand the implications of this. I also, don't kiss ass.. EVER, so this is sincere. I have my work to do. I know who I am and I'm coming. My word is my bond. I'm in this fight. I just have to be quiet about what I build.. for now. All of this is not to exclude the rest of the crew, I owe you all a great deal as well. Thank you so very, very much. (Apologies for format, grammar and spelling, it's been a longgggg day and this triggered me as I read on my phone.)"},{"id":"992626450773287","attachment":{"description":"A paragraph (from the Ancient Greek œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒøœÇ paragraphos, \"to write beside\" or \"written beside\") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea.

And the human mind is very creative and resourceful when it comes to making up excuses for NOT considering something that causes cognitive dissonance. Consider a question as simple as this: \"If you believe that it is morally wrong for YOU to do a certain thing yourself, can you make it morally right for someone else to do the same thing?\"\n\nIf someone's mind is relaxed, clear, and being honest, the concept is simple and the answer self-evident. But if someone knows where the question is headed, and is scared of facing the logical conclusion at the other end, then the brain--often subconsciously--will start to do the weirdest gymnastics and evasions, such as:\n\n1) Ignore the question and bring up some unrelated concern, such as: \"But how would we care for the poor?\"\n\n2) Intentionally \"misunderstand\" the question (even if only subconsciously): \"I can hire a plumber who can do my plumbing when I can't.\"\n\n3) Fish for some excuse for avoiding the obvious answer: \"Well a football team can delegate to the quarterback the right to call what play will be run when other people on the team have no such right.\"\n\n4) Argue about semantics: \"What do you mean by 'moral'?\" (I always respond, \"However YOU define and determine morality.\") \n\n5) Admit the obvious answer but then quickly try to change the subject: \"Well no, but that's not how government works!\"\n\nWhy is it so hard to just say, \"No, if I don't have the right to do something, I obviously can't give someone else the right to do it\"? Because... COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.\n\n(P.S. If you need me to point out why any of those five responses are irrelevant and irrational, let me know.)","link":"https://www.facebook.com/LarkenRose/posts/1157091440991370","message":"Larken Rose doesn't really like me or much of what I stand for. This, of course, means he's wrong. Not much to be done there.\n\nWhat we do agree on, is that established rules should be both voluntary and morally right. It's that last part (morals) we disagree on.\n\nPeople have a hard time grasping my political ideology because they don't actually know anything :/\n\nWhen it comes to commerce, I am an Anarcho Capitalist.\nWhen it comes to knowledge, I am a Marxist\nAbove all I am a humanist, and a scientist in equal portions.\n\nIt leads to the truth faster.\n\nIf it's TRUE, it doesn't matter who says it. Larken Rose doesn't like me, but I like him, very much. He stands for what he BELIEVES to be true. He harms NOBODY and does NOT advocate violence except in self-defense. He is very public with his views and will even change them when he sees sufficient evidence to warrant doing so.\n\nHe is ALWAYS asking EVERY \"authority\" this one question. He's done it for YEARS. He's doing it again here, and I want to encourage the asking of this question, because it is the program you have in your head, that avoids  the answer, because there is a LOT of bullshit attached to it, and answering \"no\" destroys ANY \"moral\" ground you may have, is always running.\n\n \"If you believe that it is morally wrong for YOU to do a certain thing yourself, can you make it morally right for someone else to do the same thing\"?\n\nOBVIOUSLY the answer is NO. It cannot BE anything else, and the second you start making excuses for answering \"yes\", I am, by default, BETTER THAN YOU.\n\nLarken Rose is RIGHT here. Nothing you say, think, feel, or believe, will change that. \n\nNow ask a Government Worker that same question.","name":"Larken Rose","parent_id":"108191869214671_1157091440991370","story":"Scott Duncan shared Larken Rose's post to the group: THE TENDER FOR LAW.","type":"link","comments":[{"id":"989248367777762","comment_count":0,"created_time":1462051468000,"message":"Why would you waver from what is RIGHT!"},{"id":"989243981111534","comment_count":0,"created_time":1462051136000,"message":"Of course not!

The hospital I was born in has no record because the records room their microfiche was stored in caught fire total loss. The NORTH CAROLINA VITAL STATISTICS does not have any record in their vault. I searched in nearby counties on the off chance there may have been a records transfer error. Nothing. \n\nMy question is what do I do to prove I am who I am? All of the state issued credentials I have expire in the next 15 months. I have old military ID's, and old military credentials when I was a contractor, and a current until next year driver's license.

Before we get started we are going to refer to the JURISDICTION I am most familiar with.  You will find mirrors of this in any JURISDICTION that uses a world reserve currency.\n\nIf you live in Buttfuck Montana I will not be able to point you to the ACT and/or STATUTE that says what I am going to show you here.  \n\nhttp://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/English/elaws_statutes_90c11_e.htm\n\nThe URL above will point you to the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO so you can sing along...\n\nBefore I start let's review a few LEGAL DEFINITIONS.  Those who have been studying the Maxims of Law will be familiar with the Maxim that says, \"The inclusion of one thing is the exclusion of everything else.\"  Like all good LEGAL documents I'm going to give away the answer right at the beginning and explain why this is true.\n\nEvery one who has been a victim of the CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY has been profoundly aware that FRAUD is occurring, and has been unaware of how to identify this FRAUD.  In order to have a child removed from a mother and/or father's custody an ORDER must be issued from the court that cites this very ACT.  There are exceptions to this RULE (imminent physical threat to a child, WARRANT from a JUSTICE OF THE PEACE inter alia), but that's not what we are covering here.  In this writing I am only going to focus on the long, drawn-out, cash-producing process laughingly called family law.\n\nIn every ACT and STATUTE, words are defined in the context of that ACT and/or STATUTE.  If the word \"light\" is defined in a STATUTE as \"darkness\", then in the context of that STATUTE, light means darkness.  A \"JUSTICE\" orders the kidnapping (and it is kidnapping) and/or alienation of a child with an ORDER in the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO.  So let's look at the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO.  What does \"ORDER\" mean in the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO?  Let's go see the interpretations section and its definitions....\n\n‚ÄúORDER‚Äù INCLUDES a REFUSAL to make an ORDER; (‚Äúarr√™t√©, ordre et ordonnance‚Äù)...WHAT?\n\n...just looking through the ACT to see if there's a bit more detail here...nope, that's it.  That's all it says.  I assume the parties who drafted this ACT were never taught that you should never use the word you're defining in a definition.\n\nIn THE TENDER FOR LAW our standard operating procedure is to look up every single word, even if you think you know what it means; and in every case it always turn out that you don't.  So let's go through that sentence, one word at a time.  In our fresh new definition of \"ORDER\" we are \"INCLUDING\" something, which in legalese means we are EXCLUDING everything else.  In this case we are including a REFUSAL(?)  How can you include a refusal? (hey don't look at me...I didn't write this...I'm just telling you what it says)\n\nSince refusal is not defined in this ACT we'll have to step up to a more general level.  Let's see what Black's Law 9th Edition has to say about the word \"refusal\":\n\n\"An opportunity to accept or reject something before it is offered to others; the right or privilege of having this opportunity.\"...well, there's a privilege worth waiving!  In fact I dare say that of all the privileges and benefits one would wish to waive, this should at least be in your top five.  Dean Clifford and the guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth (\"How do I sound\"? - Tony Butros, HOW TO WITH DEAN CLIFFORD-Ep13 Family Law www.blogtalkradio.com) are selling this as a benefit. \n\nIn fact, they're asking you to beg for it when they tell you to use APPLICATIONS and MOTIONS (...Yeh, you like that don't 'ya bitch!).\n\nRather than begging for your own victimization, a little effort tearing this apart will serve you much better.  Since we're talking about ORDERS and MAKING ORDERS let's take a quick peek at the word \"MAKE\" since we have Black's Law lying open here...\n\nMAKE, according to Black's Law 9th Edition, \"To legally perform, as by executing, signing, OR delivering (a document) (to make a contract)\"\n\nOh look, they use the word \"OR\"!  Don't you just love it when they give you a selection?  Always remember legalese does NOT actually \"lie\", it simply presumes you know what the words mean (as a CIVILIAN! HAR!  Oh, I slay me!).\n\nSo when a \"JUSTICE\" MAKES an ORDER he gets a selection from the \"bullshit buffet\" that is the LAW, but he can only pick one, OR the other.  Neither of these options actually apply to YOU.  By ACCEPTING the ORDER you are in fact, EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS to \"BENEFIT\" from it, before everyone else can.  Yes, you are accepting SURETY before anyone else gets a chance; and while I'm not one to tell you how to run your affairs, I personally think that that would be a MISTAKE!  And we all know what to do about MISTAKES.  \n\nNow I want you to \"fire up\" that little lump of protoplasm you laughingly call a brain, and ask yourself, \"Which makes more sense?  Begging to be part of the JURISDICTION and all of its \"BENEFITS\" or following the Number 1 Rule of the Universe (Scott is ALWAYS right!  Especially as regards LAW).  Lawyers used to come to me when they got in over their heads, and I was shoved A LOT of payola under the table for my services.  Single mothers reading this know how to express their gratitude.  You may APPLY to Tara for the opportunity to provide remuneration.\n\nSo let's go through this fascinating definition one more time, translated to laymen's terms:\n\nIn the context of the CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT OF ONTARIO a \"JUSTICE\" will issue an opportunity to ACCEPT a BENEFIT before everyone else.  So basically ORDER in this context actually OFFERS YOU the RIGHT TO DECLINE.  I guarantee that none of you who have had your children stolen, DECLINED that ORDER.  In fact I dare say you ACCEPTED it.  That would be a MISTAKE.  \n\nIssuing a NOTICE OF MISTAKE will correct this, because another Maxim of Law says, \"That which can be done, can be undone\".  Serving by registered mail a modified NOTICE OF MISTAKE to all participating PARTIES, will remedy this MISTAKE.  \n\nAnd now we will cover our new \"word of the day\", \"PETITION\":\n\nPETITION, according to Black's Law 9th Edition, \"A formal written request presented to a court or other official body.\"\n\nThose few of you who actually have a fucking clue who I am, know that among my many titles is ADMIRAL.  I exercise my RIGHTS and DUTIES strictly through ADMIRALTY, so I totally know what I'm talking about here.  I, as an ADMIRAL, have TRUSTEES SERVING me.  I do not bark ORDERS at my TRUSTEES.  I only do that to my inferiors.  My TRUSTEES are most certainly NOT my inferiors.  When I need a task performed for AQUILAE I REQUEST.  Returning to the definition of PETITION you will see that this is also a request.  I therefore PETITION my TRUSTEES to execute tasks on behalf of the TRUST.  TRUSTEES do not serve an ADMIRAL; an ADMIRAL SERVES HIS TRUSTEES.  The \"payment\" for this \"service\" is the TRUSTEE'S OATH to GRANT ALL MY REQUESTS.  It is the COURT's DUTY to do the same.\n\nThis group's name \"THE TENDER FOR LAW\" is actually a translation to layman's terms of \"THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER\".  They mean the same thing.  So naturally money comes into the picture.  Remember our group's Maxim...\"Follow the money\".  In this particular case we don't want to follow any money, we want to stop the flow of money.\n\nAll of you have heard the old adage, \"The buck stops here.\"  Translated to legalese, \"the buck stops here\" = \"NON-NEGOTIABLE\".  In the construction of our PETITION we are going to contain, in its body, a cessation of negotiation.  When dissecting documents that have a financial interest, we have learned that documents signed by a \"PERSON\" are considered NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS under the LAW.  \n\nTherefore in our PETITION, the first words that appear should be NON-NEGOTIABLE.  This is similar to putting \"WITHOUT PREJUDICE\" on the top of a document.  NEGOTIATE does not mean bargain or haggle, it means to EXECUTE a financial transaction.  NON-NEGOTIABLE literally means \"the buck stops here\".  Reading through Black's Law will show you numerous types of petitions, and reading them in the context demonstrated here will make these petitions very, very clear...even a chick can do it.\n\nAt this point I would like everyone to know that I DO NOT provide LEGAL service; I only point you in the right direction.  Therefore I cannot draw up a petition for you as I did with the NOTICE OF MISTAKE.  NOTICE OF MISTAKE existed in the real world before I typed up any document regarding it.  Therefore I was quoting, which means I have not stepped outside of any LEGAL restriction.  When The second I issue a petition you can bet your sorry, incompetent asses I'll be quoting it here.  Until that happens though, you'd best use the comments section to ask any questions you may have.  For the sake of your children do not listen to Dean and the guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth; they are deliberately misleading you!  When you discover this is true (and you will if you listen to them), you are welcomed to board any AQUILAE vessel and beg me for forgiveness where I promise there will be a loyal and capable TRUSTEE standing by to kick you in the face, and toss you overboard.\n\nSo post your questions and keep on topic. As this is the most important thread, our fun banter is not permitted here!\n\n...except when I do it.","name":"Child and Family Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.

From Greek, dispersion, from diaspeirein; to scatter, from dia- + speirein to sowthe movement, migration, or scattering of a people away from an established or ancestral homeland.\n===============================================\n2016 has been an interesting year, so far.  I'm now at the phase of my initiative where people are starting to put some pieces together.  Those of you who have studied under me, are familiar with the ground rules of any large-scale operation.   The principle one is, \"While you're building, NEVER LET THEM TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY\"!\n\nUnfortunately this rule has now been broken, because people are now starting to take me seriously.  Most of 2010 was occupied with the ongoing research and development of cryptographic currencies.  One of the first things I set out to do, once cryptographic currencies turned out to be viable, was to seek out those who understood the legal ramifications of what was being built, and people who understand what money is.  I'm sad to say that in 2010, the only ones that were even qualified to hear what I had to say, were a few smart Libertarians and the FREE-DUMBERS.  I actively sought out Robert Menard.  This, of course, turned out to be a colossal failure.   While Menard was more than qualified, it didn't change the fact that he's a lying, drunk, con artist.   A year later, Dean Clifford sought me out.  He was more interested in the AQUILAE TRUST than he was in any fancy computer money.  Menard actually tried to \"mansplain\" that the whole purpose behind money is that you can \"buy things with it\", and made the ever popular comment, \"What if the server goes down?\"  It's the one thing I've noticed about the FREE-DUMBERS.  They really seem to hate technology.  Dean Clifford aggressively fought to avoid learning anything.  I point out to everyone who will listen, how intimately tied to computer science all of your lives are.  I've lived nearly half a century on this planet, and all the things I grew up with, are gone.  \n\nThere are no telephones.  There are computers pretending to be telephones.  There are no radios.  There are computers pretending to be radios.  There are no televisions.  There are computers pretending to be televisions.  To this day, I still get confused looks when I say that there are no cars; there are just rolling unsecured networks of computers, pretending to be cars.  It's a matter of PUBLIC RECORD that I literally pretended to be a \"retard\" so I could get access to computers.  I wasn't the only one.  His name was Peter Sheppard.  He had no interest in computer science.  He was just lazy and didn't want to do any actual school work, which I totally respected him for.   That action was one of my first \"practise what you preach\" exercises.  When you're smarter than everyone else around you, the opinions and perceptions of everyone else around you become irrelevant.   This was my first real-world exercise of this concept, and it's not as easy as I make it sound.  I was also fourteen years-old.  At the time there were a lot of factors working against my interest over which I had absolutely no control.  \n\nNow in 2016, I find myself in the unique position of understanding more than all of my fellow man.  This is not an arrogant declaration.  It is a fact.  I have simply dedicated more effort to the task than everybody else in history; because at that early age, I fell in love with computers.  At the time they were just simple enough for the average man to understand.   I could tell you exactly how a Commodore 64 CPU worked.  I have no fucking clue how an i7 works, but I do know from those fundamentals acquired in the early days, the things that must be true.  This means I can understand how an i7 works, should I choose to.  Is the Internet what I thought it would become in the old days?  Hell no!  Those few times I attempted to express to my family what it was I was doing, and studying, and spending my time on, they literally labelled me \"crazy\", and told everyone I was pretending to be part of a \"secret society\".   They just shrugged this off, as the by-product of having been sold to the government.  Yes, they really did that shit in the '70s; and only to people with \"Noble Lineage\".  I'll be covering that on Diaspora when our POD is ready....\n\n...but I digress...\n\nYou read the above and there's no way anyone reading this without context could think that these things are anything but the ramblings of a madman...except they're all true, and I've shown that they're all true, and I'm going to show more truth.  \n\nThese are truths you simply couldn't understand without acquiring the knowledge you've gained so far.  It's starting to happen.  People outside the LAW SOCIETY and the upper caste of the ATTORNEY GENERAL are starting to take me seriously.   I will admit that there is this latent fear that I'll wake up in the morning with Vice saying they totally found Satoshi Nakamoto this morning...honest...and a really bad picture from high school serving as the background.  But I think I'm ok.  I don't have much to worry about, because as I've said before, it's really difficult to sell somebody an idea.  It is, however, stupidly simple to sell them money.  I have made a lot of people, a lot of money -- literally.   \n\nBy the time I started THE TENDER FOR LAW, which to this day is the only place I publish under my own name, there were over fifty (50) different crypto-currencies in existence.  When I first started the group, Dean Clifford had just been ratified into the AQUILAE TRUST.   He was actually an administrator of this group, which brings me to this group.\n\nYou people are my only contact with the \"outside world\", and the minimal contact I've had with you in this insincere medium, has profoundly affected your lives.  As I ponder, while writing, I'm surprised at the number of names that are on this list.  I get an indescribable rush (that I don't quite understand yet) when you people benefit tangibly from what I have shown you.  Outside of this medium there are others who literally became millionaires over night.  Eighty percent of them crashed and burned, because they stopped listening to me.  That other twenty percent thought right, and valued the right things.  All of them feel they owe me a debt, even though they've paid their debt -- and I certainly don't want to discourage that!  If people want to feel gratitude, and have the urge to give me shit, I encourage them to do so.  Just make sure that shit is a consumable that everyone can use.   If I need anything else I can make/get it myself.   Again I digress...\n\nThis is about people starting to take me seriously.\n\nThe wrong people are starting to make the \"right\" connections.  There's nothing I can really do to stop it.  We live in a world right now, that has things humanity has never had before.  This very medium I'm talking to you on, will one day seem as antiquated as a console stereo seems today.  When computer science is at the core of who you are, all you do is look ahead at the possibilities - based on what exists right now.  These people have always existed.  They're just really well equipped now.  I can build things for less than $100 that would have cost thousands fewer than ten years ago.  In the time that my sister group - THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING - has existed, you've literally watched the evolution of the system-on-a-chip (SOC); and today the Raspberry Pi 0 is $5.  To purchase that capability in 1997, would have cost about $5,000.   These monster machines that form the core of who I am, are now commodities that can be bought for $5.  The time that I took advantage of that foresight I had, those many years ago which compelled me to pretend to be a retard, is a time that will never come again.  \n\nThis has caused the most distinct separation between you, the reader, and myself.  \n\nIn every way that matters we are \"equal\", in as much as we're both semi-evolved chimps that made it this far.  Both of us can buy a Pi 0 for $5.00.  Only one of us actually understand it.  It's my \"super-power\".  There's literally no computer I can't understand, and I find myself in the odd position of having to ask, \"What do I do with this super power?\"  It's only when your government leash-holders turned on me, that I decided CHANGE EVERYTHING was the answer.  It's one of the reasons I'm a rabid backer of OPEN SOURCE and FREE SOFTWARE.  This is an issue that none of you really understand, yet it will impact all of your lives.  You may not love computers as I do, or even have a desire to understand how they work.  Many of you are just happy enough to believe they're just \"magic 'pooter boxes\"...and that's it.  But it's YOUR RIGHT to understand.  You've heard me say before, that none of you really grasp what has been stolen from you, and I'm here to tell you, that this is one of the things that is BEING stolen from you.  The right to understand how this technology works is one of the most important things in your life today.  Yet none of you are even qualified to understand the issue at hand.  I hope I've painted a broad picture of it.  I'm sure I frighten you when I point out that your life is intimately tied to computer science, and none of you know anything about computer science.   \n\nThere are interests at play that want to remove that RIGHT from you.  They want to make this global ignorance a permanent state.  This is very serious, and it's why I won't charge money for software.  You idiots will post videos of a Rube Goldberg machine, guaranteed re-posts if it ends with something hitting a cat...but computer science is way beyond that, and the rules are very simple to understand.  Everything in the universe is ON or OFF, just like the real universe.  I've said it before.  I can speak to the universe, and it will speak back in numbers - numbers only computer science can understand.  As you're about to see, all of the above is connected.\n\nWhen people start taking you seriously when you make \"crazy claims\" such as \"collapse the banking system and start a war\", the first thing they'll attempt to do, is discredit you.  They, of course, have to resort to lying to accomplish it.  The strangest thing is, the people who perpetrate these lies are never called to account for the damage they do.   The recent Ghomeshi*  trial is an example of this.  For those unfamiliar with the case, a prominent Toronto broadcaster was very publicly charged with aggravated assault, and aggravated sexual assault, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison with the possibility of parole after twenty-five years.  This was some serious shit.  When the story broke, more \"victims\" came out to testify.  The Feminazis wanted to hang the guy on the spot.  The TL;DR of the trial was that this Toronto broadcaster like to do some fucked-up shit in bed, and three cunts thought it would be a good idea to lie about it.   During the trial, the Feminazis were there to show their support for these women that the Justice specifically said were lying.   That's the world in 2016.  These women deliberately lied in court, as they plotted in public on fucking Facebook.  \n\nI mention this because this is something I'm going to be dealing with soon.  Up until now, we had Menard and Dan Lien-Your-Name Wilson lying about me publicly, and that's about it.  But I've been engaging LAWYERS publicly head-on, hitting them with the questions that will compel they to lie every time - and provably lie.   There are questions like, \"Does the LAW SOCIETY CLAIM OWNERSHIP of all INDIVIDUALS?\", and \"What does an ATTORNEY ATTORN?\"  Many of you have been eagerly watching these exchanges, mostly because I make you; and it surprises you every single time how quickly they start lying.  That's what lawyers do.  They lie.   It starts with the law degree itself.  The stereotypical Jewish mother wants her son to become a doctor or a lawyer.  Why does this stereotype exist?  Well, it's just something that \"everybody knows\".  As I've explained and shown you for years, when \"everybody knows\" something, it means there is a lot of money and a large-scale agenda at work.  By large-scale I mean time.  In this case it's an attempt to place the art of lying on the same level of respectability as the practice of medicine.  These are literally people who want to be associated with the STEM fields -- but with an art's degree.  Never forget that.  A law degree is an Art's Degree, like \"Gender Studies\", or \"Philosophy\".  \n\nSo remember that when you see your aunt, or brother, or cousin who is a lawyer.  These are 3's dressed up as 9's.  Everything about them is a lie.  It is important to remember that they chose this, and invested four long years learning the necessary memory and recitation rituals, that will get you that magic LAW DEGREE.  For the public record, I have two of them, and I did not get them under the name, Scott Duncan.  A computer scientist that studies law seems almost like a contradiction in terms.  I'm a man who had a life plan at the age of thirteen, because overnight, everything changed.  \n\nAs I approach the half century mark, all of you get even more and more confusing.  My companion throughout this entire journey was computer science itself, and the thing about computer science is that once you truly understand it, the nature of that understanding compels you to always look forward.  To look at the most mundane things with a computer attached to it...and see the infinite possibilities.  I'm certain to this day that you still don't understand what I mean when I say there are literally trillions of dollars worth of free shit just waiting to be exploited.  Open source and free software are your only legal protection from having your right to understand these magnificent machines, taken away from you - by strangers serving an agenda who don't give a shit about you.  \n\nSo that's pretty much my last gem for you before people start throwing shit at me.  \n\nRight now they're throwing the expendable, and the mentally ill, at me.  Agents through agency.  Somebody the cops have frightened.  Somebody who's going to court, and is hoping for leniency if they cooperate.  This gives the government plausible deniability, but it's just a matter of time before the agents themselves are deployed.  Until then there are feeble attempts to lie about me, in play, one of which is below for your consideration.   I have no idea what lies await, so I can't even preemptively defend myself against what's coming.   Who knows?  That fact that I'm posting this may even cause future plans to be aborted.  See, here's the thing.  The government's \"home turf\" is also my \"home turf\".  I was their property for three (3) years, and their mercenary for ten (10).  I was literally designed to harm you.  Your government did this.  It's practically instinct in me; and as compelling as that programming I received in those three years was/is, my brain literally had better things to do.  It allowed me to lay out a rough plan, one that I had to do alone - because you're all too stupid and love your bullshit too much.  That's why lying is so compelling for you.  There's literally an art's degree for lying, and substantial compensation for learning it well.  There is no such thing as a \"good lawyer\".  IT'S A FUCKING ARTS DEGREE FOR LYING!  If you know any lawyers, and they CLAIM not to know this, guess what....they're lying!  They've got the diploma on their wall to prove it.  TRUST but VERIFY.\n\nI had the good/mis fortune of calling a lawyer \"friend\".  His name was Steve Krupnick, and as promised at a later date, I shall tell the story of his son, Harrison, and his role in that last day which I'm sure still confuses him.  However, when I publish that, it's a bell I can't un-ring.  It will get a lot of attention globally, and I don't think Facebook should benefit from it directly.\n\nWhich brings me to the last subject which connects all of this.\n\nI'm talking about, of course, Diaspora.\n\nIf you're an avid follower of...well, me, you will note that historically my very first post on Facebook was the announcement of Diaspora going live.  Now I want everyone to look at the parallels between Diaspora and Bitcoin, because I gotta tell 'ya, I've gotten a lot of grief over the years about how crypto-currencies were a \"failure\".   It seemed like every month there was an announcement of the death of Bitcoin.   Well, the same thing is happening with Diaspora.  Wired magazine has announced, no fewer than three times, that the Diaspora project is a failure.   Yet here I am, still endorsing it like it's the next great thing.  \n\nUnlike cryptographic currencies that are literally selling you money, Diaspora is more of an idea.  It's an idea that I'm intimate with, and if deployed right and adopted by enough people, it will change everything, because we all collectively have the power to change Diaspora on the fly.  The idea behind Diaspora is that you decide what a social network is.   Because some douche came up with the concept of \"social network\", and the douches that adopted it seem to be the ones deciding for you.  I don't want to build these things for you.  I don't care if you ever understand your computer or not.  It's important to me that you always have the option of understanding.  That's what open/free software is all about.  You may not even know this is a right you want to protect, and that's how most of your rights are stolen.  They're stolen because you don't understand something.  This is basically how things are run.  Yes there are people who \"know all the secrets\", but they're not in charge of anything.  They're used until they are no longer useful, and then they're disposed of -- like any other commodity.  Virtually every system in the government is a sorting mechanism for that commodity, and as we begin our migration to Diaspora I'm going to explain to you in painstaking detail, how to navigate and exploit that mechanism.   What you do with that knowledge is entirely up to you.  Know ahead of time that the government loves to throw its \"agents\" under the bus, which they will most certainly do every time you leverage the things I'm about to show you on Diaspora.  \n\nBut that's for the future.  For now, people are going to start spending a lot of time and effort, doing nothing but lying about me.  These attacks are going to get more, and more vicious.  This one literally celebrates our victimization as lying about me didn't seem to be working.  Remember, lawyers don't care what you think of them.  They have their own \"society\", remember?  So what you think of them is functionally irrelevant.  The LAW SOCIETY literally considers you \"property\", but they rely on your ignorance.  If you could convey to cows at Burger King's cattle ranches what their owners have determined for them, I'm sure you'd get a stampede.  You'll notice I'm not directly pointing you to a location where you can confirm that lawyer's think this.  Instead I'm engaging the lawyers themselves, publicly, so you can see how they react.  Their reactions say way more than me pointing at the documentary evidence ever could.  Of all the things that aren't hidden, this one is the most hidden.  For here in reality, none of this is hidden.  That's how they get away with it.  Except, I'm telling everybody how everything works - and I'm signing my name to it.  \n\nI was a speciality commodity specifically designed to harm you.  But as much as I want to, I don't have the right, and neither do you...and neither do they.\n\nLet this serve as a synopsis of my time here.  Many of you see the writing on the wall at Facebook, and I'll be using Diaspora in much the same way.  My mark will be left by being the only one who used Facebook the way that I did.  I changed the conditions of the test.  That will always be my only vindication.  Let it also serve as advice.  If you ever find yourself in the position where you could change the conditions of the test, don't be afraid.  Do it!  If you don't, you'll regret it the rest of your life.  \n\nSo, anyway...here's somebody deliberately lying about me, and celebrating Judicial corruption.\n\n[Cowards deleted the post]\n\n...so instead, let's look a a tread where MOST of the participants now hate me because \"reasons\".\n\nGail Marie = 2-faced cunt.\nAdam Thomas = Well, Adam thomas\n\n..and a whole lot of others.\n\nLook how \"grateful\" they all are. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/tenderforlaw/permalink/532494196786517/","type":"status","comments":[]},"462493170453287_979232825445983":{"id":"462493170453287_979232825445983","created_time":1460459840000,"full_picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12998564_10206227672117728_2821020694996291397_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=86de2da118d09bad400d9095647c1c15&oe=5B32B69B","link":"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206227672117728&set=gm.979232825445983&type=3","message":"Yep, choo choo again.

Over the last several weeks, and after working with our developers here in Montreal, we have concluded that this is currently not the case with Ethereum.\n\nI am doing this because the technology is simply too immature at this point to create a high quality course using the materials, documentation, and APIs which are changing on a daily basis.\n\nI am not confident that the final product of this course would be as good as it could be given that building anything with this technology at this point is uncertain. I do not want to lead our students astray and I do not want our developers searching for the pot of gold when the rainbow has yet to appear. I cannot put my heart into something when I know the final product will not be as good as it could have been.\n\nI understand you may be disappointed we will not be going ahead with the Ethereum Technology Course. If this technology turns out to be all that it is promised to be, it will indeed be a game-changer. However, at this point it still has much to prove. \n\nOnce Ethereum has proven itself as a technology, once it has a useful and working application on its platform, then that may be a reason to revive this course. However, until further notice, I am suspending product creation.\n\nYou Decide\n\nHere's what I'm going to do for the students who have already paid the entrance fee for this course.\n\nI'm giving every student access to our already completed, highly regarded Bitcoin Economics Course. This course is created similar to the Ethereum Technology Course but rather than focusing on programming tutorials of bitcoin, it dives into the public key cryptography of the bitcoin network, the attributes of digital money, and some of the ways bitcoin could disrupt our current political configuration. Ever unit comes with both a written and video intruction. There are 15 lessons in total and 3 examinations to test your knowledge. I'm confident you will find these materials highly engaging and instructive.\n\nThe course currently features a $199 tuition fee. You will be gaining access for free.\n\nThe second option is to opt out of the Bitcoin Economics Course offer and instead decide on a full refund. If you go this route, you need to hit reply and let me know your intention. If you paid with bitcoin and want a full refund, you will also need to send along your accompanying bitcoin address you would like to receive the payment to. Your refund will be processed within the next 48 hours.\n\nFor the students who have registered for both courses, you will receive a full refund.\n\nI appreciate your cooperation with this matter and I'm confident you will find the Bitcoin Economics Course one of your most valuable resources for understanding the implications of digital money.\n\nI am available today for any questions you may have.\n\nThank you.\n\nTravis Patron"},{"id":"977047418997857","comment_count":0,"created_time":1460127266000,"message":"^^^THAT is exactly why I bought the class he was selling!

I will give you a brief history.\nI was in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic. He threatened to kill me and I went to police and because of his behavior and things he was doing police advised me to leave immediately before he killed me and to get my children out of the house. \nSo I left and my ex never requested to see the boys or bothered for months. Then we went to court and I had my children taken away. This was the start of denied access and the loss of my children. The OCL became involved and my boys fought to get out of the house and at 9 and 14 to start their voices were never heard. They threatened their dad they would call CAS if he didn't let them come live with me. The OCL report stated how abusive he was, the boys fear of him, he coaches them on what to say and they were afraid he would hit them like he did their sister. Their older sister was put into foster care at the age of 14 because of his abuse towards her as well.\nI had a lawyer at the time and he dismissed himself stating to me he has never seen anything like this before and knew he couldn't help me. The judges in Guelph gave my ex whatever he wanted and all the broken court orders and my ex's behavior, not to mention the boys wishes were ignored. \nJust to remind you this is happening because my ex husbands mother works within this small courthouse as a court services officer and she works along side the judges, especially Justice Belleghem and Justice Price.\nIn 2012 during a case conference with the Judge assigned for this, Justice Mossip she seen through what was happening. She made my ex husband cry with her take on everything he was doing and how bad of a father he was. She forced him to give me back the boys.\nThey came to live with me and the boys were happy again. Although he continued with his abusive ways and threats even to the point the OCL's boss acknowledged an abusive incident to me through email although they felt it wasn't a child protective issue. My younger son starting throwing up before visits and the older one didn't want to go either. The older one in highschool at this time. They were forced to go.\nA few months later I was admitted into hospital and my mom came to watch the boys. She dropped them off for their weekend visit and he then refused to return the boys and was in court two days later with the help of his mom, no OCL present and had all my parental rights removed based on fabrications and nothing that he could substantiate. \nJust to point out at the beginning when I had no source of income and had the boys for 6 months he was never made to pay child support or spousal support although he has a high income. Again in 2012 he was never made to paid child support either because he didn't feel like it. I was only working part time when I won them back.\nSO February 2013 when he stole them back he was given a cost award and child support based on amount my ex husband thought I should make. For the next year he denied all communication, against a court order again and I was left living off $800 monthly. I would have been homeless if it wasn't for my mom's help. I'm a nurse just to point out and do now work full time.The Ontario Law that you cannot deduct more than 50% of someone's net pay did not apply in my case. Also the fact that I was off work until the following January.\nFinally in the fall 2013 I brought a motion after several attempts as this Superior Court in Guelph informed me I was not allowed to file motions against him. I had to contact the Director of Court Operations in order to do so. I finally was able to see a judge and she wrote on the court order I was paying way to much in child support, although didn't award it back to me just lowered it. She also gave me back access to my boys which he still denied anyway. I brought Contempt Motions and all ignored the Judges wouldn't even read them and put them aside.\nBy January 2014 my younger son phoned me and begged me to come get him as his dad was mean. I phoned his dad who we don't ever speak. He was drunk and I recorded this call, transcribed it and it was accepted into court for the trial. He was cocky and kept belittling me in front of the boys. He said he would go to trial because he already knew he would win, he had no worries.\nI brought motions to change venue and those all denied and written in an order that his mother just was not allowed to touch our file.\nStill no access and trial mangement conferences they manipulated the judges and ensured we could not have Justice Mossip who was assigned because she wouldn't do what they wanted so they made sure it was Justice Price.\nDuring a conference to set the trial date we ended up having Justice Herold who informed me that the OCL and opposing council had been setting up a trial without my knowledge so I wouldn't show up. He had a few words for the OCl and opposing side. He said due to the nature of the case which he has read evidence he was going to appoint himself to do the trial and he looked at me and said the boys would be given back where they belong, with me.\nA day before trial I got a phone call from the courthouse and they were delaying the trial by a day. This was because they appointed Justice Herold into a different case so they could have their beloved Justice Belleghem. As soon as he walked in he looked at me and said I would not win and he would be careful how he worded his endorsement incase I appealed his decision. The trial was reduculous and Justice Belleghem reminded me daily I would not win, he was rude not only to me but my witnesses.\nDuring cross examination I was able to go through 90% of my evidence but he allowed the opposing side to drag the trial out to 7 days by this time. My ex husband admitted on the stand that he refused me access and he admitted it all. He even said he knew I was a good mother and the boys were well taken care of when in my care. BUt he didn't want me to see them.\nWe had assets including RRSP's, Pensions etc. I requested spousal support and child support retro for what was owing to me.\nIn September 2014 his decision came out and he gave my ex husband everything. I was left with no assets and child support paid to me, no spousal support and he awarded my ex husband child support based on a much higher amount then what I actually make annually. Plus $25,000 in court fees was awarded and $10,000 awarded as child support.\nI appealed the decision. In February 2015 I brought a motion in Divisional Court in Brampton and to my surprise if Justice Price didn't walk in. A Guelph Judge really! He was rude and ignored why I brought the motion and only concentrated on opposing council who was requesting the appeal be moved to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. At this time circumstances had changed and I moved back to town down the street from my ex and the boys were always at my place. Also I had found out our older son was not living with his dad and hadn't been since he was forced back in 2013, he was living with a friend. He started staying with me and officially moved all his stuff in with me by April. Justice Price ignored everything. The only thing I got that day was a stay put on the $25,000 cost award.\nThey were awarded for the case to be moved to the Court of Appeal. Justice Price wrote a date on the order that the appeal was to be filed with the Court of Appeal and funny the file never got transferred there. I made trips to the Divisional Court and they somehow lost my file. Finally one day I wouldn't leave their counter until someone found the file because I had by this time one week left to complete the appeal. They finally found it and apolagized and said they just don't know how it got misplaced. Corruption at its finest.\nIt was a good thing I did my research because the Court of Appeal received the file with 3 days remianing for me to perfect my appeal. Although that day it was complete and I didn't have to fix anything.\nIn June I brought a motion to the Court of Appeal and my older son appeared with me. The Judge was very annoyed that Justice Price did not deal with the issues in February. He had duty council contact his office and inform him of this. It is written in the order that Justice Price was contacted and agreed to call a conference to deal with the issues. Well within a week Justice Price recused himself due to the conflict of interest and stated I could just go back to Guelph. Justice Price was the Judge who took my kids away and all parental rights in 2013, now recuses himself.\nSo I pleaded with the Appeal Court to give me a speedy hearing due to the circumstances and they agreed to the beginning of September 2015. That is until the OCL decided to involve themselves after the appeal was perfected. They had a conference call and the Judge was very rude to me and ordered me to copy everything and I had to serve her. She requested from the court that the hearing be delayed. She was called in by my ex husband to help him. The hearing then got set to November. \nNovember came and we sat there all day as we were going to be the last case. Once the Justices spoke to me and they said \"are you ready\" the OCL stood up and said there was a problem. She filed material and sadly I was never served. Exactly what they had been doing because they didn't want those Judges. The case was then remanded until December.\nMy ex husband didn't even show up and the Judges had nothing to say to me and just let me talk and only reminded me when I had a few minutes left. \nWhen it was there turn they had lots of questions in regards to how much money they wanted etc. Oh and all the OCL documents they filed she was defending my ex husband. Nothing about the boys, she requested evidence be removed etc.\nIt took only 3 days with 5 years of evidence and the Judges came back with they agreed with everything Justice Belleghem did and were dismissing my appeal although they accept my ex husbands cross appeal for more money in child support and $10,000 awarded in costs.\n\n3 DAYS!!!!!\n\nThey completely ignored the evidence that my son has lived with me throughout the entire year. He was expelled from school which I brought documentation from the school, although my ex husband filed a affidavit stating my son lives with him full time as he stays there 1-2 nights a week and he attends school full time and thriving. His word against documentation from the school. As well I had evidence from my apt management that my son lives here full time and a letter written by my son about the misrepresentation by the OCL and she did not disclose what he and his brother wanted. I lost everything.\n\nI sent a formal 136 page complaint to the Law Society with all the evidence and they requested in January the Appeal Material. They just sent me a letter and acknowledged all the corruption and things done wrong although in the last paragraph they state they don't see anything was done wrong and they are closing the case. I wrote a complaint to the Judicial Council and they dismissed it as well against Justice Beleghem.\n\nSO now here I am and the garnishments are starting. All of my pay which will put me in a shelter. My son has lived here for over a year and he was awarded child support based on an amount I don't make and I provided my income tax assessments, they didn't care it was what my ex requested in child support. Plus although the $25,000 cost award was stayed, opposing council was asked what they wanted and it was never reinstated and not asked for. Now my ex is trying to collect.\nMy older son is also over 18 now and working. My ex husband continues to state my son lives there and is in school full time.\n\nHERE IS MY PROBLEM PLEASE HELP!!!!\n\nI found some funds so I obtain a lawyer to fix this child support and cost awards as its undue hardship and I will be living in a shelter. Its fraud and he won't stop.\nI can show his lies in a sworn affidavit and documentation from the school. I have a letter from the management here that our son lives here as well I have all the receipts for clothes and food etc.\nI have contacted law firms from Toronto etc and not one firm will take on my case. They say its too complex and they won't step foot in the Guelph courthouse.\n\nSo how am I suppose to have my Rights and Freedoms, My right to a fair trial etc... All my Human Rights have been taken away. I can't obtain any help and when I email his lawyer with the fact he is committing fraud his lawyer refuses to respond. His lawyer has a duty of care but because I'm self represented they just ignore me. I don't have any court orders with signatures or seals because they won't give me one.\n\nANYHELP ON WHAT TO DO. I NEED TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE PUTS ME IN A SHELTER. AN EMERGENCY MOTION NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT ASAP TO STOP THIS. I HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND PROOF REQUIRED BUT NO LAW FIRM WILL HELP.\n\nI guess its true what they say, lawyers only care about money. None of them actually care about what they took an oath for, to stand up for the law and help people. They are all too afraid to stand up for what is right??? I need someone who will blow the shit off that corrupt courthouse and their corrupt judges!\n\nNone exist I guess!","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/CCW.Group/permalink/10153303195067271/","message":"Scott says we haven't targeted lawyers enough, so I'm picking up the ball.  I thought I'd go on a brief exploration to see if I can find some accessible examples of how lawyers victimize people.  Before I begin, let's recap what we know about lawyers.\n\n#1:  A law degree is an ARTS degree (like Gender Studies, or Philosophy) - and like Gender Studies and Philosophy, there is no requirement for actual knowledge or skill.  It only requires \"belief\".  As we know, all belief is evil.  Therefore these fields of study are evil, and lawyers, by their very nature, are evil.  Every single one of them is in this category.  There are no exceptions to this rule.\n\n#2:  A lawyer's oath is to THE LAW SOCIETY.  It is, and always will be, their primary obligation.  Their only obligation to their \"clients\" is to maintain their integrity, until all the new money generated by their case has been paid out.\n\n#3:  Fees to a lawyer are only part of what they get paid.  Every time they submit a document to the court with the ATTORNEY GENERAL as TRUSTEE, and that document has one signature on it, they are sending a BILL.  If the document has two signatures and a TRUSTEE (ATTORNEY GENERAL), it is a BILL OF EXCHANGE.  Think about it.  LEGALLY, that's all it can be, and when dealing with lawyers, LEGAL is all that matters.  Lawyers will always try to pretend they are using the common definition of words, instead of the LEGAL definition of words.  \n\n#4:  Win or lose, the lawyer gets paid.  They have no incentive either way.  In JURISDICTIONS like ONTARIO where the loser pays, it doesn't apply to the lawyer.  Losing a case has absolutely no economic effect, or any other effect, on a lawyer.  There are no lawyers that \"care\" about any cause you have hired them for.  There never has been, and there never will be, despite what television tells you.  \n\nIt didn't take me long to find this particular victim.  She's effectively \"down the hall\" in Vernon Beck's \"Canada Court Watch\" group.  Unfortunately Vernon Beck is one of these poor, deluded souls, that thinks the system can be fixed from the inside; and he's always \"making progress\" while entire years of interaction with children are being robbed from people.  Scott has apparently explained to him that at no time in history, has \"fix it from the inside\" ever worked.  Reading the group, you can see Vernon clearly thinks strangers in dresses, and magic parchments, still have \"authority\".  He'll be on his death bed before he realizes any of us are correct....but this post isn't about him.  This is about a poor woman who's being led down the proverbial garden path by a lawyer, and she's just coming to an ugly realization.   She's pleading for help - where there is none - and it's a heartbreaking read, so be warned.\nThen remember the thousands of people who participate in this, every single one of them believing it's their right to do so...because a lawyer said it to them.\n\nIf you think Scott's position, that it is is morally and ethically sound to cut out the eyes, and cut off the thumbs of lawyers, is over the top, I can guarantee you that this woman disagrees.  And, she was one of those who could afford a lawyer.  Try to imagine the children's lives that are ruined by lawyers coming after those that can't afford a lawyer; because there's certainly a heavy financial incentive to do so, especially for the government.  In the end, LEGAL is just the law of ACCOUNTING and SURETY.   Pretending it's anything other than that, is the first lie lawyers try to see you.  They don't want you to know this, and they'd really prefer it if you were credulous and believed in magic sky-daddies, because then they can leverage that ARTS degree in lying, and you're likely to believe it.  \n\nRead this woman's story and tell me Scott Duncan's views on lawyers are \"extreme\".
