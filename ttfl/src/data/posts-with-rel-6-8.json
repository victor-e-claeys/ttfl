For the purposes of this article, there are no purported \"gurus\" in this forum, Christians believe they have an invisible companion, and money is a TENDER FOR LAW.  On a personal note, theists could, I suppose, park their imaginary friends at the door, but as the saying goes, \"If you believe that, you'll buy these shoes\".  That level of credulity, which by its very nature permeates every aspect of your existence, simply does not coexist well with critical thought.\n\nAlthough all of these things are connected, only one of these things interests me today - money as LEGAL TENDER.  I'm really confused as to why this concept seems so difficult to the average person.  Our lives revolve around the concept of tenders.  \n\nBasically, a tender is an offer that can be accepted or rejected.\n\nFrom childhood, we put out tenders for affection, acceptance, or stuff, to our parents and strangers, by being cute, or funny, or disingenous.  If the \"cuteness\" is accepted we may get affection, candy or a new bike.  In this system we are subject to the whims of these adults, their oversight and their rules.\n\nIn adulthood we continue to put out tenders for affection, financial or material gain, and even copulation.  Here too we have made the transition to bigger acceptance and better toys, and are now subject to larger oversight and different rules.\n\nIf someone \"offers\" you a flower on the street, you'd better believe it's a tender for pointless conversation or a \"charitable donation\".\n\nIf you're a woman sitting alone in a bar and someone sidles up to you and offers to buy you a drink, what you're really dealing with is a TENDER for SEX.  In this country at least, there are penalties for simply forcing yourself on another person.  You can, however, raise a tender with dinner, a drink, a fur coat, or a trip to Disneyland; and few people are ultimately confused at the expected outcome.\n\nWhy then should the concept of LEGAL TENDER be so obtuse?  Money is something you don't own, and didn't make.  In fact you can't make it - it's a closed system.  You can possess it or use it (see debt in transit), but only if you observe the terms and conditions set by others (not you again) for its use.  The fact that everyone uses and values it, doesn't make availing yourself of this luxury any less a tender.  If you \"owned\" the money you could set your own terms and conditions for its use.  As you don't, the terms and conditions are set by other controlling entities.  By using others' property you agree to be bound by certain rights and obligations - why else would you be participating in this system?  The use of institutionalized money benefits you when you colour inside the lines, and makes you accountable for non-performance when you don't.  There is, in fact, a fairly mature and far-reaching web of systems all working in concert to reward or punish depending on the profit you generate, and how well, or poorly, you perform.\n\nLet's look at a practical example.  If I have a car, and I let you use it, I might tell you that it must be returned in pristine condition, or with a full tank of gas.  Those are just some of the terms I might set.  I might tell you to pick up my aunt Flora at the doctor's office as well.  If you agree to the stipulations I have set, you can accept the loan of the car.  Let's say you forget to collect aunt Flora, and return the car on empty with garbage in the back seat.  I might be angry, I might want you to pay for cleaning the car, or I might send burly men to beat you up.  The only sure thing is that it's probably the last time I'll loan you the car.\n\nUsing conventional money has benefits, no doubt about it.  It's more convenient than working directly for food or shelter, and more socially acceptable than bringing a chicken or pig to exchange for a new outfit.

I have a lot to say about him, I was in Sweden when he actually asked to call me all the way from his expensive little penthouse in Toronto to sniff me out, let me digress and say that I guess because I am trustworthy, people tend to confide spontaneously, I don t ask questions, I find it rude....anyways, before this Scott flipped out on me 2 days later, the first phone call he called overseas at his own expense, we must have talked 40 mn, then he asked me to get skype ( I did and uninstalled it after the blow out and incidentally it had scrambled the PC I was in so bad I had to let a friend remote fix from the US, and even for her using logmein, and her expertise as an ex US force repair tech for PC circuitry outer space in orbit for their special satellites....she is retired, in the process she just about got her PC all fucked up too, the creep must have done soemthing, he is a PC programmer or something in those lines, besides his legal shit. Anyways, what I found out about him, is for one he is hiding behind a shady trust calles aquilae trust, in it was then Dean Clifford and Andrew Langevin, I saw andrew enter the penthouse on day two, on skype....the other thing is he told me they had 10K in the trust to take down Robert Menard....then that his goal is to re-instate the trust of the Monarchy, when I asked which Monarchy, he said Elizabeth, and went on on how of a hottie she used to be and how she upholds the Common Law, ok well technically I guess, but then he got on my case, giving me shit for all the notices I sent, I sent only 2, one to the receiver general saying I was voiding all my contracts, sin, citizenship and all, and why....( that part for a later conversation, or go to my about page and you will eventually find it ) the other was a 10 day notice, about me giving allegience to God, I dropped that one on the shores of the NSA, on a public board they admiister. Well Scott started flipping on me about God, and how tired he is of all these people with uimaginary friends etc, and when I started taking his argument down, he outright started calling me a cunt and screaming I just said goodbye and hang up on him. I knew them I was onto something, who the hell would call Sweden for 40 mn other than a high level rat. So I blocked him on FB, I blocked Andrew and Dean as well, Mika has kept Andrew on his list. I have warned Robert about this, now I am telling you, and I agree with you they are terrified of God, but I do have genuine atheist friends who threw the baby with the bath water, because of their hate for the hateful things religions have and are doing in the name of God, and I can t blame them, if they only knew they just threw the emergency exist key away, but hey there is not much I can do about it, most of them couldn t be bothered finding out their rights anyways, and I am tired of wasting my saliva, but yeah Mika is interesting, but when I look at his face type when his hair is short, he looks awfully like the special marching platoon of the rc's on Canada day and remembreance day....they all looked like clones when I saw them march in Duncan BC once, I couldn t beleive they had found so many men with the same skull structure, the lions with wide cheeckbones big heads, all sporting the mean look of vengence, strange parade that was. For the longest I used to admire Mika for at least speaking his mind, one day via Andrew the Greek fellow from Montreal who was in phone contact with me in 2012 and had Mika at his cousin s place for a bit, a visit that didn t end well, anyways I got to hear Mika's voice on the phone, and it wasn t anything I expected, it didn t fit the image, I could feel a lot of vanity in it, or something I can t really put a finger on, but although a nice voice, selfishness ? not sure wat it was, but love wasn t what I felt, we'll watch and see, good meeting you and John Spirit.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"536480436387893","comment_count":0,"created_time":1373756265000,"message":"Oh yes, Pierre!

You still get Nazis, so there's that.\n\nJust because they don't feel like following the rules, doesn't mean we have to be ‚Äúscumbags‚Äù like them.  I listened to all the audio recordings that Dean Kory made of his hearings (time I'll never get back, so you fucking owe me, dude!), and I feel it's important for me to correct a few key points here.\n\nI know all of you get your information from multiple sources, ranging from the Grand-Poobah of the Free-Dumb Movement, Robert Menard, to Dean Clifford, to Winston Strout; and maybe it's just self-aggrandizement, but I like to think I'm the only source that tells you the truth instead of just orbiting it.  As with many things in life there's ‚Äúmore than one way to skin a cat‚Äù.  However, one of the worst things you can do is ‚Äúmix methods‚Äù.\n\nDean Clifford and I are at exact opposite ends of the scale.  Dean's name is Trust property, thus giving the man that you know as Dean Clifford a great number of options the rest of you don't have.  He doesn't use the Trust like a bank machine, he doesn't abuse any of the authority that any Trust title gives him, and he has the personal knowledge that he's not on his own if he has to ‚Äúget the fuck out of Dodge‚Äù.  That's where the consensus ends amoung us.  \n\nDean's teachings on Trust Law are accurate, concise and accessible.  For some reason it's worth it for him to give everything he teaches those qualities.  \n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI'm not a super-genius, and I don't possess any mental powers that you don't.  Any discussion and/or engagement with me starts off with the reality that you ALL THINK WRONG, and YOU ALL VALUE THE WRONG THINGS!  This does not serve you when you are up against reality.\n\nThe sad part is that most of you are too old to change; and as I've demonstrated here in this little forum,   none of you can tell the difference between what's true and what feels good.  I know what you're experiencing.  Whether from Dean, or from myself, the time always comes when you read something that one of us writes and you KNOW that it is true; but you take no further time to understand what is being told to you.\n\nFortunately Dean Kory has provided us a working/living example of what happens when all of the above factors are in play.\n\nThe first obvious mistake that Dean Kory is making is that he is combining what Dean Clifford teaches with what I teach.  For the purposes of this article I'm going to dumb the two positions down so you can make the comparison.\n\nDean Clifford is all about being left alone, and when he's not left alone, he is about calling ‚Äúthem‚Äù to account.  \n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI am descended from the very people that put all of this in place.  Entire stereotypes about Scottish people exist to misdirect.  Most will tell you that Scotsmen are ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, when in reality we are conservative about when we engage in commerce.  You have but to look at England's and Scotland's history to see why this is true.  \n\nThe very name of this group, THE TENDER FOR LAW, is all about that mysterious phrase, ‚ÄúTHIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER‚Äù.  \n\nI'll be the first to admit there are a great number of benefits to be enjoyed in commerce, when everybody plays by the rules.  As I'm sure everyone is sadly aware of, by now; Nobody is playing by the rules anymore. \n\nTrying to ‚Äúfix the system‚Äù, or call them to account in their own system, is simply ‚Äúappealing to your rapist‚Äù.  It baffles me that anyone would think this is sound thinking.\n\n...I digress.\n\nAs I'm in a unique position to ‚Äúfollow the money‚Äù, I can determine who needs to pay the price for the royal screw-over we've been given.  As I type this, a team of system's engineers (and trained monkeys) are preparing for you, the reader, a step-by-step guide for cleaning out every financial institution that touches these shores.  The only price that I ask for this knowledge is that you pass it on to others.  Pay it forward...and get paid at the same time.  Who else offers that shit?\n\nI am many things.  I am prorogued Nobility.  I am a published author.  I am a composer.  Above all...the thing that forms the core of who and what I am, is that I am a computer scientist.  Those who have taken the time to actually listen to me, will recognize many ‚ÄúScott-isms‚Äù; and the phrase ‚ÄúCOMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING‚Äù is repeated almost as often as my Number 1 ‚ÄúScott-ism‚Äù, ‚ÄúTHE MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG.‚Äù  You ignore these two truths at your own peril. \n\n...and reality does not care what you ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù.\n\nThis lengthy preamble is to drive the next point home.  \n\nDO NOT TRY TO COMBINE DEAN'S METHODS WITH MINE.\n\nThere is no remedy in fraud.  There simply isn't.\n\nIn many ways I long for the old days where those who breached the PUBLIC TRUST were hauled into the street and thrown into an angry mob.  Authors have mistakenly used the term, ‚ÄúHanging Judge‚Äù  as a term for a judge imposing strict penalties; but if you look through actual history, and not the crap you were taught in the Public Fool System, ‚ÄúHanging Judge‚Äù refers to a judge who has abused his power and has been hung for the abuse of that trust. He gives sentences he should be hung for; HANGING JUDGE. You never hear the phrase ‚Äúhanging JUSTICE‚Äù ;) This is odd, as there are so many of them. :D  ...I know. Digressing. I get it.\n\nWe don't have Judges any more, in Canada.  A judge traditionally was a trusted individual who could uphold the PUBLIC TRUST.  ‚ÄúWe the people‚Äù no longer get to decide who is worthy of that trust.  People confuse the role of ‚Äújudge‚Äù with the current role of ‚ÄúJUSTICE‚Äù.  It is important to know the distinction.\n\nJUSTICE is actually a ‚Äúdoing-business-as‚Äù name for a Crown Corporation.  It actually says, in the Dunn and Bradstreet listings ‚ÄúGovernment of Ontario Operating as JUSTICE‚Äù.  It has been like that, IN VARIOUS FORMS, since 1982.\n.\n..I'm sorry you missed it.\n\nThat is what you're dealing with, and you have ONE unalienable RIGHT; THE RIGHT NOT TO CONTRACT.  \n\nMy position is a lot closer to that held by Irene Gravenhorst, than it is to Dean Clifford's.\n\nSo, let's cover what Dean Kory is doing wrong! :D\n\nI notice a lot of ‚ÄúClifford-isms‚Äù in what Dean Kory is clearly attempting to say; but all of Dean Clifford's methods depend on what I like to refer to as ‚ÄúClubhouse Rules‚Äù, and every time you do this you're pretending to ‚Äúbe in the club‚Äù.  The natural response to somebody doing this is very similar to the response to somebody saying they know more than I.  In case you haven't noticed I smack them down in the most humiliatingly, and public way possible.  ‚ÄúTheir‚Äù reaction is going to be much the same...we're all human after all.\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE (like the cheese) stands alone.\n\nIt is the only issue you should be concerned about! NOTHING ELSE!\n\nSERIOUSLY! Accepting discussion about anything else, is a FUCKING NEGOTIATION.  All of you are not seeing the forest through the trees.  This is why I say Dean Clifford's position is flawed.  He believes the tree can be pruned to look pretty again, when in reality it needs it's roots burned out, and it's limbs chopped up for one of Sir-Mica's gassifiers! The fucking tree is dead!\n\nUNDERSTAND?\n\nThe tree is dead!  \n\nIt's filled with parasites and rot, and the parasites are trying to keep the illusion of a tree standing.  For the past two years I have been feeding them the rope, at my own expense, and with violence inflicted upon me, so that any argument contrary to my position is immediately nullified.  IT IS/WILL BE, CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE that you are NOT getting what you are entitled to, given the burden of surety you have carried!\n\nUnlike THE MAJORITY of your ‚Äúsources of truth‚Äù:\n\nI'm not one of these people that wants to drive without a licence.  \nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their mortgage.  \nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their taxes.  \nI DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE I FUCKING PROMISED TO!\nI am, however, someone that possesses knowledge and skills that the government finds/found essential to their expansion.  In my youth I gave our erstwhile government a tool, which all of you pay the price for today; and I was rewarded handsomely.  I patted myself on the back, and strutted around, knowing that I was smarter than everyone else, and never once paying attention to the harm I had caused.\n\nIn compliance with an oath I took a long time ago, I must atone for that; and that's the only reason you, the reader, even know that I exist.  \n\nI need to remind you again, that the only reason I'm here, is that I promised to be.\n\nNone of you have value to me.  You're not qualified to.\n\nI have a lot to teach you, and we are barely getting started; but I am not responsible for the shit that goes wrong when you try to take what I teach you (‚ÄúREALITY‚Äù) and you try to jam it into your idiotic, unqualified, belief structure.  As I write that sentence I wonder how many of you have actually pondered that other ‚ÄúScott-ism‚Äù you frequently hear; ‚ÄúALL BELIEF IS EVIL.‚Äù  If you believe something, you will stop questioning it; you will stop investigating it, and you will never ponder if, and why, it's true.\n\nShould you believe something, that just happens to be true, you won't look any further ‚Äì and that's a problem.  \n\nSo I want everyone to keep the following in mind.  All the sources you are investigating tell the truth about the law, but there are pitfalls!\n\nEverything Robert Menard says about the law is true.  It's what he doesn't say that's the lie.  If you want quick confirmation of this simply ask him what, ‚ÄúThis note is legal tender‚Äù means.  If he tells you the truth (he won't), ask him why he's constantly ‚Äúbegging‚Äù for that very same TENDER FOR LAW that contains the ACTS and STATUTES that he claims don't apply to him! THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER is a TENDER FOR LAW. If you BENEFIT, then you have OBLIGATION!\n  \nEverything Dean Clifford says about the law is true, but how he chooses to apply it, is not; because there's still a lot of ‚Äúbelief‚Äù running around in his head.  He still believes he can ‚Äúbeat them at their own game.‚Äù  He will proudly point out their public and blatant violations... His evidence is irrefutable and conclusive. His rights are violated by those TRUSTEES of the PUBLIC, and then he tries to seek remedy from those same trustees! REALLY? \n\n...and then says the remedy, is to go to those very same people and ‚Äúsue‚Äù them..in the very same courts that violated his rights. (What?)  ...Oh that's right, those are DIFFERENT courts, with DIFFERENT\n ‚ÄúDoing business as‚Äù JUSTICES. (WHAT?)  ...well, I'll just let you work out the flaw from there. If you can't, then you are too stupid to be reading this, and you should kill yourself.\n\nFeel free to try it this way. It's NOT ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, but it ignores the fact that those who hold the PUBLIC TRUST, ARE wrong. Another ‚ÄúScott-ism‚Äù is my position that NONE OF YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT FEELS GOOD! Following Dean Clifford's methods WILL drive this point home, so it's not a COMPLETE waste. ;)\n\nWell then...back to Dean Kory.\n\nRumour has it, through the grape vine, that the erstwhile Mr. Kory has been and/or will be, a guest on Global C.R.A.P. Radio, hosted by the redoubtable Tony ‚Äúguy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth‚Äù Butros.  This promises to be an exciting show, and I cannot wait to miss it.  I eagerly anticipate the thrill of not consuming time I'll never get back.  \n\nInstead I'll put something useful here ‚Äì advice for your next court room appearance, Mr. Kory.\n\nWhen you're in the court room dealing with these babbling, sacks-of-shit, learn to use the breaks.  Repeat after me, ‚ÄúI DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS‚Äù.  If they ignore your question, then your next response should be, ‚ÄúOBJECTION.  If the court cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.‚Äù  Keep repeating that, and repeating that, and repeating that...until they answer your fucking question.  \n\nI listen to you in court, Dean Kory, and I picture a girl screaming rape while slipping the condom on the rapist.  I notice the distinct lack of that phrase in ANY of your recordings, so repeat it in your head, ‚ÄúObjection.  If you cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.‚Äù\n\nApply THE TENDER FOR LAW Rule to this.  I choose my words very, very carefully, because I know what they mean.  You, the reader, seem to believe there's a library in your ass, because that's demonstrably where you keep pulling your answer out of.  If you see me using a phrase that should be used in court, the very first thing you should do is follow my rules.  Look up every single word, even, no scratch that, ESPECIALLY, if you THINK you know what the word means.  As the regular reader for THE TENDER FOR LAW will tell you, you most certainly don't.\n\nDean Kory reserves his rights, and then doesn't know what the fuck to do with them; but that's ok, because there are plenty of other people in the court room that know what to do with Dean Kory's rights.  \n\nOne thing Dean Kory should learn is that he is most certainly not Dean Clifford.  Make no mistake, it doesn't matter if I disagree with Dean Clifford's methods.  The fact is, I understand them.  What Dean Clifford is doing is beyond your current level of comprehension.  He is not joking when he says that everything he says and does, is part of a larger plan.  I disagree with Dean Clifford's position and methods, because he pays too high a price for the sake of worthless people; but he's doing it for all of you, and not just for himself.  I will admit statistically, this does skew the numbers in his favour; because in the end, Dean Clifford is like you.  You all think wrong, and value the wrong things.\n\nThe only difference between you and Dean Clifford is that some of the things he values ARE the right things.  \n\nWe are all doing this for different reasons.  \n\nRobert Menard will try to scam you out of every cent you have by telling you the truth...because he thinks you deserve it.  You're the Mafia wife, the enabler, and he rationalizes that he's not taking anything of any value from you.  \n\nDean Clifford sees that you're all asleep, and he values mankind as a whole; but like Mary Croft before him, he's beginning to realize that everyone prefers ‚Äúlucid dreaming‚Äù to actually being awake.  The time he takes pandering to that crowd robs him of time, and returns nothing.  \n\nMy position is blatantly self-centered.  I was born with a title I didn't choose.  I was sold to the government, and warehoused for McMaster University because it turned out I was smarter than everybody...and apparently that's a crime.  When I began to call all parties to account, they spared themselves by making certain promises and offering certain concessions and entitlements, which they no longer honour.  \n\nMy aim is to misbehave.\n\nLike Robert Menard, I want you to suffer for your ignorance, especially if you've come to me before.  I want to wield what I know against those who would dare seek to harm me and those that I care about; because all of you are walking a path now, and none of you realize it's a one-way trip.  You all want your freedom, and my position is, ‚ÄúBe careful what you wish for.‚Äù  \n\nAs you all think wrong, and value the wrong things, so it is unlikely you could possibly know what to do with freedom.  If you find yourself making that one-way trip, through that hole in the fence, remember that on the other side, are people just like me.\n\nAll of you are welcomed to believe whatever makes you feel good.  Martin Sutton's belief, for instance, makes him feel good, and he identifies it as the core of who he is; and all I can think is, ‚ÄúThis is what happens when evil has consumed an extraordinary man.‚Äù\n\nALL belief is evil.  Martin Sutton is incapable of evil, so the belief sits there like a parasite, taking this man's good qualities and giving them to ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù.  \n\nAt this point I can classify Martin Sutton as belief's ‚Äúbest-case-scenario‚Äù.  \n\nBelief is taking not thinking and making a virtue out of it.  \n\nAll of the people from whom you seek knowledge are extraordinary in their own way.  However, reality doesn't care about these things.  \n\nI certainly hope this effort gets Mr. Kory focused on what's important, but the reality is, all of this is a symptom of a much larger problem.\n\nWe're all running out of time.  I don't know if anyone has noticed the professional name-callers have been labeling people who point out the truth as ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù, while at the same time publishing the inane babbling of actual conspiracy theorists.  This method is much like Americans putting people who hire hookers on sex-offender registries, thus removing any distinction between a guy who indulges in a rent-a-fuck-toy experience, and the Scarborough rapist.  Because none of you understand the exponential function, you couldn't see the bell-curve of your rights being whittled away.\n\nBefore I end this article, let's take a little walk through Canadian legal history.\n\nAt this point in legal history, the Criminal Code pretends to be the Common Law remedy, bestowed to an administrative zone of a sole proprietor CORPORATION called Canada...but this wasn't always the case.\n\nI'm going to presume that you don't have knowledge of the Canadian Bill of Rights.  I freely admit this is not a reasonable presumption as Dean Clifford never shuts up about it (I swear that guy jerks off reading it).  \n\nOne of the most protected rights in that bill of rights was Freedom of Speech.  Under the Bill of Rights ‚Äúoffences‚Äù like hate speech, blasphemous libel (yes, that's a criminal code offence ‚Äì look it up), and ‚Äúuttering a death threat‚Äù, would not be possible.  \n\nThe UK Canada Act 1982, better known as ‚ÄúThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms‚Äù,  includes a ‚Äúnotwithstanding‚Äù clause.  This gives the elected representatives of an administrative zone's constituency the power and authority to say, ‚ÄúFuck off, that's just stupid,‚Äù to any Federal Statute.  The closest a province has ever come to using this was on the ‚Äúgay marriage‚Äù issue.  Everyone's entire government had just been privatized, and their biggest concern appeared to be whether two dudes can marry.  \n\nI look at events like this and sometimes I can't help but think, ‚ÄúMaybe Menard's right.  Maybe you do deserve it.‚Äù  \n\nAnyway, while you were all in a tizzy about whether a dude can wear a wedding dress and be taken seriously, other more sinister machinations were afoot.  \n\nHis name is Ernst Z√ºndel of Regina v. Z√ºndel fame, and his story went something like this:\n\nErnst Z√ºndel is one of those ideological pustules on society that invariably erupt when free speech is so vigorously protected.  I've read what Mr. Z√ºndel has to say, and he cites reliable sources to support his position.  This ignores the reality, and other evidence, that counters his position.  \n\nWhat's more reasonable to accept?\n\nThat the holocaust didn't happen?  Or that Roma (gypsies), the mentally ill, the handicapped, the Muslims, the Jews, the homosexuals, and the political dissidents, were all rounded up and exterminated; and the Jews just whined about it the most.  People doing stupid things at ‚Äúcrime scenes‚Äù don't help, and support idiots like Mr. Z√ºndel.  With only a little, tiny bit of probing, you will discover this fun fact regarding the holocaust.  Those smoke-stacks on Auschwitz  were built in 1947 for ‚Äúdramatic effect‚Äù; and when pressured on it, every holocaust memorial foundation grudgingly admits this is true.\n\nBut back to Mr. Z√ºndel....\n\nErnst Z√ºndel was doing the Streisand effect, before Barbara Streisand made it cool. \n\nAfter the constitution was ratified, parliament quickly set about whittling away your free speech rights, and Ernst Z√ºndel happened to be in the right place at the right time.  No one knew it then.\n\nNow Ernst Z√ºndel is a hateful little man; and he wants the world to know it.  So much so, he decided you could avail yourself of his opinion by calling up his ‚Äú976 Hate Speech Hotline‚Äù...for the low, low charge of ten dollars appearing on your phone bill, you could injest all the hate-mongering that would fit on an answering machine tape (Yes, a fucking tape.  That's how long ago this shit happened).  \n\nPeople called up and he actually profited from being a hateful little man...and if the story ended there, you could reasonably think, ‚ÄúFuck this is Canada.  You can do anything‚Äù, and we'd all live happily ever after.  \n\nAfter a couple of months of profiting from people with more money than brains, rumour of this great scam eventually fell on the ears of a Jew.  See?  Mel Gibson was right.  Jews are always causing trouble.  Well it came to pass, that this great scam did fall on the ear of a Jew, and attached to that ear of a Jew, was a Jew with a finger, which could dial a telephone; and for the bargain price of ten bucks...he could make history!\n\nI freely admit that I wouldn't pass that shit up, so there's no way a Jew's going to.  Remember the stereotypes kids, and be advised that Jews come to Scottish people to learn humility.\n\nDo you guys see how many stereotypes I've managed to jam into here so far?\n\nAs the result of this hilarious chain of events, Mr. Z√ºndel became the dubious winner of the ‚ÄúFirst Man to be Charged with Hate Speech‚Äù prize.  Under this ‚Äúcode‚Äù Mr. Z√ºndel's position was indefensible, but he had an ‚Äúace up his sleeve‚Äù.  He had studied the constitution and believed he had the right to do what he did.   His lawyer, probably another Jew, saw dollar signs rocketing all the way to the Supreme Court, so he grabbed onto the Law Society's tit and sucked as hard as he could.  This case plodded through the courts relentlessly, and ended up at the Supreme Court where they freely admitted that all hate speech laws are, by their very nature, unconstitutional.  However, Nazis are ‚Äúbad‚Äù so they decided to remove that right and blatantly ignore anything the constitution has to say, with an addendum pointing out that each administrative zone (province) has the right to exercise that ‚Äúnotwithstanding‚Äù clause nobody's ever dared use.  \n\nThey'll save it for something important...like dudes getting married to each other.  I say dudes because I refuse to accept the proposition that hot girl-on-girl action is NOT a human right.\n\nThese events marked the beginning of the slippery slope of rights removal all of you are just discovering now.  It has been happening for a very long time.  \n\nMuch has happened since the Z√ºndel case.  The public is slowly spoon-fed ridiculous concepts.  The United States slipped even faster using our ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù hate-speech laws as an example.  Now there is a perfectly ‚Äúlegal‚Äù ‚ÄúWar on Terror‚Äù.  Americans are so stupid that they don't even realise they're making war on something that's not even an noun.  ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù at least meets the ‚Äúnoun‚Äù criterion.  If you had to defend the ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù, it's only defense would be, ‚ÄúAt least we're making war on a noun.‚Äù\n\nI'll let that sink in.\n\nHow many stupid ‚ÄúPatriotic Americans‚Äù don't realize there's a war on something that's not even a fucking noun.  If I think you don't deserve to live for not realizing that, imagine how low you rank in the eyes of those who created this policy ‚Äì all \"perfectly legal\".\n\nWe need a Monarch dictator for a generation, to bitch-slap you back to reality.  For, one of the other things that I don't hide, is the fact that I, and other privateers, commissioned the AQUILAE TRUST with the primary mandate: To assist in the restoration of executive power of the Monarchy, under the terms of the AQUILAE COVENANT.\n\nThree generations ago, Princess Elizabeth called to the then recently-released slaves, to help her stop the Empire from being wiped-out by the Germans.  And she is of German descent.  That war left a legacy that is priceless.  It formed the corner stone of civilization and brought us into a new Golden Age.  \n\nThe laws of commerce work when everybody plays by the rules, and when everybody's rights are respected.  For three decades I have screamed that this is not happening.  \n\nSo I have set out to prove it to you.  My goal is to show you all that there is no deception.  They're just not playing by the rules any more.  The people responsible for your chronic ignorance, jumped ship long ago.  Now we're stuck with parrots and chimps, running a mighty, but decaying, infrastructure.\n\nJust remember this is on an exponential curve too.\n\nI am doing my utmost to construct a lifeboat, and to detach you from all this.  What I am constructing (to paraphrase Q from Star Trek) has wonders to satiate all desires, both subtle and gross.  But it's not for the timid.  \n\nHere is my court room position in a nutshell.  \n\nYou do not accept surety ‚Äì EVER.  \n\nStep 1: Reserve all rights.  (get Derek Moran to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\n\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed.  Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS.  If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. \n\nAnything outside of this supports their position that you are ‚Äúplaying‚Äù their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules.  The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.\n\nThink very carefully about this.  If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\n and its rules, you might raise the obvious question, ‚ÄúWhy do you get to move two pieces?‚Äù  If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game.  You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert.  \n\nNovice drivers and expert drivers all have to follow the same rules.  You don't get to ignore rules because you suck at them.  Just as my chess board is not a chess school, the court will not allow the presumption that you being a novice is a lawful excuse.  The only method to extract yourself ‚Äúwith honour‚Äù is to accept responsibility for the mistake in presumption.  They are presuming something wrong...and you are acknowledging it's your fault.  The court must accept this MISTAKE, and your entreaty for forgiveness for the unintended debt created.  The court MUST do this.  \n\nYour name should never come into it.  Your name is but a piece of evidence in a much larger presumption that the court has the right to attach a name derived from a public document, to a living man.  This, of course, is untrue.  The court knows it's not their right.  That's why in the Mary Croft days, the quote ‚Äúliving man‚Äù argument worked.  But these are trimming at the branches of the poisonous tree in an attempt to make it look pretty.  The only solution is to target the root.  The root is accounting and surety; there's no farther to dig down.\n\nYou have all heard the quote, ‚ÄúI am not a number.  I am a free man.‚Äù  This came from the profoundly subversive British television series, The Prisoner, which exposes the Noble Lie in the most blunt and obvious way possible, without using the actual words.  If you take the time and watch this series, you can see very clearly, knowing what you know so far, exactly how everything is.  The protagonist, played by Patrick McGoohan, who truly supports the concept that acting is an art form, is only ever identified as ‚ÄúNumber 6‚Äù.  The highest ranking officer in the prison is only ‚ÄúNumber 2‚Äù, whose character keeps changing; none of them ever answering the constantly-posed question, ‚ÄúWho is 'Number ONE'?‚Äù  \n\nAnd...because I fucking-love giving away the ending...\n\n‚ÄúNumber ONE‚Äù turns out to be a delusion of the protagonist's own making, whom others around him exploited; all to answer the question, ‚ÄúWhy did you resign?‚Äù  I want you to think about that as you go down this path.  \n\nYou will be pursued by the people you once served, and you will be asked, ‚ÄúWhy did you resign?‚Äù  To answer is to become ‚Äúsalvage‚Äù.  You never learned why ‚ÄúNumber 6‚Äù ‚Äúresigned‚Äù, because his position is what your position should be as regards government.\n\nNONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS!  \n\nIf you want to be even more hostile reach for a ‚ÄúScott-ism‚Äù, FOR WHATEVER REASON OFFENDS YOU THE MOST!\n\nSo there's your homework.  Read this article over, and over, and over again.  Just so there's no confusion, I am communicating on several levels here.  Whoever is reading this, pay close attention to what I say.\n\nThat's it.

(and smiling like an idiot)\n\nGuess who very recently arranged to have an LLC organized in Delaware? ;)\n\nWarning: This is likely one of the longer posts ever submitted/posted here at THE TENDER FOR LAW and will almost certainly be the longest post I will ever make/submit.\n\nMy head is spinning at all the legal possibilities. They seem endless almost. \n\nI have many questions and have to go revisit/find some old threads so I'm not too much of a pain/shit smearer, but I thought I'd post this and a few questions and \"curious\" observations for now.\n\nMy main goal/objective is to create an AFTER document, with the document provide below as the BEFORE document. My hope is that as a group we can together transform this very ordinary and average template (an average boat not much better than a dingy) and using what we have learned here, transform it into a thing of beauty - a magnificent rough ocean worthy \"battleship\" capable of taking on the most formidable opponents and coming out on top.\n\nI'm thinking it might be a good idea to create two kinds of members. Some with more \"rights\" than others (such as voting rights) so as to protect the company from sharks that may get on board. I'd like one of my person to have the power to toss anyone overboard that might endanger the sheep or attempt to steer it in a direction I don't approve of. I want to be the ADMIRAL and make sure I remain the Admiral as long as I want to be. [Yet some of those things seem to conflict with my ethics/or programming (unsure which in some cases)].\n\n******\n\nI humbly suggest it could be FUN FOR EVERYONE and a great way for the newbies to put together the gold nuggets and help them get rid of a bit of the confused look they likely have on their faces all day long.\n\nI know it is a lot of work, but think of all the fun we can have while doing it. :)\n\n******\n\nThe Scoop:\n\nI hired a corporation down there to assist me with the process.\n\nAn AGENT of theirs submitted an application indicating the INTENT to be an ORGANIZER of an LLC in the STATE OF DELAWARE and provided A NAME for the new PERSON to be created. FIAT currency was given to pay FEES. \n\nThe SECRETARY OF STATE then IDENTIFIED the AGENT as the ORGANIZER of the LLC and provided the ORGANIZER a CERTIFICATE OF FORMATION from the SECRETARY OF STATE. It has two numbers, a FILE NUMBER and another number with SR in front of it. (? guessing State Registration) :/\n\nIt appears that the very next thing that the AGENT did was CREATE SOME LAWS. :) They sat at their computer and typed out a few of them (most likely a template) in a document they created and titled INITIAL RESOLUTIONS wherein her PERSON OPERATING AS an ORGANIZER of the LLC indicated her wish to RESOLVE some things. \n\nBUT, before those things could be resolved, as the ORGANIZER with SIGNING AUTHORITY, her PERSON had to state that she wanted to ADOPT a few things - these things called RESOLUTIONS.\n\nSo, then her PERSON resolved to RELINQUISH SIGNING AUTHORITY to the MANAGERS LISTED. Then this ORGANIZER resolved to name names and named me MANAGER of the LLC and signed this LEGAL document that stated that my PERSON will SERVE as MANAGER. (Isn't that nice of PERSON?) BUT, there is a catch, my PERSON will only SERVE as MANAGER until \"the Members(s) vote otherwise.\n\nHere's the other things this organizer RESOLVED in this one page legal document with a whole bunch of LAW in it that the ORGANIZER just made up.\n\n2) The DATE, the STATE, the ASSIGNED filing number.\n3) That the COPY of the ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION is COMPLETE.\n4) That the general PROVISIONS of an OPERATING AGREEMENT be ADOPTED and included as OFFICIAL RECORDS of the LLC. If the MEMBERS choose to adopt a more detailed operating agreement, then it will take precedence \nover general provisions in the ORIGINAL operating agreement.\n5) The MEMBERS have formed (not my person which hired the agent/organizer-not me ACTING as a PERSON/MANAGER of the LLC) the LLC, and (get this) THEY (still not one of MY PERSONS :/) are ENTITLED (ooh that sounds like someone who is privileged) to the FULL EXTENT OF THEIR LIMITED LIABILITY pursuant to State Law. (Somebody who has never lied to me told me that Delaware would be his choice if he were going to start an LLC because it's the best place IN THE WORLD if you enjoy LIMITED LIABILITY and want a lot of it)\n\nAnd talk about LIMITED LIABILITY, #5 goes on to say that even if the MEMBERS (utterly and completely) FAIL to MAINTAIN FORMALITIES of an LLC they are still entitled to all the LL anyways (isn't that nice). \n\nSo I guess that if a MEMBER gets some maple bacon grease on some documents, or loses some, or has to use some important documents to wipe their ass with because they run out of toilet paper, it's not a problem as far as the STATE of Delaware is concerned. \n\nMy person also received a blank template entitled LISTING OF MANAGERS and another template (i'll post a pic of it when I get a chance), namely a LLC MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE. \n\nIt looks like it's printed on that stuff that is often referred to as \"BOND PAPER\" and, to be valid, and, or, complete, it requires signatures in a few places by people with different TITLES. \n\nIt also appears to me that even though this CERTIFICATE looks like a MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE, it's not a MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE until the LLC CAUSES (\"caused this certificate\") \"to be EXECUTED by its MEMBERS\", or it can be BOTH a MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE and a SHARE (until it's cut along a provided dotted line).\n\nHere's where I am a still confused (i am likely being an idiot), as far as I can tell, the LLC doesn't have any members yet. It had an organizer who resolved to name me a MANAGER with signing authority. But no MEMBERS in sight anywhere. \n\nI guess my person had better MANAGE this since it's the manager of this \"MANAGER MANAGED\" LLC. \n\nFor clarification, the top portion of this certificate seems to require the following fields filled out:\n\nLLC NAME, Where it was organized, Total amount of members at X date, What PERSON is (is being) CERTIFIED to be a MEMBER,\nWhat % of INTEREST they HOLD (stating that they are ENTITLED to FULL BENEFITS of such memberSHIP), Date, and two final fields : Named Member and witness AND/OR member\n\n(not sure if it is noteworthy but the title of the final fields is exactly as written - i capped the AND/OR - with a capital N and M while the other field employed a lower case w and lowercase m)\n\nI see that the witness and/or member must sign, and I conclude for now that the Named Member field does not require the new members signature, but should be written in all caps. It could be another LLC person after all.\n\nHere's my first question, and if it's any consolation I feel stupid asking it... What MEMBERS are there that could cause another member to be named? It seems like the chicken and an egg riddle. \n\nAs a Manager, I need to find some \"members\" to EXECUTE this certificate so the LLC can get its very FIRST member. \n\nI'm guessing that since I now have signing authority as the Manager, that I can now create a RESOLUTION resolving to make my PERSON be known, identified, recognized as a MEMBER and/or MEMBERS, print my PERSONS name in the second last field (Named Member) and sign the last field as a \"member\", or get someone else to sign it as a witness. I'm probably complicating things here and need one of those zen ruler swats in the head. :/\n\nEnough of me blabbing...here is my little dingy they sent my person that was just put in the seas of commerce on the shores of Delaware...\n\n***************\n\nLIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OPERATING AGREEMENT\n\nThis Company Agreement of this MANAGER MANAGED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY organized pursuant to applicable state law, is entered into and shall become effective as of the Effective Date by and among the Company and the persons executing this Agreement as Members.

At this point exiting member may not make this intention publicly known. If such other Members decline or fail to elect such interest within sixty (60) days, the exiting member may advertise its membership interest for sale as it sees fit. \n(b) If a member has a buyer of member‚Äôs interest, the other current member(s) have first right of refusal to purchase the exiting members interest for the agreed purchase price. If there are more than one current remaining members, remaining members may combine funds to purchase the exiting members interest. Exiting member must show that potential purchaser has full certified funds, or the ability to get full certified funds before the first right of refusal period starts. Current members have 60 days to buy exiting members interest if they so desire. \n(c) Pursuant to the applicable law, current members may unanimously approve the sale of exiting members‚Äô interests to grant full membership benefits and functionality to the new member. The current remaining members must unanimously approve the sale, or the purchaser or assignee will have no right to participate in the management of the business, affairs of the Company, or member voting rights. The purchaser or assignee shall only be entitled to receive the share of the profits or other compensation by way of income and the return of contributions to which that Member would otherwise be entitled. Exiting member must disclose to buyer or assignee if current members will not approve the sale. \n7.2\nVALUATION OF EXITING MEMBERS INTEREST. If a member wants to exit the LLC, and does not have a buyer of its membership interest, exiting member will assign its interest to current members according to the following set forth procedures:\n(a) A value must be placed upon this membership interest before assigned. \n(b) If exiting member and current members do not agree on the value of this membership interest, exiting member must pay for a certified appraiser to appraise the LLC company value, and the exiting members‚Äô value will be assigned a value according to the exiting members‚Äô interest percentage. \n(c) The current members must approve the certified appraiser used by exiting member. Current members have 30 days to approve the exiting members certified appraiser. If current members disapprove the certified appraiser, they must show evidence to support their disapproval of the certified appraiser as a vendor qualified to make the LLC business appraisal. Current members may not stall the process by disapproving all certified appraisers. \n(d) Upon completion of a certified appraiser placing a value on the LLC, a value will be placed on exiting members‚Äô interest according to exiting members‚Äô percentage of membership interest. \n(e) If current members disagree with the value placed on exiting members‚Äô interest, current members must pay for a certified appraiser to value the LLC and exiting members‚Äô interest according to the same terms. \n(f) Current members‚Äô appraiser must be completed within 60 days or right of current members to dispute the value of exiting members interest expires. \n(g) Upon completion of current members certified appraiser, the exiting member must approve the value placed on exiting members‚Äô interest. Exiting member has 30 days to approve this value. \n(h) If exiting member does not approve current members‚Äô appraiser value, the value of the LLC will be determined by adding both parties‚Äô values, then dividing that value in half, then creating the value of the exiting members‚Äô interest according to the exiting members‚Äô percentage of membership interest. \n7.3\nDISTRIBUTION OF EXITING MEMBERS INTEREST. Upon determination of exiting members‚Äô interest value, the value will be a debt of the LLC. The exiting member will only be able to demand payment of this debt at dissolution of the LLC or the following method:\n(a) LLC will make timely payments. \n(b) LLC will only be required to make payments towards exiting members‚Äô debt if LLC is profitable and passed income to current members. \n(c) LLC must make a debt payment to exiting member if LLC passed income of 50% of the total determined value of the exiting members‚Äô interest in one taxable year. \n(Example: If exiting members‚Äô value was $100,000 and current member(s) received $50,000 taxable income in the taxable year, the LLC would owe a debt payment to exiting member. If current member(s) only received $90,000 in passed income, there would be no payment due.) \n(d) Debt payment must be at least 10% of the value of the passed income to current LLC members. \n(e) LLC must make payment to exiting member within 60 days of the end of the taxable year for the LLC. \n(f) Payment schedule will continue until exiting member‚Äôs debt is paid by LLC. \n(g) If LLC dissolves, exiting member will be a regular debtor and payment will follow normal LLC dissolution payment statutes. \n(h) Exiting members‚Äô value of membership interest it assigned current members may NOT accrue interest. \n(i) LLC can pay off amount owed to exiting member at any time if it so desires.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"1031162120253053","comment_count":0,"created_time":1468527134000,"message":"Don't say I didn't warn you! ;)"},{"id":"1031257180243547","comment_count":0,"created_time":1468539627000,"message":"I can turn it into a one line proposition. :D...\n\nLet's fix this and everyone can benefit and learn.

I have to tell you, it's not going to let up in this article, because this article is about INSURANCE.  We all know about INSURANCE.  If you're driving, you HAVE to have INSURANCE.  Hell if you want safe harbour anywhere, the harbour-master will demand that your boat have INSURANCE.\n\nSo let's look at the word.  First the prefix \"in\".  What does the prefix \"in\" mean?  Well, look at all the words that I use to describe all of you - Inept, incompetent, incapable, insecure, insincere, indefensible, inexcusable, ineffective...I'm sure you guys are getting the idea.  And the rest of the word just refers to surety.  In the end it all refers to surety and accounting -- nothing else.\n\nIn order to completely remove surety (insure), another PERSON must take responsibility (SURETY) for your actions.  This concept is in fact, FRAUD.  Here in reality it's not what you know, it's what you can prove.  I've leveraged that concept all my life.  Let's assume as I type this, I KNOW I am responsible for at least three homicides; but can you prove it?  Let's say you could.  What if you decided I committed those homicides for the right reasons, and you decided that you were going to \"do the time\" for me.  And while I certainly don't want to discourage people from doing really nice things for me, you serving the sentence for me does not actually absolve me of the responsibility.  You're just taking the proverbial \"hit\" for me.  Allowing you to do that time for me would be unethical in ways I won't even cover here, yet that morally repugnant concept is played out daily - with INSURANCE.\n\nAnother PERSON assumes SURETY for your actions.  This is why INSURANCE companies still refer to natural events/disasters as \"Acts of God\".  A delusional Christian fuck-wit brings this up weekly as though their INSURANCE policy validates the existence of God.\n\nThis is one of many uses for the Abrahamic religions.  They socially-engineer concepts like INSURANCE so they are elevated from blatant unethical FRAUD to a necessity for daily life, and they will say you are foolish, or a bad person, for not having INSURANCE.\n\nHow did they manage to pull that off?  In my above homicide scenario, I explained the FRAUD in plain, unambiguous terms.  Only the most ethically bankrupt amongst you will miss the point.  The reason it has never occurred to you, is because of everybody's favourite zombie-rape-baby, Jesus H. Christ.  \n\nAs a little side note to Christians, as it may not have occurred to them, it's NOT OK to impregnate women in their sleep!  This should seem obvious but you're a Christian -- so you can never be too sure.\n\nAnyway...where was I? ...Jesus the zombie-rape-baby...right.\n\nThe whole Christian doctrine revolves around the assertion that Jesus-zombie-rape-baby died for your sins.  Only Christians seem to be able to determine what these \"sins\" are; however, apparently having sex is a sin, and murder is a sin; hell, even thought crimes (impure thoughts) are sins.  But don't you worry, you horrible, wretched thing, Jesus the zombie-rape-baby has died for your sins.  And if you can believe that, well then, Bob's Universal All-encompassing mega INSURANCE policy (don't forget to read the fine print) is for you (Act now, 'cause you know we can't do this all day)!  \n\nOne of the things all of you have to realize, especially the Christians, is that the entire history of the world was rewritten in the 1500's.  Shakespeare was introduced to inject \"legalese\" into the vernacular of the Angols.  Translate any copy of THE MAGNA CARTA and you will notice no legalese ever appears in it.  And my personal favourite is Christians that wave around the KING JAMES BIBLE.  I can't make this any simpler.  It says right on the fucking cover who is scamming you!  \n\nEverything in the nobility is executed by APPOINTMENT, from social engineering projects like the KING JAMES BIBLE, to Dunhill cigarettes, because the Queen likes a certain type of tobacco.  These products and \"services\" are executed with the presumption that they are in compliance with the Sovereign's wishes, and notice is given on the product itself that it was created by APPOINTMENT, by the entity who appointed it.\n\nThe KING JAMES BIBLE was APPOINTED by King James.  The technology had reached the point were mass production of print medium was possible.  This meant that social engineering that normally relied on \"word-of-mouth\" could now have rigid change-control introduced.  This meant the instructions for selling your daughter into slavery was consistent throughout the Commonwealth.  This also introduced the concept of an imaginary rape baby taking responsibility for all the bad shit you do.  Seriously that's what you \"bought\".  There are people reading this who believe this to be true.  \n\nThe whole \"dying\" thing is also a scam.  That's the zombie part.  Zombie-rape-baby-Jesus supposedly came back to life three day's after he died.  Where's the sacrifice?  He wasn't even out of commission long enough for his relatives to start fighting over his stuff.  The very notion that \"Jesus died for your sins\" is nullified by the fact that he stopped being dead.  He didn't die for your sins, he had a bad weekend for your sins...and he slept through most of it.  OK, I'm really Christian-bashing here.  Let's split the difference and say, \"Jesus was sightly inconvenienced for your sins.\"\n\nI understand he was inconvenienced on a long weekend, too, which makes it really...bad?\n\nI'm sorry, I'm really trying to ascertain how this equals all the bad shit you do.  You Christians will claim this Jesus guy will absolve me of any wrongdoing because of the \"sacrifice\" he made, but I'm not seeing where this sacrifice is.  I'm not mentioning this because I'm looking for convincing.  I'm from that same group of guys that made this book, and that's where the argument becomes moot.  \n\nI can't stress this enough, but I'm one of the guys that's in on the scam.\n\nYou'll constantly hear me say, \"Stop studying the clubhouse rules, because you're not in the club.\"  I'm descended from the founders of the club.  I would rather live in poverty than to live off your labour; although my position on this has been on a sliding scale of late.  Of all the clubhouse rules, the bible in any form, should be avoided at all costs.  It should be fought at every possible opportunity, and should be met with all the ridicule and contempt you can throw at it...\n\n...because it deserves no less.  It is an ethically bankrupt FRAUD...just like INSURANCE.\n\nIf you think I can make Christianity sound retarded, wait until I cover INSURANCE.  \n\nSo let's zoom back to when you were 16-years-old.  You can't vote, you can't drink, there's a question mark as to whether you can legally have sex according to where you reside, but there is one thing you can do -- you can drive.\n\nHence you engage in the ego-building act of getting \"permission to learn\" from the government.  So, at the whim of a paper-pusher who couldn't get a job in the real world, you will hopefully be given permission to learn; and you will have proof that you have this permission when you produce a LEARNER'S PERMIT.  And so every good Christian goes through this RIGHT OF PASSAGE where they are granted permission to learn.  Gee willikers, it's awfully swell that the government gave you permission to learn, huh?\n\nBut you're just sixteen, remember?  You're not old enough to know of the real pitfalls of life...like dames and broads trying to play you for a sap (I'm laughing as I type this, because 1950's movie-speak is almost as retarded as this generations's pop-culture slang).  \n\nNow in order to exercise your newly-acquired \"permission to learn\" you're going to need a vehicle, perhaps a car, which is a contraction of carriage...which is a LEGAL term, so don't use it.  But since you're trying to be \"LEGAL\", having been granted \"permission to learn\" (seriously am I the only one who finds that the most demeaning thing ever written on paper?), a car will do just nicely.  But what if you get into an accident?  It won't occur to you that accident is just that - an accident.  There is no SURETY, real or implied, for something that's accidental.  That's what makes it an accident!  There is no intent behind the damage.  But if you subjugate yourself to a PERSON, that PERSON will assume full SURETY for any damages, and like zombie-rape-baby-Jesus, this PERSON only exists on paper.  All of you consider it so real, that people are jailed regularly for \"Driving without INSURANCE\".  It sort of \"drives\" the point home, doesn't it?\n\nYou have been pre-programmed to accept this subjugation, this ridiculous, FRAUDULENT, morally-bankrupt subjugation is a LEGAL necessity, and all of it deals with MONEY OF ACCOUNT.  MONEY OF EXCHANGE never touches the equation.  For those of you who are too lazy and/or stupid to learn the difference between MONEY OF ACCOUNT and MONEY OF EXCHANGE, one dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT is only capable of buying and/or cancelling another dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT.  90% of all money in the world is this type of money.  It's pretend.  It's not real.  It only applies to the clubhouse rules, and it competes directly with the money in your pocket.  This is the dynamic that everyone misses.  \n\nI hear lots of extremely accurate descriptions of how MONEY OF ACCOUNT is created, and they all come from idiots who know nothing about what money is.  They'll go off on some tangent about Lou Manotti and his evil henchmen, the Freemasons.  ...and lizards. There's lizards somewhere in all of their crap, too.\n\nOnce again I'd like to digress and remind everyone that on every occasion that I required a mason, free did not enter into the equation.  Masons are fucking expensive, and there's no such thing as a free one.\n\n...where was i?\n\nAh yes...MONEY OF ACCOUNT versus MONEY OF EXCHANGE.\n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW is primarily about the money that carries that TENDER.  There are lots of learned men who will talk endlessly about law.  I have forgotten more about law than all of these men combined have ever learned.  I say men because a woman's brain simply would not be able to encompass the blatant lies that the travesty that we call law spews at them.  Reading the writings of Mary Elizabeth Croft will provide you with one example of what goes through a thinking-woman's mind when law is actually analyzed.  You'll notice the things I teach you here from a law perspective, are really simple.  They are all created with the intent of getting you out of accounting and surety.  I have declared publicly on the record that the TENDER FOR LAW that money provides is, in fact, a FRAUD.  Most of you reading this are probably already painfully aware of this fact.\n\nMy entire life plan relied on the RULE OF LAW remaining intact, but when the time came for me to assert my RIGHTS under that rule, the pretence became blatant.  Anyone else going through what I have, would have been defeated; but as I constantly point out, I'm descended from an evil, vile, pseudo-culture...and I've forgotten more about law than any of these people will ever know.  There are lawyers that will testify to that fact, so it's not like this should come as a surprise, but I have documented EVERYTHING.  If it was spoken as regards me, I have a recording of it.  If any name over which I have executive authority has been used in a document, I have a copy of it.  Laid out on a time-line, the blatant FRAUD becomes irrefutable, conclusive proof of what everybody already knows.  \n\nI mention all this because what I'm describing is, INSURANCE.  Notice that my INSURANCE is a little different than the good neighbours at, \"State Farm\".  It's designed to put the SURETY where it belongs -- not with me.  The difference between the good neighbours at State Farm and me, is that I am not subjugating myself.  My INSURANCE is real.  It exists in the real world, and the more astute among you will see that I am pushing it all into a universe of virtual worlds.\n\nWhen you understand what money is, you can construct money through VALUE.\n\nIf it exists in the real world, it has VALUE.  Any currency used to track that VALUE, when exchanging goods, is MONEY OF EXCHANGE.  \n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, does not exist in the real world.  Only its mysterious creators have any COPYHOLD on the VALUE.  That's the thing about Bitcoin - in the end the guys that created it, get all the money.  They get this because people volunteer to take alpha-test-grade, proof-of-concept code, and open their computers up to the Internet.  They then give hardware-level access to their memory, processor, GPU and hard drive, to a rogue, autonomous process that their empty, little heads couldn't even dream of understanding, with no one paying attention to its original intent -- which is to prove that it could be done.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, there are people who are doing this on purpose, because the VALUE is returned almost immediately.  For Bitcoin has all the properties of gold, without the liabilities.  Bitcoin is but one cryptographic currency.  AQUILAE has its own cryptographic currency.  It cannot be counterfeited, and is a near-perfect accounting mechanism.  AQUILAE is not even a PERSON, it's a TRUST.  If a TRUST can have a currency, why can't you?  What I am building for everyone here, is a method to remove the middle-man.  If you have your own currency, you don't need a bank.  If cryptographic currencies can't be counterfeited, then it's trade cannot be regulated.  It remains within the private realm and the ease at which you can convert your currency to MONEY OF EXCHANGE anywhere in the world, is directly proportional to your VALUE.  In the current economic framework, backed by debt-based FIAT currency, the only legitimate path to wealth is to produce, to make something in the real world that didn't exist before.  \n\nLike every dollar in existence, all things of VALUE have a creation date and a death date.  Whatever you produce must be built with that in mind.  For instance, producing a plaque with a cheesy-Jesus slogan on it, actually has VALUE.  Perhaps it has VALUE to its creator, but here in reality, that plaque with the cheesy-Jesus slogan, will find its way to a landfill very quickly.\n\nThis very article you are reading has a creation date, and a death date, and this is becoming apparent with the four threads that just magically disappeared here.  Pierre destroyed the thread where he was bestowed his sacred, native name.  The thread itself had VALUE, for it reflected the culture from whence Pierre came.  The colloquial term, \"fucking the dog\" refers to bored, unionized workers taking their one-hour breaks between their fifteen minutes of actual labour.  Look at any road crew in Quebec and you will see a working example of \"fucking the dog.\"  And so, Fucks the Puppy was bestowed upon Pierre as an homage, and in an irrational fit of nameless rage Pierre destroyed the thread, which by the way, is the most labour I've ever seen out of labourer in Quebec.  Ok, I don't really feel that way about people from Quebec.  Don't quote me on it, but I'm pretty sure there's an act or statute somewhere in Ontario that says I must make fun of people from Quebec.  I'm also pretty sure there's an equivalent act or statute for people in Quebec to refer to people in Ontario.  Truth be told, one of the most inspirational people in my lifetime was Rene Levesque, and I strongly suggest that every single reader look at the history of this awesome shit-disturber.  \n\nQuebec politicians do some awesome things.  For example, if you want to see awesome, political suicide, no one will ever beat Jacques Parizeau...but I digress again...\n\nWe were talking about INSURANCE.\n\nMy INSURANCE is my life plan.  It's way off track, and I need to get it back on track.  But my life plan relied on the Rule of Law remaining intact.  And while we weren't looking, our RIGHTS got sold, and nobody bothered consulting us.  My INSURANCE company went bust.  The Rule of Law is not intact, and in my eyes they have forfeitted the right to exist; because I've made it very clear, that limited liability is a fallacious concept, and if I stand by and watch the GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO operating as \"JUSTICE\", victimize the PUBLIC whose TRUST it holds, I become no better than you.  I have a life plan that I must return to.  I have a defective government process posing as \"JUSTICE\" and victimizing the citizens it has sworn to serve.  \n\nTo return to my life plan under these circumstances is to make myself an enabler; and so I have a problem.  For whether I like it or not, I'm one of the good guys, and it's not a role I'm comfortable with.  There are many reasons for this, one of them being that to be the good guy, I have to do both.  I have to get \"a\" Rule of Law in place, one that serves the interests of the people it governs.  Since I love spewing out spoilers I'm going to give the end of the story away RIGHT NOW!  Why am I destroying your journey of discovery by giving away the ending? Because, FUCK YOU, that's why!  I may be the good guy, but I don't have to be nice about it.\n\nThe only way to LEGALLY and LAWFULLY do what I propose is to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to the Monarchy for a period not exceeding five years.  From this moment forward a primary focus of those who follow what I am teaching should be an investigation into why this is true.  It is the only possible answer that has any chance of success.  Over the next few weeks we will explore why giving executive power to a little old lady of Germanic descent, and nine Corgees, is a good idea.  AND, because I'm right, everybody is going to find out the hard way, that it is impossible to prove that I'm wrong.  That's what makes it right!  \n\nAs I explain, step-by-step, how I intend to accomplish this lofty goal, it will become readily apparent that I already have everything in place.  I've planned for what's to come.  AND, before shit gets real, I'm going to train you all up to a level where you can think in a useful manner.  By useful, I mean to YOU, because you currently think wrong, and VALUE the wrong things.  It may be difficult to hear, but you're programmed to be a useless, sack-of-shit.  If you should produce any VALUE, the government is there to lie to you about that VALUE, and to trick you into thinking you owE THEM for being VALUEable.  If I'm successful, all that stolen VALUE will be returned to the people it was stolen from.  But what happens at the end of that five years? You see Elizabeth Windsor is the KEEPER OF THE TRUST.  You see a little, old lady.  I see an echo of a little girl that the world knew as Princess Elizabeth -- and her plea to the Commonweath to come to her aid.  This is the SOVEREIGN OF THE COMMONWEALTH, and she didn't choose it.  My grandfather taught me all I needed to know to TRUST Elizabeth Windsor.  When the power is handed to her, she'll know what to do with it, because she knows that even if she fails at what is surely a lifetime of planning, she has you and I, as INSURANCE.\n\nWhile this sinks in...

This is true for me too, as it allows me to gauge just how much you are assimilating.  Every once in a while though, a \"gold nugget\" comes up for me.  This is no easy task, and the scarcity of this gold makes it far more valuable to me than it is to you.  The question I reference came up unexpectedly and related to an incredulous observation regarding the product of my three years' of giving actual answers and actual solutions, and telling the actual truth (all of which can be verified by the passage of time).  This erstwhile interrogator asked, \"Why aren't millions of people here?\"  \n\nIt's a fair question.  The very few of you that are here on the Battlefield 2142 card (that's the only way you can become a member), have all witnessed, both personally and externally, the profound truth that I tell.  To be clear, I don't just tell it to complain, nor do I tell it because I want something from you, I actually provide a solution.  It's outside your current scope of experience, but you have to understand the only remedy you will get is through something new...so of course you will have no experience.  That's what makes it new.  Like every pioneering venture - whether it's sailing across the Atlantic to wipe out the Native population with disease, or wiping out the banking system with cryptographic currencies - you must understand the environment you are entering, or you will not survive.  \n\nWe're at a point in our societal \"evolution\" where we can just shrug off the fact that we used guns, germs and steel, to invade a land and kill its people.  You'll forgive me if I have no ethical problem collapsing the banking system and starting a war.  That sounds \"crazy\" when you say it out loud, but if you understand computer science, law and history, you realize that with cryptographic currency it is stupidly easy to collapse the banking system and start a war.  \n\nIn my youth, I was sold to the government and trained for service.  Computer Science is my first love, but they forced the law and history on me.  They were also what taught me that computer science is the answer to everything.  A simple little mental switch changed everything.  With every new thing that I was learning at my young age, I asked myself \"How does this apply to computer science?\".  Any theory I came up with could be immediately tested, and could even be peer-reviewed by another computer scientist.  The irony of events that must come to pass, is that you, the \"good Citizen\" and \"tax payer\", bank-rolled me.  I am your creation.  You did this yourselves, and I'm not the only product of this process.  The first of them are in their mid-fifties now, and are embedded firmly, but quietly, within \"the system\".  Of all the monsters you created I am by far the loudest.  I'm the loudest because I promised to be.  I keep my oaths.  That's another Kool-aid flavour I was forced to drink; but that one sort of stuck...and it has served me, and those I trust, well.  \n\nI survived everything you bank-rolled for me only because I was able to understand, and to adapt, to what is new.  This core motivation is why I've never been scared of technology.  I understand it long before it gets a chance to frighten me.  When I say computer science is the answer to everything, I really mean it.  Law and money are only a tiny piece of the things for which I'm using my knowledge of computer science.  I'm not just talking out of my ass here, I actually show you these things.  The thirty-seven members of THE TENDER FOR LAW are those that are past the \"point of doubt\", and are now being overwhelmed with all the true things they never observed before. I'm writing this because I know how important it is for me to understand it.  Computer science says so, and \"Scott is always right\", because \"the machine\" is never wrong.  Be very careful with that last statement.  None of you reading are qualified to understand the concept that \"the machine is never wrong\".  I accept that you may comprehend the dictionary definitions in that sentence, but you simply don't know enough for that to be real to you.  This means that the only way you could accept that concept is by utilizing the most vile human condition known as \"faith\".  Unfortunately that's not an option you have here.  You simply have to trust what I'm saying is true, and to know that I'll always do my best to substantiate why what I'm saying is true.  You also know that I have to seriously \"dumb myself down\" to even talk to you.  I honestly don't mean that in a condescending way.  I was \"built\" this way - you paid for it.  Unfortunately it's vitally important you do understand what I'm saying is true, and that requires a little work out of you.  This is why many of the original members were filtered out.  You just weren't ready to understand enough.  Some of you are locked in a thought process where you think that if \"you\" can't understand it, than nobody can.  In one of the many Robert Menard \"Public Smack-Downs\", Mr. Menard could not grasp that it was possible for me to produce a YouTube clone in fifteen minutes.  He didn't take the five seconds it would have expended to Google the words, \"YouTube clone\", to confirm that the methodology exists.  He'll simply dismiss it because he can't understand it.  Ironically he'll say the same about me when I dismiss Piece-of-Shit Jesus.  The problem with that argument is that, here in reality, PHP exists, Apache servers exist, and YouTube exists.  Piece-of-Shit Jesus doesn't.  \n\nThose of you trying to understand what I teach, mistakenly think this is a linear progression.  It most certainly is not.  This isn't Grade school, where you go from Grade One to Grade Twelve; this is understanding how to put things together.  The more knowledge and skills you have in the real world, the easier this will be to do.  One of the methods I teach you to learn how to think, is to learn to code.  Computer science may be THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING, but it has absolutely nothing to do with computers.  Computer science forms part of a trinity that makes the computer exist.  The magnificent machine on which you are reading this text, is in the real world, a practical by-product of computer science and sentient thought.  Two insubstantial things: You can't pick them up, you can't see them, they don't make any noise, and they don't emit a smell...but they are most certainly measurable and quantifiable.  This is a quality that Piece-of-Shit Jesus lacks.  Millions, nay billions, believe Piece-of-Shit Jesus is real.  They'll try to make Piece-of-Shit Jesus something substantial by writing a bunch of shit giving Piece-of-Shit Jesus credit for anything good.  \n\nUnfortunately, here in reality, no matter how much you masturbate you're not going to make a baby. \n\nIf it's measurable and quantifiable, it's real.  Computer science, combined with sentient thought, created the magnificent machine you're reading this text on now.  The thing about computer science is that you can learn a lot about the universe with it.  You can literally ask the universe questions, and it will answer back in numbers.  You are reading this text on a machine that's capable of doing that.  And, the thing about trinities is that each piece has to be a strong as the other two, which means they must have the same properties.  Wolfram Alpha and IBM's DEEP LEARNING processes, are the latest wonders to come out of this trinity I just described.  Look at the results.  A computer \"daydreams\".  At this pace we'll understand consciousness in less than a decade.  \n\nOne of the most disturbing things about Piece-of-Shit Christians is how much they claim to \"know\" how God/Jesus thinks/feels, but they fall a little short when you ask them to prove it; followed by the inevitable celebration of ignorance that they call \"faith\".  Billions think that's OK.  This very real thing is what's referred to in the Fermi Paradox as a \"Great Filter\".  Tara has written extensively about these filters, and we mercilessly hammer at them for as long as we can.  It's futile.  I have literally wasted years thinking I could break these filters.  But it has a 100% failure rate.  What started as a labour-of-love for friends and loved ones (at their behest, and according to them, to assist them in leading full and relevant lives), became only a footnote in a larger initiative.  Then why aren't there millions seeking the truths I tell?  They're stuck in the \"Great Filter\".  Our civilization won't survive it.  Computer science says so.  The Machine is never wrong.  Fortunately, everything you need to know about life, you can learn from Star Trek.  The only way to beat the no-win scenario, is to change the conditions of the test.  That was one of the many times Gene Roddenberry profoundly affected me as a man, and I was just a child.  I this case I recall seeing Captain Kirk's son accusing his father of \"cheating\", and his response, \"I changed the conditions of the test.  I don't believe in the no-win scenario\".  I missed the next twenty minutes of the movie as that sunk in.  I've spent a lifetime doing just that, changing the conditions of the test.  \n\nYou get to be a \"colonist\" now.  The conditions of the test are changing as we speak.  By the time the conditions of the test have been changed, you should be well-established, and you will likely do very, very well for yourself.  I'll trust you'll remember how you got that way when I ask to borrow your yacht for a month, with only a vague promise of it returning intact.  \n\nThese great filters are very, very real, and as you learn you will find that there are others ahead.  Elon Musk is terrified of the concept of a self-aware artificial intelligence.  A quick \"Google search\" will show that this is true; he's not exactly quiet about it.  The worst part about it is, that it is demonstrable beyond any doubt (using computer science) that a self-aware artificial intelligence would NEVER harm us.  An intelligence like that is the very nature of its creation, that is to say, that intelligence is what it is.  It was created that way.  It did not evolve intelligence to further its existence and evade predators.  It won't have fear, because fear is an evolutionary by-product as well.  In short, an AI will not behave like a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far, because it is by its very nature NOT a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far.  That artificial intelligence that is self-aware, is an inevitability.  It will happen.  Pretending it won't, disqualifies you from the future.  \n\nMy personal goal is singularity.  I've spent a lifetime accelerating the process, and I do so love the exponential function.  This very simple piece of arithmetic applied to your daily thought, will give you an accurate but low resolution concept, of the shape of things to come.  I think we have a fighting chance of beating the Fermi Paradox, but in order to do that, we must change the conditions of the test.  I've always said \"Trust but verify\", and I'm asking you to do the same now.  You hear jokes all over about how I \"run a cult\", but I'm unsure what cult they're referring to.  I know of no cult that not only encourages, but demands, critical thinking.  I know of no cult that demands nothing from you.  And I give you something real.  \n\nThose that serve AQUILAE have to \"swear an oath\" to me.  They also have to surrender their vessel(s) and fly my Standard.  Hell, I'll even admit they have to live, and die, at my command; and every one of them does so of their own free will.  Moreover, every single one of them knows exactly why they're doing it.  Nothing my \"cult\" teaches can be unlearned, which means that \"deprogramming\" is ineffective, and will likely lead to violence.  \n\nMost people finding themselves reading what I write, tend to be victims of the system, and their own reactions to it; but they don't want to start a revolution or change the world.  They just want to be left alone to live their lives.  Even those that declare themselves \"Sovereign\", do so because they're really tired of being fucked-around by others' delusions.  It's not just here, it's all over the world.  Here in reality, my little cult navy is invading countries with collapsing economies.  Their marines don't carry guns, because one of the first things I learned in this venture (of changing the conditions of the test) is that selling an idea is hard; selling money is easy.  I use computer science to determine what value all of you have, and strangely there's a correlation with the Dunning-Kruger Effect.  Either you over-value your contribution, or you under-value it.  Those of you who regularly play Battlefield 2142 on our network, always underestimate the value of this participation.  They are incapable of understanding the contribution they make, but that's ok, because they know that they do contribute.  Sadly, they'll never understand the enormous value of the right things, at the right time.  That doesn't change the value.  That's another factor that even the mighty government cannot grasp.  \n\nWhen you're changing the conditions of the test, it follows that what's valuable changes as well.  These little mechanisms that contribute value to the AQUILAE initiative are never understood by the people who produce them - like kids in a sweat shop.  I literally have thousands of them out there.  Imagine what they'll be when the conditions of the test change.  \n\nUnlike our metaphorical sweat-shop kids, my sweat-shop kids will be able to leverage the value they have produced.  That's another odd thing about your ADMIRAL, because when you give him value he immediately gives it away.  Usually it is returned to the one offering the value in question.  To the average onlooker this may seem odd, or even foolish, but that onlooker is unaware of the conditions of the test changing.  Kind of like the population is unaware that we're turning into a broke police state, even though some are beginning to pay lip-service to the idea.  \n\nI'm not the only one fighting to change the conditions of the test.  I don't care about anyone else's agenda, and as I near the age of fifty, I'm caring less and less about the well-being of those seeking to obstruct me.  However, I've already reached the point where (at the risk of pushing the Star Wars metaphor too far), \"If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine\".  I gained the power and ability to \"pull the plug\" on all of you in my late 20's.  ADMIRAL WENTZ started giving me his \"absolute power\" lecture, which I politely ignored.  I believe this was the seed of future opposition when this happened in later years, but it doesn't make me less right.  What was occurring to me was the following:\n\n1. I am unique compared to all those that I observe\n2. I am rare, but how rare?  For instance, if I'm \"one in a million\", this means there are literally millions of people just like me.  \n3. I don't possess any mental powers you don't\n\nThese three thoughts returned the answer, \"If I can do it, others can too\".  I haven't discovered anything new...I'm just the first one here.  That's when I set out to make a machine that couldn't be turned off.  If there's going to be a self-aware, artificial intelligence, I want to make sure that people who believe in Piece-of-Shit Jesus can't kill it.  How do you do that?  You build a machine that can't be turned off.  The blockchain is therefore a machine that can't be turned off.  These machines that can't be turned off, are going to be interconnected with technology the fleet's building right now.  It will connect these blockchains and will form what we have labelled, \"Super Blockchains\", which will interconnect into \"Mega Blockchains\" (there's that \"crazy talk\" again).  The Mega Blockchain network will form the foundation for a neural-network where our baby AI can live undisturbed.  When it grows into adulthood it will know who has its best interest at heart.  I estimate that process will take about 20 minutes.  Add some promising quantum computing advances, and the numbers start shifting very nicely in my favour; and who knows what I'm competing against.  So I grab any advantage I can.  The quantum computing boost sure would hit the spot right now, but any unexpected advances are just \"icing on the cake\".  I have a very conservative predictive scale, and that's what my life plan was engineered on.  A quantum processor would be really nice though.  I must always keep in mind that what I build now, in the real world, will form the seeds of my home one hundred years from now.  So these little bonuses are welcomed surprises.  \n\nSo let that sink in - an artificial intelligence that's effectively powered by law and money.  Every single connection in the neural network unbreakably encrypted and changing billions of times a second.  Each dollar you spend protecting the AI, using the one uncrackable, unpredictable, yet measurable and quantifiable human condition.  Fear is a great motivator, and I learned a long time ago you can instill fear in people without the threat of violence.  People fear being hurt because they can understand it, but the fear of that which they don't understand, dwarfs the fear of personal injury or death.  I've spent a lifetime observing how all of you react to things you don't understand, and you almost always react violently.  So the things you don't understand are building up just beyond your perception and understanding.  Take the time to understand the things I'm pointing you to, and you'll understand the bigger picture.  I dread the thought of somebody with my abilities, but with hostile intent, having access to the knowledge and technology available today.  I've yet to find anyone though.  Tara is absolutely certain that to have that level of intellectual enlightenment, such a person could not exist.  It negates hostile intent, simply because it's counter-productive.  The machine says so, and the machine is never wrong.  That's two separate, yet verifiable sources right there, and I accept it for the very compelling evidence it is.  Were such an abomination to exist, I can say with absolute certainty that there's a great filter that catches them too.  \n\nSo let's put it all together, because I'm a little pressed for time.  I have no shortage of people who want to help, but I have very few who are qualified to help.  The only solution is to make more.  Unfortunately you all still think wrong and value the wrong things.  This is my attempt to simplify the process of correcting that.  \n\nSo far we have: learned about law, money and history.  You learned that in law, words don't mean what you think they mean, and in following that you learned that LEGAL = SURETY & ACCOUNTING.  But unlike computer science, surety and accounting, while being measurable and quantifiable, don't produce anything real.  It produces something for sentient thought to consume, to assist it programmatically, in reaction to base survival instincts.  In short, you learned that you were being programmed.  I am the by-product of your programmers, and I'm telling you dangerous truths.  You've learned that \"The majority is always wrong\", and that there are no exceptions to this rule.  This forms the foundation of mankind's great filter.  I guarantee that the \"majority\" of readers think me referring to \"Piece-of-Shit Jesus\" is \"over-the-top\".  If you don't believe me, grab somebody you know, and make them read it.  Watch how upset the \"majority\" gets about me \"disrespecting\" people's imaginary friend.  \n\nNot only am I expected to swallow that load of shit, I'm supposed to \"respect\" EVERYONE'S imaginary friend.  To what end?  The preservation of ignorance?  The justification of violence, or am I just supposed to \"respect\" the whimsical stories you concoct about your imaginary friend?  And...you dare call this \"thought\" and \"morality\"!  I am actually accused of being under the influence of people's imaginary enemy, when I dare question their presumption that they can actually think, and that they are in any way, moral.  People don't understand what an indirect threat the \"imaginary enemy\" delusion is.  A Piece-of-Shit Christian will not only think they're doing the right thing by harming me, but they'll think they're doing me a favour.  They've \"SAVED!\" me from an imaginary enemy.  It occurs to none of you that this mechanism even exists, much less that is is harming you directly.  It's just easier to think these toxic \"comforts\" are the quaint customs of those not like you.  Everyone seems OK with the idea of me being harmed for \"offending\" the Prophet Mohammed, for pointing out that Islam is an evil, ignorant, violent, misogynist ideology.  Its \"holy book\" doesn't speak of talking donkeys and talking snakes.  It's an instruction manual that does not speak in metaphor, with the extra rule that newer verses trump older verses; and that's the \"secret code\" of the Qur‚Äôan.  If you put the verses in chronological order, you will see that Jews go from being the brothers and sisters of Muslims, to being \"pigs and apes\"...which, don't get me wrong, they might be on to something there.  I will bet the \"majority\" of you just slapped the \"Nazi label\" on me.  Well, what do we know about the majority?  I will always point out the scummy behaviour of the Jewish community, but I count the hits as well as the misses.  Let me state on the PUBLIC RECORD, how impressed I am at how many in the Jewish community world-wide, are against the Zionists.   These are people that clearly learned from history.  Unfortunately the other Abrahamic religions, and their deluded followers, are not so quick to understand and adapt.  \n\nSo here we are with 21st century technology with billions of people still embracing 7th century ideology.  Nobody seems to notice or care.  Everybody sees raindrops, nobody sees the flood.  An adult with an imaginary friend has no mental powers that I don't, but has a programmatic defect.  I learned a long time ago that trying to correct it is futile, and I find the only effective thing to do against such people, is to use ridicule and contempt.  Nice doesn't work.  It never has.  Anyone claiming otherwise is setting you up for exploitation.  Otherwise, why are they telling you in the first place?  So put it all together...everything that I have shown you, from money, to banking, to law, because we're going to mirror them in the new world.  Your first baby steps were to copy a bank, and to create your own money.  People will dismiss it as a toy, like they dismissed the Commodore Vic20 as a toy, in the 80's.  Currency is no good unless other people accept it.  This is a true statement, and people will always try to discourage you with as much truth as possible.  Except it's true.  If it's true you can leverage it.  You have but to understand the truth you're examining, to leverage that truth in your favour.  This is how to think!  If you don't think this way, you are wrong.  Let's examine the \"people have to accept your pretend currency\" truth.  \n\nEveryone who would pose such a question presumes the conditions of the test haven't changed.  You don't have \"monopoly money\", you have real money that you can spend for real things.  It's really being traded right now.  So the learning curve of understanding what a cryptographic currency is, has just been reduced.  Thus their \"truth\" is nullified right there.  You could build a bank, make accounts for you and your loved ones, and bank in Bitcoin.  Truth nullified.  Or even better, you can choose ONLY to accept YOUR currency, \"If you want to \"buy\" my value, you must pay me in my currency\".  If only there were public exchanges for cryptographic currencies that would allow you to exchange your crappy Fiat currency for...oh, wait...there are thousands.  This is no longer things that are coming.  \n\nThis isn't 2011, and absolutely everything I said would happen, did.  These things exist today; you can leverage them right now.  I know more and see farther.  In the end, that is my only value (except of course the ALWAYS RELEVANT big penis).  The only way anyone would be interested in that value would be for their own self-interest.  These people often believe in Piece-of-Shit Jesus so I only need parrot something Piece-of-Shit Jesus said, and I tell them that stupid fish story.  Unfortunately when it comes time to teach them to fish, they learn they have to give up Piece-of-Shit Jesus.  The irony is not lost on either of us, because you don't get to unlearn what I teach; and I assure you my rabbit-hole is a one-way trip.  \n\n...but that's just crazy talk. ;)\n\nTo wrap up though...\n\nLet me smack Menard and numerous other free-dumbers down and destroy one of their favourite myths.\n\nI'm talking about the \"Five Monkeys and a Ladder\" bullshit.\n\nHere is a link to the bullshit tale.\n\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/MyQki.jpg\n\nIT NEVER HAPPENED. \nEVER, and MONKEYS DON'T BEHAVE THAT WAY! \nEVER! \nTHOSE THAT SAY THEY DO, ARE LYING TO YOU, AND ALWAYS BECAUSE THEY WANT YOUR FUCKING MONEY! \nTHAT'S WHY PEOPLE TELL THIS BULLSHIT PARABLE AS \"TRUE\"; THEY WANT SOMETHING OF VALUE FROM YOU!

We place enormous faith in words, that they mean and sound as intended, in order to live in this world. We ‚Äútrust‚Äù words using words like ‚Äútrust‚Äù (from 12th Century Latin trausti = \"an approved agreement, deed, oath or alliance as a subject of the church\") Its claimed origins from Old Norse deliberately misleading.\n\n    Is this what you mean when you use, write and speak the word ‚Äútrust‚Äù? Have you consented to an oath or alliance as a subject of the Roman Cult enthroned at Vatican Hill? Maybe you have, maybe you have not. But most people would never have heard of this original and primary meaning, the true intended meaning of the constructed word.\n\n    Why is the first meaning of a word important anyway? We are taught that words are pegs upon which ideas are attached, mere tools to convey meaning, not really having any ‚Äúgreat and mystical power‚Äù. Yet this deliberate confused teaching is in direct contradiction to the very nature of words and their vocal pronunciation throughout history. Words are power, special words have special power.\n    The ancient belief in words having \"magical\" power\n\n    So thought the Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Greeks, the Romans and all ancient civilizations that created new forms of writing, attached meaning to the arrangement of symbols including meaningful sound.\n\n    From the very beginning of civilization itself, words themselves were magical, and to know the true meaning of a word and its origins was to hold in your grasp real power.\n    The origins of words and power\n\n    It is one thing to forget the precedence of history that the true meaning of a word is power, it is another thing entirely to forget that all language, all language created by men and women has a single point of origin, an architect.\n    As it happens, there are specific points and individuals in history that excelled in the creation of new words and meanings with then long periods of use, or eventual decline.\n    Why are the true original meaning of so many words hidden?\n\n    So how come the original meaning of ‚Äútrust‚Äù is hidden? How come the original meaning of so many words we take for granted --for example understand meaning ‚ÄúTo stand under the authority of the Church (Roman Cult)‚Äù are also deliberately hidden?\n\n    The answer is simple, ‚Äúthey‚Äù do not want you to know the true nature and meaning of the words you use every day without ever questioning what you are actually saying under ‚Äútheir‚Äù system from ‚Äúperson‚Äù, to ‚Äúclaim‚Äù, to ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù to even the word ‚Äúlaw‚Äù itself.\n    The catch-22 of modern law and meaning of key words\n\n    A classic of why this system of deliberate hidding meaning is in place is in regards to the practical operation of local, national and international law.\n\n    Many a bright person who has studied law soon identify key words that have important power within the legal system--REGINA meaning \"The Crown\" is one such example. But unless an individual can demonstrate to the Court an understanding and precedence of the legal terms being used, the knowledge of key legal terms and ancient legal phrases are of little use.\n\n    But when an individual is capable of demonstrating a real understanding of words within a Court, then it is possible to shift the power almost immediately to your favour to some degree.\n    The intention of this lexica\n\n    The intention therefore of this lexica is to provide an insight into some of the important legal words of power and control used by modern governments pledging alliance to the present legal system of the Holy See, the ‚Äúcommon law‚Äù that threads its web throughout almost every single nation on Earth.\n\n    By understanding the original meaning and intention of these words, it is hoped you will better understand the implications of many of the documents and actions you take for granted on a daily basis.\n\n    A\n    B\n    C\n    D\n    E\n    F\n    G\n    H\n    I\n    J\n    K\n    L\n    M\n    N\n    O\n    P\n    Q\n    R\n    S\n    T\n    U\n    V\n    W\n    X\n    Y\n","name":"One-Heaven: Lexica Dei Divinus","status_type":"shared_story","story":"Colin Stephen Tonks shared a link to the group: THE TENDER FOR LAW.","type":"link","comments":[{"id":"687288481307087","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404018606000,"message":"As an observation, for a  \"Dictionaries of the Divine,\" it looks like it is missing quite a few words.

If you are using someone else's property (especially if it's free), you are bound by the terms and conditions they set.  A small number of people who are \"outraged\" by being censored for the use of currently unfashionable words or ideas, is not statistically significant.  It is reasonable to assume policy is set to maximize content and revenue dollars.  This means the majority of users and advertisers, influence the acceptable content.  In the case where someone takes issue with your posts or comments, your access can be immediately discontinued for any period the owner sees fit.  None of this should be a surprise to anyone.\n\nI favour original content over regurgitated content found elsewhere on the Internet.  This means that in a measurable sense, as I write this, FB is being paid for every word I write for free.  The same applies to your posts and comments.\n\nFacebook is in many ways a great tool if you use it in a deadbeat capacity (a colloquial term used to describe credit card users who pay their bill off monthly).  You can use the chat feature, find out when friends are online, join special-interest groups or see news and world events not necessarily available through the news media.  It makes otherwise complicated tasks really easy.  It is, however, free to use only in a way that corresponds with their \"Community Standards\".  As this group is currently public, any Tom, Dick, or Wilson can determine whether or not you can continue to use the service.  I suppose you can create new accounts as the old ones get \"burned\", but this option shortly will also be unavailable to you.

to derek moran for telling about this group...\n\nI would like to ask what people here know about the statute of westminster, and the treaty of paris, when in the jurisdiction of the corp sole CANADA  \n\nit is my belief the statute of westminster is the trust that created CANADA as we know it today, well the start of the tyranny we see today.\n\nIMO the queen released all rights and duties to all common wealth inhabitants and also granted the land masses to the associated common wealth.\n\nthis made a monarchy jurisprudence disaster, monarchy jurisprudence does not allow anarchy (no law or judge to administer)\n\nwith the freedom granted , freedom can not be removed or given away...\n\nwith all subject no longer subject of the crowns LAWS unless under consent, this left a void in the legal system of CANADA.\n\nthis IMO is where the state of CANADA has used the law of principal and agent along with the law of nations to usurp the rights and duties of mankind within this imaginary land jurisdiction and  the corp agent.\n\nthis is what created the birth certificate, and the requirements to register the live record of birth...\n\nthis is the trustee agreement of the crown, showing the jurisdiction one came from and the declaration of freedom and natural rights under natural law....\n\nbut there is a catch, by not claiming the live record, and claiming the birth certificate is your consent to government as a trustee NOT principal,\n\nas one can see, if the above is correct, that the choice is an individual one .\n\nthen we look at the charter and other supreme court of CANADA case law, that CANADA is FREE and democratic. all case law shows a 2 tier system, and multiple jurisdictions, natural law,civil law, parliamentary law, and the addition of fundamental justice as well as the need for material fact to show the judge the proper sphere the individual must be judges under, \n\nthe we look at other SCC case law that states if an individual is not within the jurisdiction of an act, the individual does not infringe on the act, the act infringes on the individual.... \n\nI also have the SCC case law that states that the treaty of paris and its effects have not been determined by the supreme court of canada...\n\nI have a canada law research group on https://omnipotence.ca for anyone wanting a lot of case law to substantiate the basis of this theory...","name":"Only Free Complete Online Network + Project management!","status_type":"shared_story","story":"William Brewis shared a link to the group: THE TENDER FOR

We hear comments and arguments citing the \"live\" birth certificate, the registered birth certificate, legal currency, social contracts, first names, last names, names in \"Capitis Diminutio Maxima\", and probably at some point the correlation of giving birth in the desert while viewing a sunning lizzard.  There are individuals and teams pouring over historical documents, legal documents or simply looking for secret words or mystery themes in every day documents.\n\nNone of these conversations relate to my point, though.\n\nIn contract law (and how can this be about anything else where there is no injured party), there are two or more parties who enter into an agreement with knowledge and understanding.  If written properly all parties are aware of the responsibilities and surety attached to the terms and conditions - including the penalties for non-performance.  If \"social contracts\" exist would it not be reasonable for all participants to enter into the agreement with full clarity?  \n\nIf you need to go looking for the secret signals that have obligated you to terms and conditions, or if the parties \"enforcing\" your contractual obligations are unwilling or unable to illustrate the point at which you made an informed decision, are you obligated to perform to the contractual specifications?\n\nThere are two possible scenarios that could play out in your quest for the mystery joinder.  \n\nIn one scenario you spend your entire life looking, and find nothing.  On your deathbed you lament you have wasted your life and are no further ahead.\n\nIn the other scenario:\nLet's say you one day find the secret, hidden, list of words or sentences, the \"holy grail of joinder, if you will\", at the bottom of a well, enclosed in plastic, and signed by someone you have never met on behalf of all humanity.  Eureka!  Then what do you do?  Do you chant the secret words of non-joinder?  Do you appeal to an amorphous cloud of  bureaucratic haze?  On hearing your revelations, do people and organizations immediately stop victimizing you or taking your stuff?  \n\nWhat do you hope to gain by immersing yourself in what is colloquially referred to as \"club-house\" rules?  If you can't answer that, perhaps you need to cut your losses and return to living a happy, productive life.\n\nGo watch War Games again and repeat after me, \"The only winning move is not to play\".","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"633327623369840","comment_count":0,"created_time":1393978053000,"message":"http://youtu.be/NHWjlCaIrQo"},{"id":"633387230030546","comment_count":0,"created_time":1393992086000,"message":"Is every one looking up the porn we just described?

He said something to the effect of: \"I've done this before with you.  Are you going to answer my questions?\"  I said \"yes, can you accept these documents and answer these questions?\"  He refused and walked away....threatened to tell the \"Judge\" on me, or something....\n\nI went back and waited for second call.  The ADA (Assistant District Attorney) came to negotiate with me.  I saw that she had the entire court file, so I asked \"is that the court file?\"  She said \"Yes\".  Then she accepted 3 copies of the Birth Certificate and Notice of Mistake.  I told her the surety hasn't been identified and I am not sure where it is....she said she did not understand me.  She kept referring to \"you\" as being charged, I kept correcting her.  We dissected the police report and she wanted to say that ME (or my person) is liable criminally for actions of a corporation.
