You ask if the common law can be accurately described as “the law of the land”.\n\nMy own reaction is that this would not be a useful description of the common law. “The law of the land” suggests to me a rule of law or a set of laws that must be obeyed. It would be mandatory and of general application.\n\nThe common law is not such a law. It is more of an underlying, private, gap-filling collection of rules of law that allow relations among the people who live here to be conducted in predictable and fair ways - at least in principle. When the common law does not meet that expectation, governments often step in and change it by statute. The example I used in my earlier correspondence was consumer protection legislation. Occupiers’ liability legislation is another example.\n\nIt is certainly fair to say that the Constitution of Canada is the law of the land, and other laws must conform to it in order to be valid. But the Constitution is not the common law, it is a statute. Not only must other statutes conform to the Constitution, but courts must interpret the common law in accordance with it.\n\nOnce again, thank you for contacting the Ministry. \n\nJohn D.

Would you (John Doe) in your private capacity kindly confirm who “You” is, and/or forward this correspondence to You.\n\nI have no knowledge of who “You” and/or “*** MASON” and/or any such other identification your department/you and/or The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has addressed me as. I respectfully ask; by what authority is The Office of the Revenue Commissioners addressing me as such? \nPlease define what a liable person is please under your acts and statutes?\nAs I am not a qualified solicitor or barrister I do not understand acts and statutes, as such I will not be forced to agree or be held liable for something I do not understand.\n\nThe Office of the Revenue Commissioners are under no circumstances to withdraw or steal money from my private pension, as I have not given *** BUIDING SOCIETY, you or The Office of the Revenue Commissioners permission to do so and I will never give my permission for you or The Office of the Revenue Commissioners to take money from me without my written consent.\n\nIt seems to me that in the matter for surety for the LEGAL NAME,  I believe that there has been a mistake as the sole beneficiary has been incorrectly identified, therefore under no circumstances are you or The Office of the Revenue Commissioners to be party to the theft of my money.\n\nWhat evidence does The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have that I am a trustee and have any surety with respect to the LEGAL NAME?\n\nWhat evidence does The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have that I am an OFFICER, an AGENT, a TRUSTEE or an EMPLOYEE of The Government of Ireland?\n \nThere is no evidence that there has been any meeting of the minds, any proper notice given, any considerable CONSIDERATION offered, or that I have any intent to contract in this matter.\n\nI have no obligation to file any such Local Property Tax (LPT) Return.\n\nYou (John Doe) are on Notice that if you, your office/The Office of the Revenue Commissioners steal money from me in an unlawful action from my private\npension without my written permission I will be holding you (John Doe) personally liable in your private capacity and I may be seeking An Garda Síochána to investigate your (John Doe) actions under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Persons Act, 1997 and/or Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001.\n\nAs such, I am returning your OFFER, DECLINED, for immediate DISCHARGE and CLOSURE.\n\nNotice: Failure by you (John Doe) in your private capacity to respond within 7 (SEVEN) days of receipt of this correspondence shall constitute legal accord and satisfaction of all claims.\n\nYours in truth, sincerity and honour,\n\nAUTHORZIED BY______________________          DATE____________________\nMason\nSigned in the capacity of an inherent woman of original jurisdiction.\nAll rights reserved\n\nI could only attach one scan of their response with this post so the second will be added on a seperate post.","object_id":"10151796368598633","status_type":"added_photos","type":"photo","comments":[{"id":"937741899595076","comment_count":0,"created_time":1454361669000,"message":"I'm going to have to get one of your T-shirts made up Pete 😃"},{"id":"937740122928587","comment_count":0,"created_time":1454361325000,"message":"You crazy Irish :P"},{"id":"937738676262065","comment_count":0,"created_time":1454361009000,"message":"How did this end Lee?

As this is my forum, I think I will prevent the concept of TRUSTS being diminished any further by this scam. \n\nSo OPPF it is.\n\nBefore I get started about this, I'm going to raise another TRUST system.  It should have died at the outset because one guy ends up with the money.  I'm talking about bitcoin, except you can TRUST and VERIFY bitcoin.  It is a mathematical process that requires no trust.  You don't need to trust bitcoin any more than you need to trust 2 + 2 = 4; and that's why bitcoin is a perfectly viable currency until the guy who started it gets all the money.\n\nIt is an automated-accounting, self-regulated currency.  Bitcoin is the by-product of our knowledge of fundamental universal truths regarding numbers.  For math is a pure discipline.  There's nothing more to learn about it, and trillions of undiscovered things you can do with what we know.\n\nI see a beauty and elegance, and even humour for those who can read the math in bitcoin.  And that's why you can TRUST, because you get to VERIFY.\n\nNow let's look at the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD. \n\nThose that can't be bothered clogging up valuable intellect with bullshit, can reduce OPPF to its base components...and it basically goes like this...\n\nThree guys “reclaim” the world's wealth by way of the UCC, backed by the people in the TRUST.  Except in every context with the UCC SERVICING NOTICE, etc., they are all LEGAL CLAIMS.  The mere fact that you are GIVING NOTICE acknowledges the process.  A TRUST cannot make aggressive moves like SERVING NOTICE and MAKING A CLAIM.  A TRUST has AUTHORITY over what it RECEIVES.  TRUSTS exist to fulfill a purpose based on ASSETS it has RECEIVED.  \n\nA TRUST IS NOT A PERSON UNDER LAW.  \n\nA TRUST IS NOT A PARTY UNDER LAW.\n\nAnd a TRUST can only RECEIVE.\n\nThe AQUILAE TRUST, for example, has a PRIMARY MANDATE to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to The House of Windsor.  This is a relatively unattainable goal.  I don't think I'll see Queen Elizabeth II saying, “Off with his head” in my lifetime, but that is, in fact, its PRIMARY MANDATE.  \n\nAs it is a PRIVATE TRUST (PRIVATEER) we stand by to SERVE The House of Windsor.  The House of Windsor can give AQUILAE an ORDER, and can TRUST that the ORDERS will be followed, even though The House of Windsor has no LEGAL or LAWFUL AUTHORITY over AQUILAE.\n\nEvery TRUSTEE is aware of this, and if 'Liz says, “Suit up and go to war”, we “Suit up and go to war”, because we said we would and she can TRUST us to do so.\n\nPROMISARY NOTES have the CREDIT and WORTH of those making the promises.  ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD are making promises they cannot LEGALLY AND/OR LAWFULLY keep.  \n\nIt is therefore reasonable to presume, based on the preponderance of EVIDENCE, that the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD exists SOLEY for the purpose of profiting from your credulity.\n\nYou have often heard me speak ill of Robert Menard, but I want you to pay close attention to what I speak.  Robert Menard tells the absolute TRUTH about the law.  In fact, I dare say you can almost (but not quite) TRUST what he says about law.  If it's the TRUTH it doesn't matter who says it.  2 + 2 = 4.  It doesn't matter if I say it, or if Robert Menard says it, or if Charles Manson says it...2 + 2 will still equal 4. \n\nHowever, Robert Menard lies through omission.  If you ever want to see Robert Menard fumble around, and ask bullshit-deflecting questions, just ask him what “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER” means.  \n\nONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD is FRAUD at the outset.  Always remember the noble lie.  If it requires BELIEF in anything, spirits, gods, fairies, etc., you are being sold FRAUD.  There are no exceptions to this rule.\n\nFrom childhood you are sold the lie that faith and trust are equal, and they reinforce it with other lies like, “You must respect the beliefs of others.”  Think about that for a second.  Why must I respect the beliefs of others?  Why have belief at all?  If you examine the concept, belief is an end.  It means you don't have to go looking any further.  It means you can “just assume”, never having once examine WHY it should be believed.\n\nObserve the threads in this very forum.  My mere public position that “your ignorance does not equal my knowledge” immediately gets a million ad hominem attacks.  I collect the names you call me like trophies, and all of you that call me these things remind me that none of you are capable of having original thought.\n\nAll because I have offended your “beliefs”.  \n\nAnd you enter with the arrogant position that if I don't believe what you do, there must be something wrong with me, which reveals your hypocrisy.  You see, in order for you to have the opportunity to say these things about me, you most certainly would have had to initiate the communication; because the only reason you would talk to me is because you want my knowledge.  \n\nI would not talk to you.  Your very beliefs negate the possibility of UNDERSTANDING.  You have nothing of VALUE for me, and presenting an “alternate view” which focuses on bullshit always seems to neglect to mention the fact that it is, in fact, focused on bullshit. \n\nIn short, belief has no VALUE.  Those who say it does are selling you FRAUD, and you must always suspect the motives of those selling demonstrable FRAUD as TRUST.\n\nThe most primitive example of the self-imposed ignorance of belief can be found in Roman Numerals; and before I start with this I just want to remind everyone that the Ancient Greeks calculated the circumference of the earth, so the concept of zero was well-known throughout history.  If you BELIEVE otherwise, examine the source of that belief and you will discover it is, in fact, bullshit.\n\nThe number zero represents fifty percent of all math in existence.  If you do not understand that statement, and do not understand why that is, you are not qualified to speak of math.  I digress...\n\nI think of my own personal knowledge of computer science, and the vast technological powers I wield simply because “nobody else knows how to do it.”  I cringe in empathetic fear for humanity when I look upon its nine billion souls, all in some way, intimately tied to science and technology, and knowing nothing about science and technology.  Even the most simple-minded amongst you cannot be so stupid that they cannot see this situation is a recipe for disaster.\n\nAnd every day, I'll hear some ignorant, credulous adult, with an imaginary friend, declare that I am ignorant, and that I am “closed-minded”, of course; and this is my personal favorite, that I'm “mentally ill” or some sub-category therein. \n\nThese people truly believe that their ignorance is wisdom, and that their belief equals my knowledge; and that is precisely why I DO NOT RESPECT THE BELIEFS OF OTHERS.\n\nLet's jump back in time to the Romans.  The Romans had a technologically-evolving society.  Mathematics and computer science were actually in heavy use, and numeric policy and process allowed those that could conceptualize the math to engineer aqueducts that are working to this day.  \n\nComputer Science is profoundly powerful knowledge.  I have the ability to literally speak to the universe, and it will speak back – in numbers.  The test for intelligence is the test of understanding prime numbers, for these things are universal, and all of it requires not one scrap of belief.\n\nThose who don't see that only prove my point, because it's as true as 2 + 2 = 4...\n\n...and I'll demonstrate with the Romans.\n\nBookkeeping's a boring job, isn't it?  Those who have been saddled with such a task will know what I'm describing when I speak of numbers dancing in your head, and you, being a pattern-seeking mammal, indulge yourself in the boredom   by seeing how you make these numbers dance in a pattern you have not yet seen.\n\nThis is actually a very profound process and a lot of people miss it.  The last thing the Romans wanted were smart bookkeepers.  Bookkeepers make the rules.  None of you see that.  Watch “The Agenda” with Steve Paikin.  VALE and the Chartered Accountants of Ontario sponsor the show, and they'll proudly tell you how long they've been setting PUBLIC POLICY.  \n\nNone of you are aware of this, because none of you think; and Steve Paikin's shows are for people who can think, so there's zero risk of discovery.\n\nYou can see for yourself, your masters laughing at your idiocy.\n\nAll the belief in the world is not going to change that reality....\n\n...back to the Romans.\n\nA society that's growing as a result of computer science needs to hide the computer science part.  I know more than you do by default.  I've simply dedicated more time to any subject you raise than you have to studying it.  It doesn't matter what you believe...this is simply true.  \n\nI don't possess any mental powers you don't; and I don't possess any mental powers that the bookkeeper with “dancing-numbers-in-his-head” has.  \n\nYou can see where this is going.\n\nDiscovery of computer science is inevitable, and accountants will find it first.  I'm not going to find any gold in the Klondike if I don't go to the Klondike.  You're not going to find computer science if you don't go to where math is used constantly.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to one simple goal.  How do you stop a smart, little bookkeeper from discovering computer science, without affecting the quality of his work?  Enter the Roman Numeral system.  \n\nLiteracy was restricted to the upper casts; and the ignorant will leap and cling to what they can understand.  In less than one generation the Roman Numeral system was injected into society with the DECLARATION, “This is math!”\n\n...and there you have it.  The next generation will truly believe that Roman Numerals are actual numbers.  They show the math function, and thus no one has reason to believe that the declaration, “This is math” was a lie, or that anyone's agenda was being served by believing that lie.\n\nSuch beliefs cause the believers of Roman Numerals to say that those “crazy people” who have no faith in the Roman Numeral system and their kooky religious terms like fast Fourier transform (FFT), Fibonacci  Sequences, and calculus are just products of their ignorance...\n\n...is this sounding familiar?\n\nDo you get the idea?\n\nAnd so we return to ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD.\n\nIn the comments below I'll go step-by-step through the very base principles your beliefs have made you blind to.  Unlike any other time in history, we all have the wealth of human knowledge at our fingertips.  The ONLY weapon that those who work against your interests possess, is your ignorance.  Belief is what gives ignorance VALUE to them.\n\nIgnorance serves those working against your interests.\n\nThe people who sell you these FRAUDS are so effective because they truly believe in them, and of course that belief serves another unseen agenda...\n\n...because the people that mean you harm, don't actually know you.  It's not personal.  You're a cow to be herded, because THEY took the time to learn things YOU didn't.\n\nAnd to the adults with imaginary friends, I dare say you attribute every “good” quality in you to that imaginary friend; and all the bad qualities in you, you attribute to yourself, because you're “a horrible wretched sinner” that needs “forgiving” for some unknown crime called “sin”.  \n\nThere really are people that laugh at the fact that immorality is sold as morality.  It gives them comfort that in 2013, declaring that you're an adult with an imaginary friend is not only “normal”, but is in fact a prerequisite for becoming President of the United States.\n\nI'm told that Governor of Alaska is another possibility too.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out why stating the truth is “ego”.  It is always the first motivator that I'm accused of.  I suspect it's loosely connected to the other strange belief that people's hurt feelings make my position wrong; and if they're Christian they seem to think some sort of harm should come to me as a result. They counter this vile thought with some empty expression of “love”, because Love hasn't been diminished by belief enough!\n\nYou have to see things from my perspective as well.  When you declare that you're “offended”, there's an automatic process that I programmed, with intent in my head, and it routes all data from that point on, to the same place in my head that I route whining.  For, in the end, when you say that you're offended, you should just presume that my response is, “So what?”  You're whining does not change what I said.\n\nAll that being said, I request you, friends, comrades, brothers, sisters, to try to keep the banter to a minimum; and I know I'm as guilty as you are for this...\n\nI've had a good stern talk with myself on the subject regarding this thread.\n\nI am going to go through this whole document of THE ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD.  We're going to play “Biology Class” with this piece of LEGAL BULLSHIT.\n\nI am going to put this fake “living document” (powered by “Belief”) on the stainless steel table, and while it cries out for mercy, I shall carve out its entrails, piece-by-piece.  And we shall examine these entrails while it writhes in pain.\n\nAnd then we'll toss away those pieces because they don't survive the light of understanding.  At the end of our little legal biology class, with two goals accomplished, you will see the ONE PEOPLE'S PUBLIC FRAUD for what it is, and I will have given it the slow and painful execution it so richly deserves.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"489504647752139","comment_count":0,"created_time":1362679193000,"message":"Well that puts THEM in the same position the Government puts YOU - No \"outside\" to go to.\n\nThey should be on street corners selling pencils in a cup, instead they make POLICY.

This assumes your agent is familiar with the legal and technical implications of this emerging practice.  \n\nSome of the things I might want to know before opting in would be:  How is the data stored?  What is their contingency plan when it fails?  What protections are in place to prevent the data being accessed by third parties?  What happens if I don't agree?  What is done with the data if I'm no longer employed by the company (i.e. will the data be deleted, retained, etc.)?  If a regulatory body/third party requests the data will it be made available to them?\n\nAs Scott mentioned, if you have not signed an employment contract indicating you have agreed to this practice you can decline; however they can fire you for non-compliance.\n\nMost people will agree to this without thinking, which appears to be the default state of most humans these days.  If qualified your union should be representing the interests of its constituency -- if qualified.  It should also be noted that the union optimally represents the majority of its members - if no one has an issue, the union usually doesn't as well.\n\nThe last consideration should be how committed you are to not disseminating your biometric information.

I have THE INTERNET, and I understand how EVERYTHING works. More people read about World War Two today, than they did during World War Two! There's more people alive! We can communicate vast amounts of information, instantly. Humanity has NEVER had that ability, in history. All because of computer science. It truly is THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING.\n\nIt also adds a new factor, that the Law Society was NEVER prepared for. \n\nCan you see a \"Perfect Storm\" gathering? :D Pete Daoust will go down in history, one way or another!

You have failed.  Until you can produce evidence Johno, go and do something productive, like volunteering at a soup kitchen for the homeless.\n\nIt’s funny how you tell me about interest accruing on the account in question Johno, especially at this time of year, Christmas.  Are you a Christian Johno, or a Jew, Buddhist, Hindu or do you follow one of the Islamic faiths?\n\nThe reason I ask Johno, is because usury is one of the most reprehensible non-criminal practices someone can do to his fellow man.  \n\nHere’s what Wikipedia has to say on the subject:\n…’ According to some dictionaries, simply charging any interest at all can be considered usury’…\n\n…”Some of the earliest known condemnations of usury come from the Vedic texts of India.  Similar condemnations are found in religious texts from Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  At times, many nations from ancient China to ancient Greece to ancient Rome have outlawed loans with any interest. Though the Roman Empire eventually allowed loans with carefully restricted interest rates, the Christian church in medieval Europe banned the charging of interest at any rate.”…\n\nWhy do you think usury is such a disgusting, immoral act Johno?\n\nThink of it this way:  If there is only $100.00 in existence, and I loan it all to you, at the very reasonable rate of 1% interest, no matter what you do, you can never pay me back in full because there is more debt than there is money to pay it, so the interest compounds to ridiculous levels.\n\nSo consequently Johno, I can then come and claim your home, throw you, your missus and kids out on the street and make you all destitute, for 1% on money that doesn’t even exist!  What a crappy thing to do to my fellow man, even when he gave me all that he owed me, my greed would result in him being homeless.  What an absolutely scummy cruel and horrible thing to do!\n\nWith usury, any interest rate, no matter how small, ultimately results in there being more debt than there is money to repay it.  Ultimately, someone (or many someones) end up losing their homes, turn to drugs and alcohol, prostitution, marriages end, families are destroyed, people end up on the street…all because some scumbag (or group of scumbags) value bits of paper and plastic with pictures on them (and made up numbers on a computer screen, more than they care about their fellow man.\n\nSo Merry Christmas Johno, think of the homeless when you tuck into that big turkey, or seafood platter or whatever you munch down on for Christmas dinner.  \n\nSpare a thought for the girl selling her body on the street because her old man suicided after losing the family home as your kids rip open their toys and other useless crap that will be piled up in the back of the garage never to be used again.  And try to look your wife in the eye as you tell her that you really do something that creates a brighter future for all Australians, instead of serving the corporate greed of banks that create money out of thin air.  \n\nWell done Johno, keep looking at yourself in the mirror and convincing yourself that you’re a good bloke as you sign your letters threatening hardship and penalties on your fellow man, without even bothering to make sure that there is a valid debt in the first place.  I’m sure that’s what your parents wanted for you when you were growing up, your mother must be so proud.\n\nDisclaimer:  the rape baby birthday party is not an event I celebrate...but it's always fun to stick it to those that do...just to reveal a small part of the hypocrisy...for education purposes only, of course ;-)"},{"id":"703453833023885","comment_count":0,"created_time":1407374191000,"message":"Old post sure, but excellent comments Pete Daoust, Scott Duncan and Stuart Stone.

A \"bench warrant\" is an order to appear issued by the court when a person does not appear for a hearing, which can be resolved by posting bail or appearing. A \"search warrant\" is an order permitting a law enforcement officer to search a particular premises and/or person for certain types of evidence, based on a declaration by a law enforcement official, including a district attorney. 2) v. to claim to a purchaser that merchandise is sound, of good quality, or will perform as it should, or that title to real property belongs to the seller. (See: search warrant, search and seizure, guarantee)>>\n\nIn this case, if you notice, the use of \"individual\" is not used.

I'd appreciate help breaking this apart. \n\nMy intention was to have an \"official\" communique from the Attorney General's office to establish that Ontario is indeed a common law jurisdiction. It seems to raise more questions than it answers. \n\nMy hope here is to put some \"powerful\" questions to him that will either \"force\" him to lie (due to his oath to protect the law society), or, have him admit some facts that may serve me/us in the future.\n\nHere's the response:\n\n****\n\nThank you for your recent inquiry to the Ministry of the Attorney General’s web site about whether Ontario is a common law jurisdiction.  I have been asked to respond on behalf of the Ministry.\n\nIt is accurate to say that Ontario is a common law jurisdiction, that is, a territory with applicable law based in part on the common law.\n\nThe expression ‘common law’ refers to the law developed over the years by judges in deciding court cases. The expression is usually used to distinguish this body of law from ‘statute law’, i.e. the law adopted in statutes passed by the Legislature or by Parliament for Canada as a whole.  However, statute law prevails over common law, so the Legislature can change the common law by passing legislation.\n\nThe Legislature’s powers are limited by the Constitution both as to the division of legislative powers between the federal and the provincial government, and by individual rights protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nFor example, much of the law about contracts is common law; it arises from court decisions about individual lawsuits that involved contracts.  However, the Legislature has passed the Sale of Goods Act (in the late 19th century) and the Consumer Protection Act (in the mid-20th century) to clarify or to improve the rules about contracts, or to make them more accessible to the general public.\n\nIn most cases a mix of sources of the law will apply to any situation. Legal rules are not more or less valid because they have more or less common law or statutory content.\n\nThe Ministry of the Attorney General publishes several general guides to the law online. General legal information is available at Justice Ontario, the Ministry’s legal information site. To access Justice Ontario, please visit our website at:\n\n www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/justice-ont/\n\n A source of both court decisions and the text of statutes for all of Canada – federal government and the provinces – is www.canlii.org, a product of the Federation of Law Societies.\n\n Once again, thank you for contacting the Ministry. \n\nJohn D.

It appears this Act came into force the same year as the Charter (UK CANADA ACT 1982)\n\nI've skimmed through the Act and the word PERSON appears in various forms a whopping 474 times!  As well as 7 instances of the words NATURAL PERSON.\n\nHere's a few other things in the Act I found interesting:\n\n3.  [...] The courts within the meaning of the Courts of Justice Act (chapter T-16) are not public bodies.   \n\n1982, c. 30, s. 3; 1982, c. 62, s. 143; 1992, c. 21, s. 375.\n\n5. Municipal bodies include\n\n (3) a mixed enterprise company established under the Act respecting mixed enterprise companies in the municipal sector (chapter S-25.01) and a similar body established under a private Act, in particular the legal persons constituted under chapters 56, 61 and 69 of the statutes of 1994, chapter 84 of the statutes of 1995 and chapter 47 of the statutes of 2004.  (See chapter 56)\n\n54. In any document, information concerning a natural person which allows the person to be identified is personal information.\n\n1982, c. 30, s. 54; 2006, c. 22, s. 110.\n\n56. The name of a natural person is not personal information, except where it appears in conjunction with other information concerning him, or where the mere mention of his name would disclose personal information concerning him.\n\n1982, c. 30, s. 56; 2006, c. 22, s. 110.\n\n58. The sole fact that a signature is affixed at the bottom of a document does not make the information shown therein personal.\n\n1982, c. 30, s. 58; 2006, c. 22, s. 110\n\nI know they simply can't SEE the man, so to speak and that I don't want to claim NATURAL PERSONhood. I have re-read Persons for Idiots and Agency for Idiots yet I'm still not certain what they're games is here.  Is this just another attempt at getting joinder or something else?...

In the past the CRA had sent a remittance voucher so currently I have nothing to administrate.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"902803396422260","comment_count":0,"created_time":1447470538000,"message":"physically that night NO."},{"id":"901959446506655","comment_count":0,"created_time":1447268992000,"message":"Once it's done, if ever they are going after the payroll, you will then be able to supply the employer with an AFFIDAVIT affirming that the debt has been settled :D"},{"id":"902804433088823","comment_count":0,"created_time":1447470883000,"message":"no"},{"id":"901968083172458","comment_count":0,"created_time":1447271234000,"message":"Fuck :("},{"id":"901958846506715","comment_count":0,"created_time":1447268844000,"message":"Ask Beverly Berta Braakschmack, or go on their website"},{"id":"901827739853159","comment_count":0,"created_time":1447241945000,"message":"Yes."},{"id":"901952359840697","comment_count":0,"created_time":1447267563000,"message":"Why don't give them a call, and ask for what is the amount of money they want?\n\nYou could then print one of these remittence on their website and administrate that debt.\n\n:/"},{"id":"901955109840422","comment_count":0,"created_time":1447268249000,"message":"I was wondering why no remittance was sent, that is the plan.
