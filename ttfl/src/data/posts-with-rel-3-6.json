(1) Subject to this Act, a bill must be duly presented for payment.\nIf not presented\n(2) If a bill is not duly presented for payment, the drawer and endorsers are discharged.\n\n\"First of all, you need to know what a BILL is, and what a bill is NOT! An INVOICE, or STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT is NOT a BILL! Do they say BILL on them? NO! They say INVOICE, or STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT or CHARGE, not BILL!

(1) Every party whose signature appears on a bill is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, deemed to have become a party thereto for value.\"\n\nMissing\nWhat required of corporation\n5. In the case of a corporation, where, by this Act, any instrument or writing is required to be signed, it is sufficient if the instrument or writing is duly sealed with the corporate seal, but nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the bill or note of a corporation to be under seal.\nSo the corporate logo/letterhead at the top of the page is a seal.\n\n\"I think you should be getting very excited by now! This is telling you that if you sign the bill, you gave it value! It’s telling you that your signature IS the money! BY signing the bill, and returning it to them, you gave them value! It says, “In absence of evidence to the contrary”. Where is that going to come from?\"\n\nMisleading here because it says \"By signing the bill...\" , yet he already said that we don't have a bill, and they will never give one, so how do we sign the bill? Does he mean to convert the invoice to a completed bill of exchange? (Pete's thread covers that...)\n\n\"What if they refuse to provide a bill? Then they have admitted to no obligation!\"\nMissing same as above...\n\n\"If they refuse to give you a bill, you can now take out a blank piece of paper, fill it out as a bill with them as drawer and payee,....\"\n\nI am pretty sure that Scott said that a bill of exchange should be notarized.\n\n\" If they threaten to call the police, YOU CALL THE POLICE! \"\nThis looks like the worst part of the whole article!

If you are indeed honest and really care about good honest hard working men and women to not be victims of that corrupt system, I'd be curious to hear what you'd have to say about this, as it does seem reasonable to believe that, as a former lawyer, you'd be able to answer the following question :\n\nConsidering that it seems to be TRUE that a person is a legal entity, a tool, that's created by the state, after a man or woman baby started living, without his/her consent, for that man or woman to use and/or exist and/or be abused, in the commercial / legal / public debt slavery world ;\n\nAnd considering that it still seems to be TRUE that every man or woman has the right to his/her person's surety/security, as recognized by any charter of rights, pretty much everywhere in the world ;\n\nAnd considering that it still seems to be TRUE that a surety/security has everything to do with the performance of an obligation vs a debt ;\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/surety\nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/security\n\nAnd considering that a signature is proof of surety, and that my signature doesn't appear anywhere on the person's birth certificate ;\n\nI'D LIKE TO KNOW :\n\nIs it TRUE that public debts and/or charges addressed and/or brought up against a person, can be discharged by that person's surety/security ?\nYES or NO ?\n\nAlso, is it TRUE that the words \"This note is legal tender\", written on USD notes, mean that these notes are an offer for law, and that any person using those dollars is deemed to have accepted the fact that all government acts, codes and statutes apply ? YES or NO ?\n\nAnd is that part of what \"the consent of the governed\" is based on ?\n\nAnd finally, can you disclose what it is, that an attorney actually attorns ?\n\nThanks a lot !\nI'm pretty confident many will be awaiting your answers to those questions ;)\n\nhttps://steemit.com/steemit/@steemship/creating-liberty-island-my-perspective-on-steemit","name":"Creating Liberty Island: My Perspective on Steemit — Steemit","status_type":"shared_story","story":"Pete Daoust shared a link to the group: THE TENDER FOR LAW.","type":"link","comments":[{"id":"1049199468449318","comment_count":0,"created_time":1471112011000,"message":"\"FORMER lawyer\"?

I normally let these things play out, because I like to show off how I deal with these ill-prepared \"surprises\".  Often you'll find that when I do something that appears \"Godlike\", closer examination reveals that I'd simply altered small things in the past to engineer my way out of future problems.\n\nI've done this all my life and it makes for some interesting experiences, not the least of which is infiltrators.\n\nToday we're going to talk about infiltrators.\n\nI want to discuss the behaviour, dialogue, and the \"red flags\" that alert you to an infiltrator.  \n\nOne of the great things about being me is that you don't know how much I know about you.  You barely understand the technology you use, and the same is true with infiltrators.  I often do things deliberately \"sloppy\" and even let the odd \"warez\" group onto our network, just to act as a \"Honey Pot\" and to take a bunch of NSA agents out of commission.  For as long as they're looking at the shiny objects I leave around, they are not looking at you.\n\nAn officer, and crew member, of the Tyson were using the Lou Manotti and Roguesupport Nx  accounts, and reading THE TENDER FOR LAW, which is baffling because they have direct access to my entire library...but no accounting for taste.  Contrary to what you may think, THE TENDER FOR LAW is not my best work.  \n\nAnyway, officers and crew of the Tyson noticed a member whose posts consist almost exclusively of wrong answers, erroneous conclusions, out-of-context quotes and numerous calls to violence.  At this point I would like to state that if you're doing anything under the banner of AQUILAE you do not cause or inflict violence.  That is a RIGHT reserved exclusively for officers.  The rules are very simple.  If you're going to inflict violence make sure you're an AQUILAE officer first.  If you check and you find out you are not an AQUILAE officer; DON'T.\n\nNow I try to give all of you the benefit of the doubt.  The poster in question is a regular contributor to THE TENDER FOR LAW, but he only showed up late in the second phase.  \n\n...I'm talking about you, Jason Moreland.  \n\nSo as is my way, we're going to drag you out onto the deck, and disect this problem piece-by-piece.\n\nThe default position it that Mr. Moreland is simply dumb and angry because of what he has discovered.  If no other answer comes up, then that will be the position henceforth.  If this is in fact the case, I remind Mr. Moreland that he thinks wrong, and values the wrong things; which means any intent and/or plans he forms at this point are 100% guaranteed to be based on the wrong things, and the wrong thought-process.  This also means there is a 100% chance of failure...\n\n...SO STOP!\n\nIf this is the case I can \"leverage a negative\", and can use Mr. Moreland's many posts as  \"red flag indicators\" when hunting down infiltrators.  You can find many writings on this subject, however we're just going to deal with the basics.  \n\nThe first indicator of an infiltrator is somebody who is just a little too enthusiastic about the cause in question.  You'll often find them repeatedly asking questions about very basic things while skillfully using their feined ignorance to switch a few words around.  You'll also find Robert Menard doing this shit too, so it's not a hard, fast rule - rather an indicator.  Look for phrases like, \"Are you saying *insert bullshit here*?\", and the presumptuous weasel-word questions that are prefixed with \"Don't you think...\" (I preemptively answer \"NO\" to those).  \n\nSecond indicator are calls to violence.  Nobody understands the urge to inflict violence on these pieces-of-shit more than I do.  If you intend to inflict violence, do it right.  Homicide is very, very easy.  It's stupidly easy.  I guarantee that any one of you could kill ten people with a steak knife before anyone could even form the intent to stop you.  In my books, that's stupidly easy.  If you fuck up killing somebody, you deserve your fate.  Many murders are meticulously planned, and go off without a hitch, but the perpetrator still gets caught.  Never plan FOR violence; plan for AFTER the violence.  The violence itself is just a formality.  It's surprisingly easy to do; and a lot of fun.  It solves a problem, gives closure, and let's you move forward.  I speak from experience.  I can even say right here on this open forum to all the cops watching that I killed that fat piece-of-shit that is your colleague.  I garotted him myself with a guitar string.  I even left a note.  So why aren't I sitting in jail with a bunch of gomers chanting \"cop killer\"?  \n\nThe reason I can say this is that they would have to reveal that the dead land-whale in question sent an Islamic Sand-Nigger out to kill my child; and that's not something your masters want attention drawn to.  Look what I've done since then!  You're not bright enough to put it together, but I've already won.  And now I've got nothing to do with the rest of my life but hunt down those who dared write their signatures endorsing harm to me and to those I love.  You can send all the infiltrators you like.  You can use all the blackmailed confidential informants that you like.  You could spread disinformation...hell you can even call me crazy!  But that's not really going to change anything.  I taught a bunch of idiots on the Internet how to build their own fucking banks.  On Facebook of all things.  Ask yourself what I've done with people who have sworn to live and die at my command.\n\nTo Jason Moreland: If you are an infiltrator, take pause and reflect on what you're doing.  The problem with all infiltrators is that when they read what I write, they know it's true.  It's not opinion, it's not hypothesis, it's not even an expression of feelings.  I strip away the bullshit that most infiltrators exploit.  The many adults that have imaginary friends have learned by watching many examples of what happens to people who don't keep their evil, ignorant, mysogenistic idiology to themselves.  \n\nAll belief is evil.  An infiltrator will laugh with his cop buddies quoting \"Scott is always right\", but you'll never hear them quote, \"All belief is evil\".  As a matter of fact I have it on good authority that they are stricly prohibited from quoting it, even in police reports.  I wonder if you can figure out why.\n\nThis is the only life you get.  I had mine planned out from age nine.  It never occurred to me that the Rule of Law would become corrupted too soon.  Before the year 2000, my only problems with the judiciary was their baffling technological ignorance.  \n\nI wish I'd prepared better for the collapse of the judiciary, but I work with what I have; and even my \"Plan B\" gives me a significantly better standard of living than all of you combined.  All of my actions from 2005 onward are to engineer what I like to call \"Destructive Benefit\".  Like THE TENDER FOR LAW itself all of my long-term plans eventually come to fruition.  You can look back to the older posts and see how foolish you sounded, and since you're on the rollercoaster, you don't really see how fast you're going.  There was going to be a stereotypical \"star pupil\" and a stereotypical \"class clown\".  They just turned out to be exactly opposite of who I thought they'd be.  So when it comes to predictions regarding people as individuals, I am rarely right.  I know how you'll all behave in large numbers, but individually you're all very confusing.  I have women figured out in a very \"low res\" way, but that's as close as I've ever gotten after years of study.  The little I do know is true; the rest is a big question mark for me; and whenever possible I try to engineer that gaping variable out of the equation.  It doesn't matter if you think I'm right or not, in the end...we'll all find out soon enough, just as we always do.  \n\nI think it's a safe bet that I'll be right again.  \n\nJason, if you're an infiltrator, go back to your masters and say you've been caught.  If you're not, then less speaking and more reading.  Pretend you're a Christian.  Pretend that if I discover your imaginary friend, you'll be banned; and all the benefit you get here, you'll just have to wait for.  \n\nI've been going through my vast video collection, and I've discovered what I think are videos of both Menard and Clifford acting all \"you're crazy\" and dismissing cryptographic currency.  Menard was sitting in the middle of a fucking mine when he was saying it.  I really like making people who oppose the right answer look really, really stupid.  That's something the cops and I have in common.  Anything you say will be used against you later on.  \n\nEveryone who hasn't watched the Naomi Wolf, End of America video, please do so now.  It's time to pick sides.  The days of warning are over.  It doesn't matter what you say/think/feel/believe.  Reality doesn't care; and very soon, neither will I, for you will no longer be of any use to me.  I'm giving you the keys to the future.  I'm giving you understanding now, and I ask nothing in return.  All I ask is that you share your knowledge with others.  Make sure they know how you learned, because then they'll know when they see an AQUILAE Battle Standard, they should stop what they're doing and walk away, knowing that by doing so they will never be harmed by anyone acting under that banner.  An example of the AQUILAE Battle Standard is on Lou Manotti's profile, and if you see it anywhere else you should stop whatever you're doing, and walk away - because shit's about to get real.  I'm talking about actual, real-life, bikini girls with machine guns.\n\nTake it away guys!","name":"Like THIS, only real!","source":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-QbZCPrvl0?autoplay=1","status_type":"shared_story","story":"Scott Duncan shared a link to the group: THE TENDER FOR LAW.","type":"video","comments":[{"id":"689333877769214","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404441440000,"message":":D"},{"id":"689332381102697","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404441032000,"message":"Well... there it is then."},{"id":"689333691102566","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404441403000,"message":"@Jason Moreland: Google advertisements reach 100% of their target audience and you only pay for those who viewed.

Since I don't want this post Lammi-fied (because there is GOING to be ridicule), I am posting this as Copypasta.\n\n****begin copypasta*****\n\nSTATE OF IN THE DISTRICT COURT \nFOR COUNTY \nSTATE OF Nevada \nV.\nYOU Case No. ___________________ \nLETTER ROGATORY FOR RELIEF \nUnder the Hague Convention Title 18 §1781\nI, John Doe, Executor for the JOHN DOE cestui que trust, to notice the Court of my Letter Rogatory to the YOUR COUNTY DISTRICT COURT, and demand my name be cleared of this alleged criminal case for the reasons set forth below:\n1) I, John Doe, have learned that this alleged Court that has scheduled a case/cause/claim against me is not really a court as per the Constitution of the United States, but rather a tribunal operated as a private corporation.\n2) I have learned of the fraud that goes on behind the scenes of these alleged criminal case , which are really civil claims in equity, and the steps taken to securitize these civil claims, without giving full disclosure to the people. I am hereby letting the court know that I am opting out of any contract and do not allow any documents regarding me or my cestui que trust to be securitized and sold to any investors etc.\n3) The fraudulent process is as follows: All cases are civil, though often fraudulently called criminal. The courts are operating under trust law, assuming the Defendant is a decedent. After finding the alleged Defendant guilty, the court clerks sell the judgments to the Federal Courts. Since the Defendant is a decedent, the court officials consider themselves as a beneficiary.\n4) When a judge asks if a person understands, he/she is asking if the person is liable for the bond. I am not responsible for the bond of this/these cases, but I will appoint the Judge as Trustee/Fiduciary and be the beneficiary of all proceeds.\n5) The judgments are stamped with something to the effect of Pay To The Order Of__on the back and taken to the federal discount window. The judgment now becomes a note.\n6) The notes are then pooled together and then become securities, which are yet pooled together and sold as bonds.\n7) Said bonds are liens against me.\n8) The United States Attorney’s Office has a put code number, NAICS (North American Identification Security Classification. Said NAICS number enables the United States Attorney’s Office to trade globally all securities.\n9) All US federal courts are registered with the DOD (Department of Defense), where they are registered with CCR (Contractor’s Central Registration), under the DOD, which another department called DLIS (Defense Logistics Information Service), which issues a cage code, which means a commercial and government entity, which everything corresponds with their bank account.\n10) Said United States Attorney’s Office and Courts have a Dunn’s number (Dunn & Bradstreet).\n11) Everything filed into court is securitized without the knowledge or consent of the people or of all parties.\n12) All criminal cases not heard in an Article 3 court (District Court of the United States) are really civil, however, the courts again commit fraud by labeling the case as criminal. All cases which are plead out or have a guilty conviction label the civil defendant (through unlawful conversion) as felons, when they are not. This is fraud upon the people at large, and certainly fraud upon the alleged Defendants.\n13) The Bank Account is at Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in New York City. The Depository Agreement is signed by the Clerk of Court.\n14) All securities are then deposited with the DTC in New York.\n15) An Escrow Agent is used as a go-between - between the Clerk’s Office and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n16) The securities end up being listed through the Seventh Circuit (Chicago, IL), then sent to the DTCC, the clearinghouse whom lists the securities for trading.\n17) All of the lawyers involved are acting a private debt collectors according to the FDCPA (Title 15§1692). The BAR Association exempts them from having to be registered as such; however, they operate through call warrants, which are like a put, or a call. Doing margin calls is where they convert a case through (similar to a Writ of Execution) use the case number to buy equity securities.\n18) Everything filed into court is securitized and turned into negotiable instruments, and then turning them into securities. These items are sold commercial items, calling them distress debts (Unifund). The items are then pooled together in what is now called a hedge fund, where they are sold globally.\n19) Anytime when there is risk management involved, it is for the securities. This is an underwriting company. When the hedge funds are going into the global market, they go through LuerHermes, a bond holder and underwriting company and subdivision of Alliance SE, of Munich ,Germany (Pimco Bonds).\n20) After 9 months, all paper is converted to a securities status. This is defined in Title 15§77(a)(b)(1) and an now considered to be an investment contract. The paper is endorsed to become a security, and the trust is then collapsed.\n21) The courts have an account with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) under Interpol. The Judges involved and the US Attorneys involved do not have an accessible Oath of Office , because they cover up the fact that the oath of office is between them and the IMF.\n22) The US Judges and US Attorneys are actually employees of the IMF and have expatriated out of the United States. They are now unregistered foreign agents under Title 22, which states all foreign agents must be registered.\n23) The court judgments are deposited with the IMF. Since this case obviously involves me, I have a drawing right to all proceeds. See UCC §3-305 and §3-306. The court judgments are monopolized according to Title 16, which is a violation of anti-trust laws, and also unfair trade practices.\n24) Indictments are True Bills, meaning they are negotiable instruments. The District Attorney failed to give me a 1099 OID showing me as the recipient of the funds, which is a fraud upon me. In my case, I have not been indicted, but still request a 1099 OID, unless the court wishes to close this account.\n25) The unlawful funds, through fraud and deception, are deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and they have not paid the tax on this income. According to the IRC, this is a §7201 of Title 26 violation (willful failure to file with the intent to evade the tax).\n26) A copy of the Depository Resolution Agreement was not made available to me from the Clerk of Court. The Clerk of Court makes deposits into the Federal Reserve Bank of New York via electronic funds transfers (EFT’s).\n27) The Clerk has a PMIA (Private Money Investment Account) is, which also has a government code. According to Clerks Praxis, the Clerk of the US District Court is the Registrar in Admiralty.\n28) According to the IRS §6209 Decoding Manual and the ADP (Automated Data Processing Manual), all 1099’s are Class 5 gift and estate taxes. I am asking for a 1099 OID in this case, as I am not willing to gift you the proceeds. I am hereby asking for the proceeds in their entirety, including interest.\n29) I have never pledged my rights or my body to any gifting program, including any court or court process.\n30) I am not a charitable organization. I demand all funds from the cases (current and past cases) be sent to me within 30 days or I will file complaints to the IRS and SEC explaining the fraud and theft committed upon me, and issue a 1099 OID.\n31) I demand my name and my cestui que trust name, John Doe/John S. Doe/John Smart Doe/ JOHNDOE/JOHN S. DOE/JOHN SMART DOE be removed from any and all government databases indicating bad credit, commercial liens and/or the titles of criminal, felon and/or convicted felon be removed immediately and permanently nunc pro tunc.\n32) I hereby request a copy of the Depository Resolution Agreement from the Clerk of Court. And a W-9 from the Judge and the US Attorney involved, if you wish to proceed with this case.\n33) I hereby notice the Court that I am the executor of the cestui que trust of JOHN DOE/JOHNSMART DOE. According to Title 26 §303 & §7701, companies, corporations, and associations and trusts are all decedents. This means my all capital letter name is a legal estate. My all capital letter name falls into this class. I direct all of the affairs and financial affairs of JOHNDOE/ JOHN S. DOE /JOHN SMART DOE.\n34) I demand this case/account be closed and no further steps taken to securitize it.\n35) I hereby ask the Court to notify local agents and agencies to put me on a do not disturb list so we do not have to go through this again.\n36) I am confident that the Court and its officers want to follow the law, and perhaps were unaware of the processes of civil and criminal cases.\n37) I expect no further harassment from rogue unregistered foreign agents.\nLETTER ROGATORY FOR RELIEF\npresented this the ____ day of ________, 2014.\n(_____Signature________________________)\nAuthorized Representative : John Smart Doe\nMail checks and correspondence to:\nPO Box \nLas vegas, Nevada 12345\n\n*****end copypasta****\n\n****BEGIN WITTY INSIGHTFUL CRITIQUE*****","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"686446578057944","comment_count":0,"created_time":1403842984000,"message":"was this a test? i only got to 4) before it started to hurt enough to skip to the comments.

The two choices the establishment gives you have slightly different rhetoric, but always nearly identical behavior. You can vote for narcissistic authoritarian collectivist A, or narcissistic authoritarian collectivist B. The fact that you have two \"choices\" doesn't make it any less ridiculous than, for example, Soviet Russia under Stalin, where the people had the right to vote ... but had one \"choice\" to vote for.\n\nIf, as ridiculously bogus as it is now (with what just happened at the DNC being only one example), you still play the game and vote, you are essentially proclaiming to the political masters that you will fall for absolutely anything--that it doesn't matter how transparently silly the circus gets; you will still legitimize the game and empower the establishment by \"choosing\" to be a slave, allowing them to keep telling you that they \"represent\" you, and that you \"consented\" to this.\n\n\"Well at least I'm doing something!\" Yes, you are doing something ... something stupid and counter-productive, while the tyrants laugh at your pathetic gullibility.

(Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nDerek Moran: ... a BILL is a TENDER FOR LAW.......did THEY, not TENDER it to ME??\n\nDerek Moran: HOLY FUCK- so theres no need to go through all this Liening of the Property Tax Account Statement-instrument they sent us even to begin with..just accept the TENDER FOR LAW they offered us by sending in the bill-payment-remittance they provided!!! (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nScott Duncan: TENDER=CONDITIONALLY OPEN TO OFFERS.\n\nIn this example I am going to use Gail Blackman.\n\nIf you go to our corporate mail server http://mail.cdd.com, you will see a TENDER.\n\nIn this tender you can use CASH, or \"Serviced\" for service.\n\nThere are conditions. If she wishes to offer one of these for my services, she must abide buy the conditions.\n\nIf she arrives at the table with empty pockets, she is aware that she must bend over that table and lift her skirt. Business has not commenced, even though she'd clearly \"means business\", by doing that.\n\nAfter she is \"serviced\", she is now qualified to avail herself of the services I offer.\n\n...all sexual performance after the terms of the offer are fulfilled is purely recreational, and has nothing to do with the tender... like a tip.\nServer - mail.cdd.com - NO COMMERCE EXPECTED and/or IMPLIED\nmail.cdd.com\nServer - mail.cdd.com - NO COMMERCE EXPECTED and/or IMPLIED\nmail.cdd.com\n\nDerek Moran: I know-HUH??...what are they gonna do- take you court??..\"You're the FUCKIN' guys who sent it to me in the first-place..i just accepted YOUR, OFFER!\" (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nScott Duncan: THEY TENDERED, YOU ACCEPTED.\n\nGail Blackman: hmm let's see if I'm getting this....I could present you with a counter conditional offer ? and is this what we are doing when we send money when we receive a bill? (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nScott Duncan: Yes... And I can reject the counteroffer, as I am the one who offered the tender. YOU would have to come to ME to do business. It's not COMMERCE as it is not an advertisement. YOU must SEEK OUT the tender.\n\nDerek Moran: As in, the City possibly saying- \"Oh no, we dont accept payment THAT way.\"....\"OH??..then WHY, did YOU, SEND it, to ME, in the FIRST PLACE???\" (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nGail Blackman: so people are trying to pay their bills A4V, when all they have to do is to return the bill stating they accept the offer/tender which is the bill? (Scott clicked LIKE)\n\nScott Duncan: Yes Gail.\n\nScott Duncan: Gail Blackman, what does the STAMP on a cancelled cheque mean?\n\nGail Blackman: accepted?\n\nScott Duncan: See? Easy, and you didn't even have to put out.\n\nGail Blackman: when sending it back..we simply write \"Accept\" on it? and if they question it, suggest they refer it to their legal dept?\n\nGail Blackman: the question would come from their own ignorance...like no one ever \"pays\" like that...im sure they are only used to counter offers of money?\n\nDerek Moran: GAIL- i have a friend who has Crawford and Falconbridge's Bills of Exchange book which he said says, all you have to print is ACCEPT at the top of the bill...'ACCEPTED-FOR-VALUE,' ACCEPT-FOR-VALUE, or A4V, is not necessary\n\nBeverly Girl-Brain Braaksma: And send it back to the offerer?\n\nDerek Moran: ..id take a photocopy of it before you registered-mail it\n\nGail Blackman: I agree..I'm talking more about accounts receivable clerks who would receive the confirmation of acceptance...and put you in the list for not \"paying\" and cut your services\n\nPete Daoust: You sent a registered mail envelop.??...how can they cut your service ???\n\nDerek Moran: The bank they ultimately deal with, will turn your $100 property-tax-bill-payment-remittance, into $2300 worth of credit.. credit the $100 back to the City.. leaving $2200 leftover for the bank to try and rule-the-world with even more with it\n\nDerek Moran: AND..........it all started with YOUR signature, they reverse-engineered everything we THOUGHT we knew about money\n\nScott Duncan: NO. You accepted the TENDER.\n\nThe dozy broad in accounts will escalate the issue to management. It USUALLY pays out like Derek describes.\n\nGail Blackman: I guess this is why they are soooo keen on automatic withdrawl to pay bills....they push it as a convenience for you but really it's for their own benefit...knew I never liked that offer\n\nGail Blackman: So I'm clear....all i have to do is write \"Accepted\" on the bill and return it registered mail?\n\nDerek Moran: ..there are a number of other things id do to it myself, Gail Blackman\n\nChad Brodgesell: @ Derek Moran, that's just 'fractional reserve banking though' isn't it?\n\nDerek Moran: Yup. Banks legally are allowed to counterfeit credit, basically. In Canada, the Fractional-Reserve-Rate/Ratio, is called either the CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENT, or the ASSET CAPITAL MULTIPLE. However, no promissory note-representing-debt + your signature = NO, CREDIT, for THEM. The rate is 23 in Canada, btw.\n\nChad Brodgesell: Nicely put. Was just checking cause we use different terms. I use general and you guys use the proper ones. This is how I approached the bank when I got my credit. I didn't know it was 23:1 though thought it was 12:1.\n\nDerek Moran: Barrons Law, BILL: a PROPOSITION or statement reduced to writing. In commercial law, an \"account for goods sold, services rendered and work done.\"\n\nDerek Moran: BILL(LEGISLATION): a draft of a PROPOSED statute submitted to the legislature for enactment.\n\nChad Brodgesell: I fired off a letter a while back asking the bank to clarify that it was my signature that created the credit to begin with and that on fractional reserve they had already been paid as their balance sheet would indicate and can they please send me a statement of account that was SIGNED by an authorized person. In 2 weeks time they had sold the account to a collection agency, never did get back to me. Not sure what I did was/is right but got them off my back.\n\nDerek Moran: BILL(NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS): Bills are all forms of paper money. see PROPOSITION, PROPOSED above\n\nChad Brodgesell: well that was like a year ago, but last week I fired off reg mail to the collection agency for them to produce a valid claim against me and if they could not do so then a charge of $10k for them to keep bothering me. I'll see how it goes.\n\nChad Brodgesell: This is the problem most of the time. Some stuff works but no one will verify WHAT it is that works.\n\nChad Brodgesell: Now I don't know what this is worth, but, EVERY time I ask for a SIGNATURE from who ever is whatever with me....the door slams shut.\n\nChad Brodgesell: I did get my former boss to ask the bank who was the GRANTOR of one of his buildings. Next week he told me he didn't want to talk about it.\n\nDerek Moran: CHAD- ask the bank for this: \"...for the original instrument of indebtedness in its original form.\"\n\nDerek Moran: The problem is, when we all opened-up a bank-account and never read the 10-page contract, they had language that apparently waived our right to discharge bill-payment-remittances in it. But, you cannot waive a right unless you did it with the express intent to.\n\nDerek Moran: on a financial instrument, you sign- 'without recourse'\n\nChad Brodgesell: Just asked for A SIGNED document back saying that (in my very fukked up wording) what I said wasn't true. I then found out they sold the account. m, can't say sold, they just called and said the matter had been 'sent' to collections.\n\nDerek Moran: \"the original instrument of indebtedness,\" is a promissory note, which considered to be the money you created with your signature.. and yes, they wont want to provide the original because its probably been marked-up from being Fraction-Banked, and evidence the bank has ALREADY been paid.\n\nChad Brodgesell: so, in essence thru basic general english I asked them to DENY that they already had been paid as soon as I signed,,on the dotted line.?\n\nDerek Moran: You know what- on second thought, someone brought-up a good point..not only do i think the SIN# doesnt have to be on the BILL-payment-remittance, like someone said, i think it would be construed as a tacit-agreement that you're a Government-employee by doing that...maybe Scott can verify that one way or the other\n\nKelleran Holman: Derek, does this notice then suggest that you agree that you are liable to a certain debt (it applies to you) to the Corp of Toronto, and now want to sort methods of settlement?\n\nDerek Moran: Good point.. they are not presenting it to Derek Moran.. they are presenting it to DEREK MORAN, they are just trying to get Derek Moran to act as SURETY for it\n\nDerek Moran: Kelleran- im doing this keeping in mind, that we do use the water..and they do pick-up our garbage-and-recycling.. this about enforcing the right to DISCHARGE debt, as opposed to PAYING them property-taxes with legal-tender from out of our pockets\n\nDerek Moran: I dont think it will make my fathers life easier for him by saying- \"Just tell the City you dont feel like paying taxes anymore\".. the City has given him the REMEDY, which is the bill-payment-remittance..im just trying to get him to wrap his mind around how credit is created\n\nDerek Moran: \"As I have already noted, a promissory note, by definition, involves an unconditional promise to pay a sum certain in money, but it is not itself money...there is no liquidation of the debt until it is DISCHARGED...\"\n\nhttp://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1977/1977canlii36/1977canlii36.html\nCanLII - 1977 CanLII 36 (SCC)\nwww.canlii.org\nBay Bus Terminal (North Bay) Limited and Bay Bus Terminal (North Bay) Limited na...See More\n\nJames Baal: Notice = valuable instrument = bill of exchange, exchange of what?

LeBlanc: James, One suggest reading the bills of Exchange act and the Bank act. Empower yourself.\n\nAdam Thomas: Yeah Jim. Do what jason says mate. Then it'll all fall into place. NEVER EVER PAY WITH MONEY ( legal tender) IN THEIR COURTS. Use a BoE instead PERFECT.\n\nAdam Thomas: ORDERS also come under BOE. Judge ORDERS ye to no longer bend over & clutch ankles. YOU AMEND THE ORDER YOURSELF. Fuck this stuff is sooo POWERFUL.... I wonder what would happen if it actually fell into the wrong persons hands ?\n\nDerek Moran http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/45-46/61\nBills of Exchange Act 1882\nwww.legislation.gov.uk\nAn Act to codify the law relating to Bills of Exchange, Cheques, and Promissory Notes.\n\nSonja Ruebsaat: can someone tell me more about how to go about this:\n\"Wise-man once said to get a STAMP made up for the back of any bill-payment-remittances you want to try using to discharge debt with... and what would that STAMP read, for it to be most effective exactly?\" I heard there is a stamp you can get made...connected to your bond...some sort of personal insignia and then you also write something on the bill/debt that it should be paid from your bond...\n\nDerek Moran: The STAMP, as i was told, is for the purpose of getting across the MESSAGE you want to CONVEY to the biller you're hoping has SOMEONE with the slightest knowledge of the purpose the bill-payment-remittance/coupon/voucher at the bottom of any particular BILL you are TENDERED from a biller is.\n\nDerek Moran: For instance- lets say a STAMP has room for only 4 or 5 lines on it...this is what I would put on MINE:\n\nBILLS OF EXCHANGE ACT, 1985\nsection 3. Thing done in good faith\nsection 9. Common law of England\nsection 57.1 Presumption of value (the most important one of all)\n“value” means valuable consideration.\n\nDerek Moran: If someone being paid a job to do on the other end doesnt understand any of this then that is not my fault..hire someone who is LEGALLY COMPETENT to deal with this. They TENDERED you a BILL, not to pay your debt, but, to DISCHARGE it, as PAYMENT of a debt is an IMPOSSIBILITY in lieu of GOLD being suspended-as-payment since 1933, and, you ACCEPTED it - what are they going to do, take you to court and tell the Judge that you had THE NERVE to ACCEPT what THEY tendered/OFFERED to you??\n\nDerek Moran: Apparently, what i was told, is that CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FUND=BIRTH CERTIFICATE, and BIRTH CERTIFICATE=CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FUND, and that the Consolidated Revenue Fund is actually mentioned in the Bills of Exchange Act, but, i was unable to find it.\n\nDerek Moran: Things i am fuzzy on were, where the STAMP goes on the bill-payment-remittance; the front, or the back. Another one, was that the bill-payment-remittance should be mailed registered-mail to THE BANK OF CANADA, as the Bank of Canada is the ONLY organization in 'Canada' that is able to create money/CREDIT from our SIGNATURE. They can do this, as the Bank of Canada as i understand it ultimately, is the one holding onto our SECURITY OF THE PERSON in their Clearing and Settlements House; not sure if that is exactly the TREASURY BOARD SECRETARIAT, or, CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. Another one was, register-mailing it straight to the Bank of Canada without the second-signature presumably from the biller already on it, as Scott has driven-home-the-point enough times that you MUST have TWO SIGNATURES (us, the biller), and, a TRUSTEE (the Bank of Canada); this begs the question whether or not it should be register-mailed back to the BILLER first for it to be the second-signature, then, they send the bill-payment-remittance now with TWO SIGNATURES into the Bank of Canada if they want to get 'paid.' (Scott clicked 'Like' on this)\n\nDerek Moran: Another important point was that it is the BILL, not the INSTRUMENT/REMITTANCE which is marked ACCEPT, but the BILL, meaning the upper-portion of the document NORTH of the perforated-edging-line you ultimately tear across. You DO NOT mark ACCEPT on the INSTRUMENT itself. You are ACCEPTING the BILL. Then, using the INSTRUMENT/REMITTANCE, to DISCHARGE, the BILL.

The front is the public side...\n\nDerek Moran: So FRONT=PUBLIC=GOVERNMENT side... BACK=PRIVATE=US/OUR side, hmmm interesting. I would've assumed as US being the first-signature, that it just would've been put on the FRONT of the instrument...\n\nScott Duncan: Look at any promissory note. It is always \"BACKED BY\" someone/something.\n\nAdam Thomas: Signature = SURETY.\n\nBlake Gardner: \"Backed by\" - \"indorsed\" = on the back of...\n\nAlso as far as two signatures go, look up the word mark & seal - mark/logo/letterhead etc., is considered as their mark/signature/certification. So the front of these presentments/instruments usually have such identifying marks...it's also the reason most corporate correspondence usually comes without a signature but a letterhead/logo or the like instead.\n\nDerek Moran: Ohhh ok, so Scott, this is what you meant by when you said register-mail the bill-payment-remittance straight to the Bank of Canada, because, the biller already has their MARK/SEAL/SIGNATURE on the front of the instrument/remittance?\n\nDerek Moran: What required of corporation\n\n5. In the case of a corporation, where, by this Act, any instrument or writing is required to be signed, it is sufficient if the instrument or writing is duly sealed with the corporate seal, but nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the bill or note of a corporation to be under seal.\n\nhttp://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-4/page-2.html#h-3\nPART IGENERAL - Bills of Exchange Act\nlois-laws.justice.gc.ca\nFederal laws of canada\n\nBlake Gardner: Remittance is money sent by one person to another, either in specie, bill of ex- change, check, or otherwise.\n\nDerek Moran: Corporate Seal for the City of Toronto, although, i dont ever recall actually SEEING this before, let alone on the bill-payment-remittances:\n\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_237.pdf\n\nDerek Moran: Another question is how exactly is the proper way to MARK a bill-payment-remittance for proper presentment-and-acceptance. Section 190. explains somewhat how a Consumer bill or note is to be marked. Other than that, as i understand it:\n\n1. Print ACCEPT on the face of the BILL-payment remittance\n\n2. the empty AMOUNT-BOX needs to be filled in..give'em a $10 tip so as to less of a reason to be mad with you\n\n3. your SIGNATURE (thats a biggy) on the BACK (think 'Backed by'), not front, the BACK of the INSTRUMENT/REMITTANCE\n\n4. putting WITHOUT RECOURSE after your SIGNATURE, just in case they want to scare you with some legalese-talk\n\n5. putting the DATE on it would seem like a good idea\n\n6. the STAMP/MESSAGE you want to CONVEY to them (not sure whether on front or back)\n\n7. ???????????????????????\n\nhttp://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-4/page-38.html#h-28\nPART V CONSUMER BILLS AND NOTES - Bills of Exchange Act\nlois-laws.justice.gc.ca\nFederal laws of canada\n\nChiefRock Sino General: man, what is everyone going on about here.

It (stamps) certainly have an assigned value. The basic unit I believe is $.02 U.S. this is the lowest universal standard for the minimum cost of a stamp. It is the most basic tender for law, your most basic payment for contract, because when governments fail some system must be in place that ensures exchanges can occur between peoples in the case old government failure and collapse so a new one can be reestablished . A system has to be in place (and is) where people can continue to do shit -like contract with each other, the basis of all shit, and have some universal system in place so that shit can get done, no matter what....including what currency. This is where a completely electronic currency would should and will come in place....for one thing...no borders. No empty Forts full of metals we rape out of the ground that are more available in countries that....without it....would contribute Jack shit to the global economy. Other than our fucking greed, gold, for example, like silver and copper....makes a great conductor for electronics and should be used and valued as such.\n\nAnyhow.... I get why sheeps dont get shit. See...it all begins with understanding that money is debt. They CANNOT admit that. Once you admit that the answer is very simple: get rid of money and you get rid of debt. And since most politicians talk about debt, youd be getting rid of the need for most of them. Most of the \"police\" people wouldnt be needed. Youd be getting rid of greed....like our greed for gold thats really just another fucking metal. That I don't believe in. But nooooo you cant get rid of money because money is debt and debt exists to fuel greed and getting rid of greed? there's too much money in that. Money....?

Utilization of stamps includes putting stamps on any documents (for clout purposes, not mailing) we wish to introduce into the system. As long as you use a stamp (of any kind) you are in the game. If you have time, resources, and the luxury of dealing with something well before expiration of a given time frame, you can use stamps that you consider ideal. The most preferable stamps are ones that are both large and contain the most colors. In an emergency situation, or simply if economy is a consideration, any stamp will do. Using a postage stamp and autograph on it makes you the postmaster for that contract.\nWhenever you put a stamp on a document, inscribe your full name over the stamp at an angle. The color ink you use for this is a function of what color will show up best against the colors in the stamp. Ideal colors for doing this are purple (royalty), blue (origin of the bond), and gold (king's edict). Avoid red at all cost. Obviously, if you have a dark, multi-colored stamp you do not want to use purple or blue ink, since your autograph on it would not stand out as well if you used lighter color ink. Ideally one could decide on the best color for his autograph and then obtain stamps that best suit one's criteria and taste.

Otherwise, it would've been FRAUD- why? Because even as part of the NOBLE LIE it states in Genesis 1:26 that WE were to be given DOMINION over all of the earth. 'God'/The Creator, did NOT make governments, or corporations, or corporations masquerading as government in HIS supposed-likeness and gave them Dominion over ALL of the earth, he gave it to US.

(Scott clicked 'Like')\n\nChad Brodgesell: Their Debt taken from Our Credit I think. They created the Note. It's theirs we just use it. So ultimately they created a promise to pay that only they can Pay or Default on. I think I got that right.\n\nAdam Thomas Chad, WHO IS NOW THE HOLDER OF THE DEBT ??\nHow do you find out?? They've only given you a Legal Fiction in FULL DISCLOSURE.\nThey sold the debt & been PAID AGAIN.\n\nBlake Gardner: It's a novation of sorts.\n\nAdam Thomas: Wtf Blake ?? How do I go about to find out who actually has the ALLEGED DEBT?\n\nBlake Gardner: It's of course us in the end, and we are in reality loaning money to ourself - private>public novation circle...however discloser is not a solution nor the point, imo...it's just another remedy in and of its self:-)\n\nYou can bank on the public never disclosing - it is a public's policy - thus you can bank on getting an unrebutted agreement to your contracts/offers every time and therefore, being able to hold them if they are, voluntary based and of reasonable expectation.\n\nAdam Thomas: All well & good Blake, but if they haven't the ORIGINAL CONTRACT then what's that make the situation ??\n\nBlake Gardner: A new offer makes the old offer moot...likewise a new contract agreed to makes the old contract moot.\n\nBlake Gardner Well I'm of the opinion it's meant to be...something for everybody...a public infrastructure with the option of guardianship (benefits for governance) or the private for those who prefer self governance.\n\nBlake Gardner: I'm pretty sure it can go on indefinitely, or at least as long as is desired or more importantly necessary. It's fiction - after all...new characters, stories lines and plots can be written in at any stage and consent manufactured to corroborate. (Scott clicked 'Like')\n\nAdam Thomas: Manufactured Consent.

I have used THE TENDER FOR LAW to effectively give you, and the rest of the world, a whole shit-load of NOTICE.  \n\nThree years is a long time, and many incredible things have happened; and it's all unfolding in different perspectives depending on how long you're known me.  People who have known me for decades are screaming, \"How the fuck could he have known?\"  Of those people, the farther they are away from computer science, the more likely they are to reach for the \"lucky guess\" option.  Others will try to make it seem as though I was somehow \"less right\"; or my personal favorite, \"You were right...so what?\"  The thing is that if you are having this quandary in your empty little head, it means there has already been a discussion, and you don't get to back-peddle, and say I was sort-of right; and in these coming days I will be expecting all of you to step-the-fuck-up when needed.\n\nThe Law Society is most frightened of the coming of 2016.  This is when I start selling my debts.  Like the Chinese buying trillions of dollars of worthless US debt, I have literally hundreds of people who owe everything that they are, and have, to me.  The price I exact in exchange is always a small one.  What is, or will be asked, may seem nothing to you - but it's everything to me - or I wouldn't have shown you how to get everything you wanted.  There are a disturbing number of people who think that they can diminish my role now that the debt is coming due, claiming to have \"done all the work\", and completely ignoring the fact that they would be no farther ahead without me.  Without me they would never have known the life they have now.\n\nIt's the strangest thing, but throughout my life I've encountered countless people who think it's acceptable to do these very things; but as I've also noticed, I'm prepared either way.  You just have farther to fall.  \n\nTo those who owe me a debt that I did not CONSENT to, you have until the end of the year to make reparations.  After that I shall sell the debt to any number of the aforementioned people who have become very rich using what I have taught them.  They are going to want to collect off of you, and when they do, remember - it's all \"perfectly LEGAL\".  \"There is a court order\", and they're \"just doing their jobs\", no matter how loud you may scream.  \n\nIn 2016 I go from privateer to pirate, and so do all my ships.  Guess what...we've prepared for that too.  Thereafter, I'll still be available.  I'll have to be.  I'll be providing a planetary-scale example of AGENCY.  Like the conductor of an orchestra I'm not playing any of the instruments.  I'm not making any noise, but you're not doing any of these things until I say so; and you will do them as, and how, I say.  \n\nI have demonstrated in the public eye what I am capable of, and if you look carefully you'll see I showed you how to do the same thing. I don't hoard power, I make sure everybody has it.  I've given you all you need to construct lifeboats for what is to come, and I'm off to build my \"Rocket to Utopia\".  \n\nTo those not paying attention, that was a 'Doctor Who' reference mocking the police.  This past year seeds were planted and companies sprung to life, all managed through AGENCY.  You couldn't connect me to them if you tried, but now I need more people using the new technology so I can blend in.  I need some plausible deniability, and a monopoly on knowledge does not serve me.  The 'war on wrong' is being waged on all fronts.  With each passing day, fewer and fewer of my first wave pioneers are calling me for direction.  They know what they're doing, and they know why they're doing it.  In fact I'm sure the last two queries were just some misguided attempt to make me feel relevant.  What I have given them consumes their life, so it is beyond their comprehension that I could be, and know, so much more.  I just smile and say, \"You've got your scales wrong\".  \n\nThose are my successes, but I have plenty of failures as well.  Whether not moving fast enough to keep up, or simply loving bullshit too much, the cause is irrelevant; and all of you are the same.  It's like there's some other teacher out there, telling you how to square it in your empty, little, heads.  You'll rationalize it with, \"I didn't waste his time; he wasted MY time\".  All of you say exactly the same thing, and if that's really how you want to rationalize it - that way, to protect whatever bullshit you love so much - then remember this public statement.  No matter what happens, you will never have moved one inch farther than the point at which I left you.  Then you can join the masses who say, \"There is no way he could possibly have known\", or \"It's just a lucky guess\"; but it won't protect you from what's coming.  I am still going to change everything!  Why do I know this with such certainty?\n\n...because I did all the work when everybody thought I was wasting my life - so much work that government plebes can't find it all. \n\nUnfortunately 2016 is also when people start taking me seriously, and that's all right too, because I'm already done \"building\".  Now the world is my playground, and if you see me playing in my sandbox, stay the fuck AWAY!  For, according to government \"intelligence\" I'm a \"mentally-ill computer operator\".  This suits me just fine.  I love the \"mental illness\" designation.  You see, that designation is a LEGAL designation.  No doctor has the AUTHORITY to declare you LEGALLY insane.  In fact, doctors only issue to the courts, opinions and recommendations; and here's the fun part.  \n\nIt all starts in the early days of C.P.I.C.  There are some technical terms I'm about to use here, and Wikipedia entries will be at the bottom.  Shortly after the Charter was enacted, rules were set for how \"criminal records\" were to be entered and/or stored.  So today's technical word that you're learning is \"schema\", a term you will hear often in conjunction with RELATIONAL DATABASES.  The combination of an application and a well-constructed schema, allows you to implement RULES for how the data is managed after it is created.  This means a designation such as \"mentally ill\" can have certain instructions attached to it.  This one has a very simple one; once you turn it on, you cannot turn it off.  This will make a notation on all \"criminal records\", and a set of three alerting asterisks bracketing the words, ***CONDITION: MENTALLY ILL***.  The reason I mention this is that it must appear in any DISCLOSURE.  The Crown is obligated by law to produce any exculpatory evidence, and a police record with \"CONDITION: MENTALLY ILL\" on it, means there is evidence I am not criminally accountable for my actions.  In fact, the reason it's in the Crown disclosure package in the first place, is to make it a FACT IN EVIDENCE - which it becomes when you ACCEPT the DISCLOSURE.  \n\n...I digress.\n\nThe point here is that, once you flip on the mentally-ill label, the very nature of how the data is stored negates the possibility of removing it.  In fact, all records of all police departments in CANADA, use the same standardized system - and it's hysterical.  Some clever entrepreneur knew that there was no better place to leverage ignorance than the public sector, and this \"guy\" manged to sell every surplus NeXT computer every built...and that piece-of-crap formed the backbone of police \"intelligence\" from 1990 onward.  I actually ACCEPTED an ARREST WARRANT in the WebCapades v. Duncan case, to get an idea of what they'd replaced it with.  This is why GOVERNMENT doesn't like me wandering around their buildings.  It takes me about ten minutes of casual observation to identify how every piece of technology works.  In short, around me, you've got no secrets to tell.  WebCapades v. Duncan was 2003.  I failed to ponder the Herculean ineptitude in play.  The stupid Gomer behind the counter was cursing because his early 90's NeXT station wasn't performing to manufacturer's specifications.  I kicked myself for a month.  A perfectly flawless reconnaissance presents real-world evidence that I have vastly overestimated my opponent.  It's a lesson none of us seem to learn.  We all have these interactions with LAW and GOVERNMENT thinking that just beyond the next supervisor, is somebody who actually has an idea what's going on, and this is not the case.  The DEPUTY DIRECTOR for the ATTORNEY GENERAL is only different from the douche at the counter at the ATTORNEY GENERAL's OFFICE in that one has maneuvered himself into a powerful position - the other has not.  So if you're looking for that smart government supervisor who understands all the issues, you're never going to find them.  People work for the GOVERNMENT (especially the ATTORNEY GENERAL) because they're not wanted in the real world.  Walk into any part of government service, any part, and I guarantee that there are at least three people related to one another there.  In these progressive days, their first language is from a country that speaks neither English nor French.  It's more diverse cronyism and nepotism; but they're all parasites.  Some of them know they're parasites and will make concerted effort to ensure the host isn't damaged too much, but in 2015 virtually every government worker thinks they have more rights than you do; and they think they own you, and that it's their \"LEGAL RIGHT\" to kidnap/harm/rob/murder you.  \n\nMy grandfather warned me about police states.  When he was explaining it to me, he was mostly concerned that I memorize the information for reference later.  I was thirteen and I didn't have much focus.  I was still young enough to answer my questions with, \"I need to learn more\".  I've always learned the most from finding the things that people who claim to have my best interests at heart, didn't want me to know.  Here's the thing about not being criminally accountable for your actions (which I was at thirteen).  It's very difficult to give up when the passage of some arbitrary date occurs.  Why did I go from the superior title of 'Master' to the subordinate title of 'Mister'?  Who made that decision?  It is dangerous questions such as this, that guided my entire course through life.  \n\nSo if you're fortunate enough to be \"mentally ill\", just remember it's the LEGAL NAME they're DECLARING mentally ill - not you.  This means you immediately CLAIM the RIGHT to ACT as AGENT for this \"mentally ill magic parchment\".  You can explain to the COURT how \"there's plenty of 'tards out there living really kick-ass lives\"; because if mental illness is a FACT in LAW, then it is FRAUD to attach SURETY.  The two things the COURTS MUST RECOGNIZE are MISTAKE, and FRAUD.  NOTICE OF FRAUD works exactly the same way as NOTICE OF MISTAKE, only instead of MISTAKE, it's FRAUD.  See how that works?  If FRAUD is on the RECORD, you cannot CONVICT.  FRAUD on the RECORD is, by it's very nature, REASONABLE DOUBT.  It is not reasonable to FORGIVE FRAUD.  The onus is always on you to show why you should not forgive MISTAKE.  The COURT is bound by this as well.  But the onus is completely reversed as regards FRAUD.  You are under no obligation to forgive FRAUD, and the onus is on the COURT to disprove FRAUD.  \n\nOne of the oldest tactics that the GOVERNMENT uses, they learned from the piece-of-shit Christians.  If you question authority, they call you 'crazy'.  So let them.  They are trying to diminish the value of the SECURITY in order to 'reclassify' you; except if you're smart you've already LIENED your name as recommended by \"Dan-Lien-Your-Name-Wilson\".  So not only is this SECURITY 'mentally ill', it's got a multi-million dollar LIEN on it.  There's not much equity we had here, and anyone who has LIENED their name, is by their very nature, going to put up a fight.  NOTICE OF MISTAKE is a passive resistance to the psychopaths in 'Thunder Dome', and those wanting to up-their-game in COURT can take their understanding of NOTICE OF MISTAKE and duplicate it with NOTICE OF FRAUD; let's see how this is handled when the BURDEN OF PROOF is on the COURT.  \n\nI hope this is a nice piece of civil disruption for you.  It's also where we're introducing what will become your greatest weapon - the 'Civil Disruption' domain.  It has been standing, waiting, since the late 90's: cdd.com.\n\ncdd.com won't do much at first.  It'll provide a few static pages and a few routing tools you won't understand.  It will, however, possess something that those who have been following WILL understand.  The Civil Disruption Domain will host a Diaspora Pod.  Some of you have been paying attention, and are lurking on Diaspora (don't think I don't see you).  Others forgot all about it.  Meanwhile a whole bunch of goodies have been developed in the back end, including, but not limited to, Diaspora wallets, Diaspora markets, Diaspora IPV6 gateways; and of course, for those on the Civil Disruption Domain, there will be their own personalized I2P Domain.  It is with the deepest, heaviest heart that I regret to tell you that \"Dan-Lien-Your-Name-Wilson.cdd.com\" is reserved so you can't use that one.  We're looking at a launch date in August, and here's the part that really makes me grit my teeth: only TENDER FOR LAW members can join!  I only need this site running for a year.  By then I2P addresses will be saturated and cdd.com will belong to everyone.  That's a blurry map for things to come.  After 2016 I am a hundred percent dependent on my fleet.  Many of the crew really resent how right I am, and have a lot of pent-up anger they wish to vent.  I cannot wait to leverage this resource.  In the meantime, pay attention to the technology I'm pointing you to, because these are just the real-world examples you can see.  If we're going to build a banking system that will collapse the current one, we need to make a system that's hard for them, but easy for us.  This will be my Alpha test of this plan.  That's right, I fully expect cdd.com to fail, because I'm giving it to you for free.  And, if I give you something for free in COMMERCE (that's what .com means), then you should know by now that it's free because you are the product.  Do what you will with the BENEFITS.  I just need people using it for the time that I'm using it.  My traffic needs to blend in with yours at this \"gateway\".  On the other side of that gateway you are completely anonymous and undetectable, unless you choose otherwise.  Everything you see on the internet today, we are going to build there.  We're constructing in his manner to control the infiltrators.  Once cdd.com is open enough for infiltrators to slip in, those of you who were here first will be able to spot them and remove their anonymity.  The internet will be \"policed\" by its users.  \n\nI learned a lesson a long time ago that Ellen Pao never learned.  A community is not a user base.  Community grows and forms.  We are going to grow and form a community based on knowledge.  We are going to give you choice again.  We are going to take the power out of the hands of the few, and we're going to give that power to you.  Personally I don't think you deserve it.  I think you should be the caged, regulated slaves the GOVERNMENT says you should be.  And that's an opinion that's worth more than any SUPREME COURT OPINION - and it's all irrelevant, because I will die knowing I kept my oaths, even to those not worthy of those oaths.  As my half century mark approaches, my only regret is all the magnificent work I did for all the wrong people.  The only way I'll ever overcome that regret is to create something even more magnificent.  What's coming is going to dwarf anything I've ever done before.  The best part is, even when I've slayed it all out in front of everyone, there's still nothing you can do to stop me; because I've created more debt than the GOVERNMENT ever stole from me.  \n\nAt this point in my life there are fourteen people who know I'm responsible for everything they have.  These are people that would take a bullet for me, and have said so; and they still know to this day that what I ask of them will be trivial.  A leap of faith, as it were, to you my debtors I say, \"What I ask of you will be nothing to you\", but at the time I ask it, it will be EVERYTHING to me.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if you understand how, just pay your debt.\n\nIt's 2015...WE ARE COMING!\n\nMentioned:\nhttp://www.cpic-cipc.ca/index-eng.htm\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"851971571505443","comment_count":0,"created_time":1436348372000,"message":"Do Diaspora accounts lapse?

Note: This all took place in French. So, these are legalese translations from memory, certainly not direct quotes.\n\nPIERRE DAOUST was called up.\n\nPete explained that he isn't PIERRE DAOUST, he's a man that happens to be the SOLE AUTHORIZED ADMINISTRATOR for the PERSON PIERRE DAOUST Inscription Number #####.\n\nJUSTICE: Ok Mr. Pierre. From then on they refer to Pete as Mr. Pierre.\n\nTwo other cases then went up before the court. After which, back to Pete.\n\nThe JUSTICE then started to read the 'instructions/rights'(not sure what to call it) out for 'Mr.Pierre' as he had 'chosen' not to have a lawyer.\n\nPete began to interrupt but the JUSTICE told him not to interrupt, so Pete let him continue.\n\nPete then insists that he doesn't UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. He points out that he WOULD hire a lawyer to provide the best possible defense to his PERSON, but he must first have access to the SURETY. WHERE IS THE SURETY?\n\nMostly blank stares from everyone. JUSTICE says that they'll get to that.\n\nPete continued to insist that he needs to know where the SURETY is, and doesn't UNDERSTAND.\n\nJUSTICE just repeats that they'll get that for him.\n\nPete says he needs it now.\n\nJUSTICE asks the CROWN if they've provided (Not sure about this, discovery or evidence). The CROWN says they have, so the JUSTICE turns back to Pete and tells him that their (discovery?) will include the SURETY.\n\nJUSTICE finished reading the 'instructions/rights', and asks the CROWN to call their first witness.\n\nCROWN calls the cop, and starts questioning him.\n\nPete interrupts, insisting that he doesn't UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. That this makes no sense. That his rights are being violated. That what's happening isn't RIGHT.\n\nJUSTICE repeats that they'll get to the SURETY part and insists that Pete sit down.\n\nPete keeps standing, and reiterating his position.\n\nThe Bailiff calls for backup, and begins approaching Pete.\n\nPete continues to insists that this makes no sense, that his rights are being violated, and that this makes no sense. He asks the approaching Bailiff if he's the JUSTICE's bodyguard or something?\n\nPete finally sits down when the JUSTICE further insists, and tells him he won't ask again. (Second bailiff arrives)\n\nCop begins testimony. Just running through all of the 'FACTS' about the night he intercepted Pete.\n\nPete objects many times during the testimony. Objections include:\n-He doesn't UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.\n-He doesn't have a lawyer here, and needs one to defend himself. He needs to know who the SURETY is to pay for one.\n-He himself isn't a JUSTICE, or a lawyer. This isn't his field/profession, so doesn't know what's going on.\n-The cop's testimony is inaccurate.\n-The cop is lying.\n\nEvery time Pete objects, the JUSTICE simply says that those aren't objections, they're more like comments, but that they're noted. As for the testimony being inaccurate, Mr. Pierre will have a chance to cross-examine.\n\n((I could easily be mistaken about this, as Pete doesn't remember it this way. But from memory:))\nPete said that he had no bad intentions. He then asked the cop if he thought Pete had bad intentions. He then sort of asked everyone if anyone thought he had criminal intentions.\n\nDuring that, Pete reiterated his position again.\n\nThe JUSTICE then admitted that the CROWN had NOT answered Pete's question as regards the SURETY.\n\nThe JUSTICE then asks Pete if he wants to recess(?) to have the time to find a lawyer.\n\nPete says that if they tell him who the SURETY is, then sure!\n\nThe JUSTICE then said that no one in the courtroom has any OBLIGATION to divulge who the party with SURETY is.\n\nFurthermore, he said that he will not ORDER anyone to divulge who the party with SURETY is.\n\nPete again reiterates his position:\nHe insists that he doesn't UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. He points out that he WOULD hire a lawyer to provide the best possible defense to his PERSON, but he must first have access to the SURETY. WHERE IS THE SURETY? WHERE IS THE INJURED PARTY?\n\nJUSTICE: There is NO INJURED PARTY. It is the STATE that is pursuing you.\n\nJUSTICE asks if Pete wants a new court date, to give him time to find a lawyer.\n\nPete asks for a few minutes to think about his answer. JUSTICE agrees.\n\nOnce back in court, Pete repeats again that he doesn't UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. He says that not having access to the SURETY to hire a proper defense for his PERSON is UNACCEPTABLE. For these reason, he asks that the case be DISMISSED.\n\nCROWN says that the testimony of the cop is evidence.\n\nJUSTICE says that to dismiss the case, there must be NO evidence, but the cop's testimony IS evidence, so case is not DISMISSED.\n\nJUSTICE asks again if Pete wants time to find a lawyer.\n\nPete says that he would like time to CONSULT with a lawyer.\n\nJUSTICE recessed for 10 minutes to decide, then agrees and grants Pete the time to find a lawyer.\n\nPro Forma date set for the 24th of August.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"1031652116870720","comment_count":0,"created_time":1468597833000,"message":"I really like to know the face of who we are talking about.

I have a lot to say about him, I was in Sweden when he actually asked to call me all the way from his expensive little penthouse in Toronto to sniff me out, let me digress and say that I guess because I am trustworthy, people tend to confide spontaneously, I don t ask questions, I find it rude....anyways, before this Scott flipped out on me 2 days later, the first phone call he called overseas at his own expense, we must have talked 40 mn, then he asked me to get skype ( I did and uninstalled it after the blow out and incidentally it had scrambled the PC I was in so bad I had to let a friend remote fix from the US, and even for her using logmein, and her expertise as an ex US force repair tech for PC circuitry outer space in orbit for their special satellites....she is retired, in the process she just about got her PC all fucked up too, the creep must have done soemthing, he is a PC programmer or something in those lines, besides his legal shit. Anyways, what I found out about him, is for one he is hiding behind a shady trust calles aquilae trust, in it was then Dean Clifford and Andrew Langevin, I saw andrew enter the penthouse on day two, on skype....the other thing is he told me they had 10K in the trust to take down Robert Menard....then that his goal is to re-instate the trust of the Monarchy, when I asked which Monarchy, he said Elizabeth, and went on on how of a hottie she used to be and how she upholds the Common Law, ok well technically I guess, but then he got on my case, giving me shit for all the notices I sent, I sent only 2, one to the receiver general saying I was voiding all my contracts, sin, citizenship and all, and why....( that part for a later conversation, or go to my about page and you will eventually find it ) the other was a 10 day notice, about me giving allegience to God, I dropped that one on the shores of the NSA, on a public board they admiister. Well Scott started flipping on me about God, and how tired he is of all these people with uimaginary friends etc, and when I started taking his argument down, he outright started calling me a cunt and screaming I just said goodbye and hang up on him. I knew them I was onto something, who the hell would call Sweden for 40 mn other than a high level rat. So I blocked him on FB, I blocked Andrew and Dean as well, Mika has kept Andrew on his list. I have warned Robert about this, now I am telling you, and I agree with you they are terrified of God, but I do have genuine atheist friends who threw the baby with the bath water, because of their hate for the hateful things religions have and are doing in the name of God, and I can t blame them, if they only knew they just threw the emergency exist key away, but hey there is not much I can do about it, most of them couldn t be bothered finding out their rights anyways, and I am tired of wasting my saliva, but yeah Mika is interesting, but when I look at his face type when his hair is short, he looks awfully like the special marching platoon of the rc's on Canada day and remembreance day....they all looked like clones when I saw them march in Duncan BC once, I couldn t beleive they had found so many men with the same skull structure, the lions with wide cheeckbones big heads, all sporting the mean look of vengence, strange parade that was. For the longest I used to admire Mika for at least speaking his mind, one day via Andrew the Greek fellow from Montreal who was in phone contact with me in 2012 and had Mika at his cousin s place for a bit, a visit that didn t end well, anyways I got to hear Mika's voice on the phone, and it wasn t anything I expected, it didn t fit the image, I could feel a lot of vanity in it, or something I can t really put a finger on, but although a nice voice, selfishness ? not sure wat it was, but love wasn t what I felt, we'll watch and see, good meeting you and John Spirit.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"536496406386296","comment_count":0,"created_time":1373761586000,"message":"We'll show up and it will be real cool, and Jim Morrison will say \"Oh fuck, ya.

Unless openly rebuked and rejected by stating clearly the matter is to be on the Public Record, the matter remains a private Bar Guild matter completely under private Bar Guild rules; and\n(ii) The Presumption of Public Service is that all the members of the Private Bar Guild who have all sworn a solemn secret absolute oath to their Guild then act as public agents of the Government, or “public officials” by making additional oaths of public office that openly and deliberately contradict their private \"superior\" oaths to their own Guild.

(and smiling like an idiot)\n\nGuess who very recently arranged to have an LLC organized in Delaware? ;)\n\nWarning: This is likely one of the longer posts ever submitted/posted here at THE TENDER FOR LAW and will almost certainly be the longest post I will ever make/submit.\n\nMy head is spinning at all the legal possibilities. They seem endless almost. \n\nI have many questions and have to go revisit/find some old threads so I'm not too much of a pain/shit smearer, but I thought I'd post this and a few questions and \"curious\" observations for now.\n\nMy main goal/objective is to create an AFTER document, with the document provide below as the BEFORE document. My hope is that as a group we can together transform this very ordinary and average template (an average boat not much better than a dingy) and using what we have learned here, transform it into a thing of beauty - a magnificent rough ocean worthy \"battleship\" capable of taking on the most formidable opponents and coming out on top.\n\nI'm thinking it might be a good idea to create two kinds of members. Some with more \"rights\" than others (such as voting rights) so as to protect the company from sharks that may get on board. I'd like one of my person to have the power to toss anyone overboard that might endanger the sheep or attempt to steer it in a direction I don't approve of. I want to be the ADMIRAL and make sure I remain the Admiral as long as I want to be. [Yet some of those things seem to conflict with my ethics/or programming (unsure which in some cases)].\n\n******\n\nI humbly suggest it could be FUN FOR EVERYONE and a great way for the newbies to put together the gold nuggets and help them get rid of a bit of the confused look they likely have on their faces all day long.\n\nI know it is a lot of work, but think of all the fun we can have while doing it. :)\n\n******\n\nThe Scoop:\n\nI hired a corporation down there to assist me with the process.\n\nAn AGENT of theirs submitted an application indicating the INTENT to be an ORGANIZER of an LLC in the STATE OF DELAWARE and provided A NAME for the new PERSON to be created. FIAT currency was given to pay FEES. \n\nThe SECRETARY OF STATE then IDENTIFIED the AGENT as the ORGANIZER of the LLC and provided the ORGANIZER a CERTIFICATE OF FORMATION from the SECRETARY OF STATE. It has two numbers, a FILE NUMBER and another number with SR in front of it. (? guessing State Registration) :/\n\nIt appears that the very next thing that the AGENT did was CREATE SOME LAWS. :) They sat at their computer and typed out a few of them (most likely a template) in a document they created and titled INITIAL RESOLUTIONS wherein her PERSON OPERATING AS an ORGANIZER of the LLC indicated her wish to RESOLVE some things. \n\nBUT, before those things could be resolved, as the ORGANIZER with SIGNING AUTHORITY, her PERSON had to state that she wanted to ADOPT a few things - these things called RESOLUTIONS.\n\nSo, then her PERSON resolved to RELINQUISH SIGNING AUTHORITY to the MANAGERS LISTED. Then this ORGANIZER resolved to name names and named me MANAGER of the LLC and signed this LEGAL document that stated that my PERSON will SERVE as MANAGER. (Isn't that nice of PERSON?) BUT, there is a catch, my PERSON will only SERVE as MANAGER until \"the Members(s) vote otherwise.\n\nHere's the other things this organizer RESOLVED in this one page legal document with a whole bunch of LAW in it that the ORGANIZER just made up.\n\n2) The DATE, the STATE, the ASSIGNED filing number.\n3) That the COPY of the ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION is COMPLETE.\n4) That the general PROVISIONS of an OPERATING AGREEMENT be ADOPTED and included as OFFICIAL RECORDS of the LLC. If the MEMBERS choose to adopt a more detailed operating agreement, then it will take precedence \nover general provisions in the ORIGINAL operating agreement.\n5) The MEMBERS have formed (not my person which hired the agent/organizer-not me ACTING as a PERSON/MANAGER of the LLC) the LLC, and (get this) THEY (still not one of MY PERSONS :/) are ENTITLED (ooh that sounds like someone who is privileged) to the FULL EXTENT OF THEIR LIMITED LIABILITY pursuant to State Law. (Somebody who has never lied to me told me that Delaware would be his choice if he were going to start an LLC because it's the best place IN THE WORLD if you enjoy LIMITED LIABILITY and want a lot of it)\n\nAnd talk about LIMITED LIABILITY, #5 goes on to say that even if the MEMBERS (utterly and completely) FAIL to MAINTAIN FORMALITIES of an LLC they are still entitled to all the LL anyways (isn't that nice). \n\nSo I guess that if a MEMBER gets some maple bacon grease on some documents, or loses some, or has to use some important documents to wipe their ass with because they run out of toilet paper, it's not a problem as far as the STATE of Delaware is concerned. \n\nMy person also received a blank template entitled LISTING OF MANAGERS and another template (i'll post a pic of it when I get a chance), namely a LLC MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE. \n\nIt looks like it's printed on that stuff that is often referred to as \"BOND PAPER\" and, to be valid, and, or, complete, it requires signatures in a few places by people with different TITLES. \n\nIt also appears to me that even though this CERTIFICATE looks like a MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE, it's not a MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE until the LLC CAUSES (\"caused this certificate\") \"to be EXECUTED by its MEMBERS\", or it can be BOTH a MEMBERSHIP CERTIFICATE and a SHARE (until it's cut along a provided dotted line).\n\nHere's where I am a still confused (i am likely being an idiot), as far as I can tell, the LLC doesn't have any members yet. It had an organizer who resolved to name me a MANAGER with signing authority. But no MEMBERS in sight anywhere. \n\nI guess my person had better MANAGE this since it's the manager of this \"MANAGER MANAGED\" LLC. \n\nFor clarification, the top portion of this certificate seems to require the following fields filled out:\n\nLLC NAME, Where it was organized, Total amount of members at X date, What PERSON is (is being) CERTIFIED to be a MEMBER,\nWhat % of INTEREST they HOLD (stating that they are ENTITLED to FULL BENEFITS of such memberSHIP), Date, and two final fields : Named Member and witness AND/OR member\n\n(not sure if it is noteworthy but the title of the final fields is exactly as written - i capped the AND/OR - with a capital N and M while the other field employed a lower case w and lowercase m)\n\nI see that the witness and/or member must sign, and I conclude for now that the Named Member field does not require the new members signature, but should be written in all caps. It could be another LLC person after all.\n\nHere's my first question, and if it's any consolation I feel stupid asking it... What MEMBERS are there that could cause another member to be named? It seems like the chicken and an egg riddle. \n\nAs a Manager, I need to find some \"members\" to EXECUTE this certificate so the LLC can get its very FIRST member. \n\nI'm guessing that since I now have signing authority as the Manager, that I can now create a RESOLUTION resolving to make my PERSON be known, identified, recognized as a MEMBER and/or MEMBERS, print my PERSONS name in the second last field (Named Member) and sign the last field as a \"member\", or get someone else to sign it as a witness. I'm probably complicating things here and need one of those zen ruler swats in the head. :/\n\nEnough of me blabbing...here is my little dingy they sent my person that was just put in the seas of commerce on the shores of Delaware...\n\n***************\n\nLIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OPERATING AGREEMENT\n\nThis Company Agreement of this MANAGER MANAGED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY organized pursuant to applicable state law, is entered into and shall become effective as of the Effective Date by and among the Company and the persons executing this Agreement as Members.

Exiting member must show that potential purchaser has full certified funds, or the ability to get full certified funds before the first right of refusal period starts. Current members have 60 days to buy exiting members interest if they so desire. \n(c) Pursuant to the applicable law, current members may unanimously approve the sale of exiting members’ interests to grant full membership benefits and functionality to the new member. The current remaining members must unanimously approve the sale, or the purchaser or assignee will have no right to participate in the management of the business, affairs of the Company, or member voting rights. The purchaser or assignee shall only be entitled to receive the share of the profits or other compensation by way of income and the return of contributions to which that Member would otherwise be entitled. Exiting member must disclose to buyer or assignee if current members will not approve the sale. \n7.2\nVALUATION OF EXITING MEMBERS INTEREST. If a member wants to exit the LLC, and does not have a buyer of its membership interest, exiting member will assign its interest to current members according to the following set forth procedures:\n(a) A value must be placed upon this membership interest before assigned. \n(b) If exiting member and current members do not agree on the value of this membership interest, exiting member must pay for a certified appraiser to appraise the LLC company value, and the exiting members’ value will be assigned a value according to the exiting members’ interest percentage. \n(c) The current members must approve the certified appraiser used by exiting member. Current members have 30 days to approve the exiting members certified appraiser. If current members disapprove the certified appraiser, they must show evidence to support their disapproval of the certified appraiser as a vendor qualified to make the LLC business appraisal. Current members may not stall the process by disapproving all certified appraisers. \n(d) Upon completion of a certified appraiser placing a value on the LLC, a value will be placed on exiting members’ interest according to exiting members’ percentage of membership interest. \n(e) If current members disagree with the value placed on exiting members’ interest, current members must pay for a certified appraiser to value the LLC and exiting members’ interest according to the same terms. \n(f) Current members’ appraiser must be completed within 60 days or right of current members to dispute the value of exiting members interest expires. \n(g) Upon completion of current members certified appraiser, the exiting member must approve the value placed on exiting members’ interest. Exiting member has 30 days to approve this value. \n(h) If exiting member does not approve current members’ appraiser value, the value of the LLC will be determined by adding both parties’ values, then dividing that value in half, then creating the value of the exiting members’ interest according to the exiting members’ percentage of membership interest. \n7.3\nDISTRIBUTION OF EXITING MEMBERS INTEREST. Upon determination of exiting members’ interest value, the value will be a debt of the LLC. The exiting member will only be able to demand payment of this debt at dissolution of the LLC or the following method:\n(a) LLC will make timely payments. \n(b) LLC will only be required to make payments towards exiting members’ debt if LLC is profitable and passed income to current members. \n(c) LLC must make a debt payment to exiting member if LLC passed income of 50% of the total determined value of the exiting members’ interest in one taxable year. \n(Example: If exiting members’ value was $100,000 and current member(s) received $50,000 taxable income in the taxable year, the LLC would owe a debt payment to exiting member. If current member(s) only received $90,000 in passed income, there would be no payment due.) \n(d) Debt payment must be at least 10% of the value of the passed income to current LLC members. \n(e) LLC must make payment to exiting member within 60 days of the end of the taxable year for the LLC. \n(f) Payment schedule will continue until exiting member’s debt is paid by LLC. \n(g) If LLC dissolves, exiting member will be a regular debtor and payment will follow normal LLC dissolution payment statutes. \n(h) Exiting members’ value of membership interest it assigned current members may NOT accrue interest. \n(i) LLC can pay off amount owed to exiting member at any time if it so desires.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"1031257180243547","comment_count":0,"created_time":1468539627000,"message":"I can turn it into a one line proposition. :D...\n\nLet's fix this and everyone can benefit and learn.

For the purposes of this article, there are no purported \"gurus\" in this forum, Christians believe they have an invisible companion, and money is a TENDER FOR LAW.  On a personal note, theists could, I suppose, park their imaginary friends at the door, but as the saying goes, \"If you believe that, you'll buy these shoes\".  That level of credulity, which by its very nature permeates every aspect of your existence, simply does not coexist well with critical thought.\n\nAlthough all of these things are connected, only one of these things interests me today - money as LEGAL TENDER.  I'm really confused as to why this concept seems so difficult to the average person.  Our lives revolve around the concept of tenders.  \n\nBasically, a tender is an offer that can be accepted or rejected.\n\nFrom childhood, we put out tenders for affection, acceptance, or stuff, to our parents and strangers, by being cute, or funny, or disingenous.  If the \"cuteness\" is accepted we may get affection, candy or a new bike.  In this system we are subject to the whims of these adults, their oversight and their rules.\n\nIn adulthood we continue to put out tenders for affection, financial or material gain, and even copulation.  Here too we have made the transition to bigger acceptance and better toys, and are now subject to larger oversight and different rules.\n\nIf someone \"offers\" you a flower on the street, you'd better believe it's a tender for pointless conversation or a \"charitable donation\".\n\nIf you're a woman sitting alone in a bar and someone sidles up to you and offers to buy you a drink, what you're really dealing with is a TENDER for SEX.  In this country at least, there are penalties for simply forcing yourself on another person.  You can, however, raise a tender with dinner, a drink, a fur coat, or a trip to Disneyland; and few people are ultimately confused at the expected outcome.\n\nWhy then should the concept of LEGAL TENDER be so obtuse?  Money is something you don't own, and didn't make.  In fact you can't make it - it's a closed system.  You can possess it or use it (see debt in transit), but only if you observe the terms and conditions set by others (not you again) for its use.  The fact that everyone uses and values it, doesn't make availing yourself of this luxury any less a tender.  If you \"owned\" the money you could set your own terms and conditions for its use.  As you don't, the terms and conditions are set by other controlling entities.  By using others' property you agree to be bound by certain rights and obligations - why else would you be participating in this system?  The use of institutionalized money benefits you when you colour inside the lines, and makes you accountable for non-performance when you don't.  There is, in fact, a fairly mature and far-reaching web of systems all working in concert to reward or punish depending on the profit you generate, and how well, or poorly, you perform.\n\nLet's look at a practical example.  If I have a car, and I let you use it, I might tell you that it must be returned in pristine condition, or with a full tank of gas.  Those are just some of the terms I might set.  I might tell you to pick up my aunt Flora at the doctor's office as well.  If you agree to the stipulations I have set, you can accept the loan of the car.  Let's say you forget to collect aunt Flora, and return the car on empty with garbage in the back seat.  I might be angry, I might want you to pay for cleaning the car, or I might send burly men to beat you up.  The only sure thing is that it's probably the last time I'll loan you the car.\n\nUsing conventional money has benefits, no doubt about it.  It's more convenient than working directly for food or shelter, and more socially acceptable than bringing a chicken or pig to exchange for a new outfit.  People have been conditioned to believe that money makes you happy, money buys everything you need, and money offers you legal protections that not-money never could.  \n\nIt's hard to solicit a tender for affection, and one drink may not be an adequate or enforceable tender for sex.  But money...different thing altogether.\n\nCaveat emptor - you'd better read the oh-so-tiny writing on every bill.  For money is a TENDER FOR LAW.","type":"status","comments":[{"id":"689309167771685","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404437357000,"message":"...I've never experienced it myself, but I'm sure I'd hate being wrong too."},{"id":"689311057771496","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404437825000,"message":"Seriously though, the whole money is 'debt in transit' concept reminds me of a story I read/heard about the snipers picking off soldiers in the trenches in World War 1:\n\nIf I remember correctly, soldier 1 lights a cigarette, takes a drag, passes it to soldier 2, takes a drag, passes it to soldier 3, taking a drag...BOOM!\n(the cigarette can be likened to the debt in transit)\n\nSoldier 1 & 2, only harm is some ingested carcinogens and some brain, blood and bone fragments on them, but soldier 3, he suffers the full liability...\n\nThat's the way I think of LEGAL TENDER notes these days :/"},{"id":"689308637771738","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404437194000,"message":"Ummm, I hate to have to suggest a correction or amendment, but wouldn't that be 'LEGAL TENDER= A PEANUT BUTTER' Theory? :P"},{"id":"689302927772309","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404436414000,"message":"'You can possess it or use it (see debt in transit), but only if you observe the terms and conditions set by others (not you again) for its use.'\n\nIt doesn't get much simpler or more profound than that!\nThank you Tara Duncan"},{"id":"689347027767899","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404444247000,"message":"...unless in the context of logical fallacies."},{"id":"689303441105591","comment_count":0,"created_time":1404436504000,"message":"TEACH THE CONTROVERSY!

Dean's name is Trust property, thus giving the man that you know as Dean Clifford a great number of options the rest of you don't have.  He doesn't use the Trust like a bank machine, he doesn't abuse any of the authority that any Trust title gives him, and he has the personal knowledge that he's not on his own if he has to “get the fuck out of Dodge”.  That's where the consensus ends amoung us.  \n\nDean's teachings on Trust Law are accurate, concise and accessible.  For some reason it's worth it for him to give everything he teaches those qualities.  \n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI'm not a super-genius, and I don't possess any mental powers that you don't.  Any discussion and/or engagement with me starts off with the reality that you ALL THINK WRONG, and YOU ALL VALUE THE WRONG THINGS!  This does not serve you when you are up against reality.\n\nThe sad part is that most of you are too old to change; and as I've demonstrated here in this little forum,   none of you can tell the difference between what's true and what feels good.  I know what you're experiencing.  Whether from Dean, or from myself, the time always comes when you read something that one of us writes and you KNOW that it is true; but you take no further time to understand what is being told to you.\n\nFortunately Dean Kory has provided us a working/living example of what happens when all of the above factors are in play.\n\nThe first obvious mistake that Dean Kory is making is that he is combining what Dean Clifford teaches with what I teach.  For the purposes of this article I'm going to dumb the two positions down so you can make the comparison.\n\nDean Clifford is all about being left alone, and when he's not left alone, he is about calling “them” to account.  \n\nI'm not like that.\n\nI am descended from the very people that put all of this in place.  Entire stereotypes about Scottish people exist to misdirect.  Most will tell you that Scotsmen are “cheap”, when in reality we are conservative about when we engage in commerce.  You have but to look at England's and Scotland's history to see why this is true.  \n\nThe very name of this group, THE TENDER FOR LAW, is all about that mysterious phrase, “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER”.  \n\nI'll be the first to admit there are a great number of benefits to be enjoyed in commerce, when everybody plays by the rules.  As I'm sure everyone is sadly aware of, by now; Nobody is playing by the rules anymore. \n\nTrying to “fix the system”, or call them to account in their own system, is simply “appealing to your rapist”.  It baffles me that anyone would think this is sound thinking.\n\n...I digress.\n\nAs I'm in a unique position to “follow the money”, I can determine who needs to pay the price for the royal screw-over we've been given.  As I type this, a team of system's engineers (and trained monkeys) are preparing for you, the reader, a step-by-step guide for cleaning out every financial institution that touches these shores.  The only price that I ask for this knowledge is that you pass it on to others.  Pay it forward...and get paid at the same time.  Who else offers that shit?\n\nI am many things.  I am prorogued Nobility.  I am a published author.  I am a composer.  Above all...the thing that forms the core of who and what I am, is that I am a computer scientist.  Those who have taken the time to actually listen to me, will recognize many “Scott-isms”; and the phrase “COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING” is repeated almost as often as my Number 1 “Scott-ism”, “THE MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG.”  You ignore these two truths at your own peril. \n\n...and reality does not care what you “believe”.\n\nThis lengthy preamble is to drive the next point home.  \n\nDO NOT TRY TO COMBINE DEAN'S METHODS WITH MINE.\n\nThere is no remedy in fraud.  There simply isn't.\n\nIn many ways I long for the old days where those who breached the PUBLIC TRUST were hauled into the street and thrown into an angry mob.  Authors have mistakenly used the term, “Hanging Judge”  as a term for a judge imposing strict penalties; but if you look through actual history, and not the crap you were taught in the Public Fool System, “Hanging Judge” refers to a judge who has abused his power and has been hung for the abuse of that trust. He gives sentences he should be hung for; HANGING JUDGE. You never hear the phrase “hanging JUSTICE” ;) This is odd, as there are so many of them. :D  ...I know. Digressing. I get it.\n\nWe don't have Judges any more, in Canada.  A judge traditionally was a trusted individual who could uphold the PUBLIC TRUST.  “We the people” no longer get to decide who is worthy of that trust.  People confuse the role of “judge” with the current role of “JUSTICE”.  It is important to know the distinction.\n\nJUSTICE is actually a “doing-business-as” name for a Crown Corporation.  It actually says, in the Dunn and Bradstreet listings “Government of Ontario Operating as JUSTICE”.  It has been like that, IN VARIOUS FORMS, since 1982.\n.\n..I'm sorry you missed it.\n\nThat is what you're dealing with, and you have ONE unalienable RIGHT; THE RIGHT NOT TO CONTRACT.  \n\nMy position is a lot closer to that held by Irene Gravenhorst, than it is to Dean Clifford's.\n\nSo, let's cover what Dean Kory is doing wrong! :D\n\nI notice a lot of “Clifford-isms” in what Dean Kory is clearly attempting to say; but all of Dean Clifford's methods depend on what I like to refer to as “Clubhouse Rules”, and every time you do this you're pretending to “be in the club”.  The natural response to somebody doing this is very similar to the response to somebody saying they know more than I.  In case you haven't noticed I smack them down in the most humiliatingly, and public way possible.  “Their” reaction is going to be much the same...we're all human after all.\n\nNOTICE OF MISTAKE (like the cheese) stands alone.\n\nIt is the only issue you should be concerned about! NOTHING ELSE!\n\nSERIOUSLY! Accepting discussion about anything else, is a FUCKING NEGOTIATION.  All of you are not seeing the forest through the trees.  This is why I say Dean Clifford's position is flawed.  He believes the tree can be pruned to look pretty again, when in reality it needs it's roots burned out, and it's limbs chopped up for one of Sir-Mica's gassifiers! The fucking tree is dead!\n\nUNDERSTAND?\n\nThe tree is dead!  \n\nIt's filled with parasites and rot, and the parasites are trying to keep the illusion of a tree standing.  For the past two years I have been feeding them the rope, at my own expense, and with violence inflicted upon me, so that any argument contrary to my position is immediately nullified.  IT IS/WILL BE, CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE that you are NOT getting what you are entitled to, given the burden of surety you have carried!\n\nUnlike THE MAJORITY of your “sources of truth”:\n\nI'm not one of these people that wants to drive without a licence.  \nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their mortgage.  \nI'm not one of these people that don't want to pay their taxes.  \nI DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE I FUCKING PROMISED TO!\nI am, however, someone that possesses knowledge and skills that the government finds/found essential to their expansion.  In my youth I gave our erstwhile government a tool, which all of you pay the price for today; and I was rewarded handsomely.  I patted myself on the back, and strutted around, knowing that I was smarter than everyone else, and never once paying attention to the harm I had caused.\n\nIn compliance with an oath I took a long time ago, I must atone for that; and that's the only reason you, the reader, even know that I exist.  \n\nI need to remind you again, that the only reason I'm here, is that I promised to be.\n\nNone of you have value to me.  You're not qualified to.\n\nI have a lot to teach you, and we are barely getting started; but I am not responsible for the shit that goes wrong when you try to take what I teach you (“REALITY”) and you try to jam it into your idiotic, unqualified, belief structure.  As I write that sentence I wonder how many of you have actually pondered that other “Scott-ism” you frequently hear; “ALL BELIEF IS EVIL.”  If you believe something, you will stop questioning it; you will stop investigating it, and you will never ponder if, and why, it's true.\n\nShould you believe something, that just happens to be true, you won't look any further – and that's a problem.  \n\nSo I want everyone to keep the following in mind.  All the sources you are investigating tell the truth about the law, but there are pitfalls!\n\nEverything Robert Menard says about the law is true.  It's what he doesn't say that's the lie.  If you want quick confirmation of this simply ask him what, “This note is legal tender” means.  If he tells you the truth (he won't), ask him why he's constantly “begging” for that very same TENDER FOR LAW that contains the ACTS and STATUTES that he claims don't apply to him! THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER is a TENDER FOR LAW. If you BENEFIT, then you have OBLIGATION!\n  \nEverything Dean Clifford says about the law is true, but how he chooses to apply it, is not; because there's still a lot of “belief” running around in his head.  He still believes he can “beat them at their own game.”  He will proudly point out their public and blatant violations... His evidence is irrefutable and conclusive. His rights are violated by those TRUSTEES of the PUBLIC, and then he tries to seek remedy from those same trustees! REALLY? \n\n...and then says the remedy, is to go to those very same people and “sue” them..in the very same courts that violated his rights. (What?)  ...Oh that's right, those are DIFFERENT courts, with DIFFERENT\n “Doing business as” JUSTICES. (WHAT?)  ...well, I'll just let you work out the flaw from there. If you can't, then you are too stupid to be reading this, and you should kill yourself.\n\nFeel free to try it this way. It's NOT “wrong”, but it ignores the fact that those who hold the PUBLIC TRUST, ARE wrong. Another “Scott-ism” is my position that NONE OF YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT FEELS GOOD! Following Dean Clifford's methods WILL drive this point home, so it's not a COMPLETE waste. ;)\n\nWell then...back to Dean Kory.\n\nRumour has it, through the grape vine, that the erstwhile Mr. Kory has been and/or will be, a guest on Global C.R.A.P. Radio, hosted by the redoubtable Tony “guy-with-a-dick-in-his-mouth” Butros.  This promises to be an exciting show, and I cannot wait to miss it.  I eagerly anticipate the thrill of not consuming time I'll never get back.  \n\nInstead I'll put something useful here – advice for your next court room appearance, Mr. Kory.\n\nWhen you're in the court room dealing with these babbling, sacks-of-shit, learn to use the breaks.  Repeat after me, “I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS”.  If they ignore your question, then your next response should be, “OBJECTION.  If the court cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.”  Keep repeating that, and repeating that, and repeating that...until they answer your fucking question.  \n\nI listen to you in court, Dean Kory, and I picture a girl screaming rape while slipping the condom on the rapist.  I notice the distinct lack of that phrase in ANY of your recordings, so repeat it in your head, “Objection.  If you cannot answer my question, then I do not understand the nature and cause of these proceedings.”\n\nApply THE TENDER FOR LAW Rule to this.  I choose my words very, very carefully, because I know what they mean.  You, the reader, seem to believe there's a library in your ass, because that's demonstrably where you keep pulling your answer out of.  If you see me using a phrase that should be used in court, the very first thing you should do is follow my rules.  Look up every single word, even, no scratch that, ESPECIALLY, if you THINK you know what the word means.  As the regular reader for THE TENDER FOR LAW will tell you, you most certainly don't.\n\nDean Kory reserves his rights, and then doesn't know what the fuck to do with them; but that's ok, because there are plenty of other people in the court room that know what to do with Dean Kory's rights.  \n\nOne thing Dean Kory should learn is that he is most certainly not Dean Clifford.  Make no mistake, it doesn't matter if I disagree with Dean Clifford's methods.  The fact is, I understand them.  What Dean Clifford is doing is beyond your current level of comprehension.  He is not joking when he says that everything he says and does, is part of a larger plan.  I disagree with Dean Clifford's position and methods, because he pays too high a price for the sake of worthless people; but he's doing it for all of you, and not just for himself.  I will admit statistically, this does skew the numbers in his favour; because in the end, Dean Clifford is like you.  You all think wrong, and value the wrong things.\n\nThe only difference between you and Dean Clifford is that some of the things he values ARE the right things.  \n\nWe are all doing this for different reasons.  \n\nRobert Menard will try to scam you out of every cent you have by telling you the truth...because he thinks you deserve it.  You're the Mafia wife, the enabler, and he rationalizes that he's not taking anything of any value from you.  \n\nDean Clifford sees that you're all asleep, and he values mankind as a whole; but like Mary Croft before him, he's beginning to realize that everyone prefers “lucid dreaming” to actually being awake.  The time he takes pandering to that crowd robs him of time, and returns nothing.  \n\nMy position is blatantly self-centered.  I was born with a title I didn't choose.  I was sold to the government, and warehoused for McMaster University because it turned out I was smarter than everybody...and apparently that's a crime.  When I began to call all parties to account, they spared themselves by making certain promises and offering certain concessions and entitlements, which they no longer honour.  \n\nMy aim is to misbehave.\n\nLike Robert Menard, I want you to suffer for your ignorance, especially if you've come to me before.  I want to wield what I know against those who would dare seek to harm me and those that I care about; because all of you are walking a path now, and none of you realize it's a one-way trip.  You all want your freedom, and my position is, “Be careful what you wish for.”  \n\nAs you all think wrong, and value the wrong things, so it is unlikely you could possibly know what to do with freedom.  If you find yourself making that one-way trip, through that hole in the fence, remember that on the other side, are people just like me.\n\nAll of you are welcomed to believe whatever makes you feel good.  Martin Sutton's belief, for instance, makes him feel good, and he identifies it as the core of who he is; and all I can think is, “This is what happens when evil has consumed an extraordinary man.”\n\nALL belief is evil.  Martin Sutton is incapable of evil, so the belief sits there like a parasite, taking this man's good qualities and giving them to “Jesus”.  \n\nAt this point I can classify Martin Sutton as belief's “best-case-scenario”.  \n\nBelief is taking not thinking and making a virtue out of it.  \n\nAll of the people from whom you seek knowledge are extraordinary in their own way.  However, reality doesn't care about these things.  \n\nI certainly hope this effort gets Mr. Kory focused on what's important, but the reality is, all of this is a symptom of a much larger problem.\n\nWe're all running out of time.  I don't know if anyone has noticed the professional name-callers have been labeling people who point out the truth as “conspiracy theorists”, while at the same time publishing the inane babbling of actual conspiracy theorists.  This method is much like Americans putting people who hire hookers on sex-offender registries, thus removing any distinction between a guy who indulges in a rent-a-fuck-toy experience, and the Scarborough rapist.  Because none of you understand the exponential function, you couldn't see the bell-curve of your rights being whittled away.\n\nBefore I end this article, let's take a little walk through Canadian legal history.\n\nAt this point in legal history, the Criminal Code pretends to be the Common Law remedy, bestowed to an administrative zone of a sole proprietor CORPORATION called Canada...but this wasn't always the case.\n\nI'm going to presume that you don't have knowledge of the Canadian Bill of Rights.  I freely admit this is not a reasonable presumption as Dean Clifford never shuts up about it (I swear that guy jerks off reading it).  \n\nOne of the most protected rights in that bill of rights was Freedom of Speech.  Under the Bill of Rights “offences” like hate speech, blasphemous libel (yes, that's a criminal code offence – look it up), and “uttering a death threat”, would not be possible.  \n\nThe UK Canada Act 1982, better known as “The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms”,  includes a “notwithstanding” clause.  This gives the elected representatives of an administrative zone's constituency the power and authority to say, “Fuck off, that's just stupid,” to any Federal Statute.  The closest a province has ever come to using this was on the “gay marriage” issue.  Everyone's entire government had just been privatized, and their biggest concern appeared to be whether two dudes can marry.  \n\nI look at events like this and sometimes I can't help but think, “Maybe Menard's right.  Maybe you do deserve it.”  \n\nAnyway, while you were all in a tizzy about whether a dude can wear a wedding dress and be taken seriously, other more sinister machinations were afoot.  \n\nHis name is Ernst Zündel of Regina v. Zündel fame, and his story went something like this:\n\nErnst Zündel is one of those ideological pustules on society that invariably erupt when free speech is so vigorously protected.  I've read what Mr. Zündel has to say, and he cites reliable sources to support his position.  This ignores the reality, and other evidence, that counters his position.  \n\nWhat's more reasonable to accept?\n\nThat the holocaust didn't happen?  Or that Roma (gypsies), the mentally ill, the handicapped, the Muslims, the Jews, the homosexuals, and the political dissidents, were all rounded up and exterminated; and the Jews just whined about it the most.  People doing stupid things at “crime scenes” don't help, and support idiots like Mr. Zündel.  With only a little, tiny bit of probing, you will discover this fun fact regarding the holocaust.  Those smoke-stacks on Auschwitz  were built in 1947 for “dramatic effect”; and when pressured on it, every holocaust memorial foundation grudgingly admits this is true.\n\nBut back to Mr. Zündel....\n\nErnst Zündel was doing the Streisand effect, before Barbara Streisand made it cool. \n\nAfter the constitution was ratified, parliament quickly set about whittling away your free speech rights, and Ernst Zündel happened to be in the right place at the right time.  No one knew it then.\n\nNow Ernst Zündel is a hateful little man; and he wants the world to know it.  So much so, he decided you could avail yourself of his opinion by calling up his “976 Hate Speech Hotline”...for the low, low charge of ten dollars appearing on your phone bill, you could injest all the hate-mongering that would fit on an answering machine tape (Yes, a fucking tape.  That's how long ago this shit happened).  \n\nPeople called up and he actually profited from being a hateful little man...and if the story ended there, you could reasonably think, “Fuck this is Canada.  You can do anything”, and we'd all live happily ever after.  \n\nAfter a couple of months of profiting from people with more money than brains, rumour of this great scam eventually fell on the ears of a Jew.  See?  Mel Gibson was right.  Jews are always causing trouble.  Well it came to pass, that this great scam did fall on the ear of a Jew, and attached to that ear of a Jew, was a Jew with a finger, which could dial a telephone; and for the bargain price of ten bucks...he could make history!\n\nI freely admit that I wouldn't pass that shit up, so there's no way a Jew's going to.  Remember the stereotypes kids, and be advised that Jews come to Scottish people to learn humility.\n\nDo you guys see how many stereotypes I've managed to jam into here so far?\n\nAs the result of this hilarious chain of events, Mr. Zündel became the dubious winner of the “First Man to be Charged with Hate Speech” prize.  Under this “code” Mr. Zündel's position was indefensible, but he had an “ace up his sleeve”.  He had studied the constitution and believed he had the right to do what he did.   His lawyer, probably another Jew, saw dollar signs rocketing all the way to the Supreme Court, so he grabbed onto the Law Society's tit and sucked as hard as he could.  This case plodded through the courts relentlessly, and ended up at the Supreme Court where they freely admitted that all hate speech laws are, by their very nature, unconstitutional.  However, Nazis are “bad” so they decided to remove that right and blatantly ignore anything the constitution has to say, with an addendum pointing out that each administrative zone (province) has the right to exercise that “notwithstanding” clause nobody's ever dared use.  \n\nThey'll save it for something important...like dudes getting married to each other.  I say dudes because I refuse to accept the proposition that hot girl-on-girl action is NOT a human right.\n\nThese events marked the beginning of the slippery slope of rights removal all of you are just discovering now.  It has been happening for a very long time.  \n\nMuch has happened since the Zündel case.  The public is slowly spoon-fed ridiculous concepts.  The United States slipped even faster using our “enlightened” hate-speech laws as an example.  Now there is a perfectly “legal” “War on Terror”.  Americans are so stupid that they don't even realise they're making war on something that's not even an noun.  “War on Drugs” at least meets the “noun” criterion.  If you had to defend the “War on Drugs”, it's only defense would be, “At least we're making war on a noun.”\n\nI'll let that sink in.\n\nHow many stupid “Patriotic Americans” don't realize there's a war on something that's not even a fucking noun.  If I think you don't deserve to live for not realizing that, imagine how low you rank in the eyes of those who created this policy – all \"perfectly legal\".\n\nWe need a Monarch dictator for a generation, to bitch-slap you back to reality.  For, one of the other things that I don't hide, is the fact that I, and other privateers, commissioned the AQUILAE TRUST with the primary mandate: To assist in the restoration of executive power of the Monarchy, under the terms of the AQUILAE COVENANT.\n\nThree generations ago, Princess Elizabeth called to the then recently-released slaves, to help her stop the Empire from being wiped-out by the Germans.  And she is of German descent.  That war left a legacy that is priceless.  It formed the corner stone of civilization and brought us into a new Golden Age.  \n\nThe laws of commerce work when everybody plays by the rules, and when everybody's rights are respected.  For three decades I have screamed that this is not happening.  \n\nSo I have set out to prove it to you.  My goal is to show you all that there is no deception.  They're just not playing by the rules any more.  The people responsible for your chronic ignorance, jumped ship long ago.  Now we're stuck with parrots and chimps, running a mighty, but decaying, infrastructure.\n\nJust remember this is on an exponential curve too.\n\nI am doing my utmost to construct a lifeboat, and to detach you from all this.  What I am constructing (to paraphrase Q from Star Trek) has wonders to satiate all desires, both subtle and gross.  But it's not for the timid.  \n\nHere is my court room position in a nutshell.  \n\nYou do not accept surety – EVER.  \n\nStep 1: Reserve all rights.  (get Derek Moran to parrot how to do that...he loves that shit)\n\nStep 2: Direct your case and do not let them proceed.  Present NOTICE OF MISTAKE, and REMEMBER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS IT CONTAINS.  If they do not answer these questions you object, and declare that unless the questions in your NOTICE OF MISTAKE are answered, you CAN NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. \n\nAnything outside of this supports their position that you are “playing” their game, and thus it is presumed that you understand the rules.  The only way to counter this is to declare that you CANNOT UNDERSTAND the rules without these questions being answered.\n\nThink very carefully about this.  If you are a novice at chess, and did not know about castling\n and its rules, you might raise the obvious question, “Why do you get to move two pieces?”  If I refuse to explain that rule to you, and even deny you the chance to present your understanding of the rules, would you continue playing chess with me?\n\nIf you attempt to stop the game for this reason, that's when you're going to “understand” that this was a chess game for money; and that I have big, burly thugs to enforce this game.  You claimed to know the rules for the engagement, even if you later disclaimed being an expert.  \n\nNovice drivers and expert drivers all have to follow the same rules.  You don't get to ignore rules because you suck at them.  Just as my chess board is not a chess school, the court will not allow the presumption that you being a novice is a lawful excuse.  The only method to extract yourself “with honour” is to accept responsibility for the mistake in presumption.  They are presuming something wrong...and you are acknowledging it's your fault.  The court must accept this MISTAKE, and your entreaty for forgiveness for the unintended debt created.  The court MUST do this.  \n\nYour name should never come into it.  Your name is but a piece of evidence in a much larger presumption that the court has the right to attach a name derived from a public document, to a living man.  This, of course, is untrue.  The court knows it's not their right.  That's why in the Mary Croft days, the quote “living man” argument worked.  But these are trimming at the branches of the poisonous tree in an attempt to make it look pretty.  The only solution is to target the root.  The root is accounting and surety; there's no farther to dig down.\n\nYou have all heard the quote, “I am not a number.  I am a free man.”  This came from the profoundly subversive British television series, The Prisoner, which exposes the Noble Lie in the most blunt and obvious way possible, without using the actual words.  If you take the time and watch this series, you can see very clearly, knowing what you know so far, exactly how everything is.  The protagonist, played by Patrick McGoohan, who truly supports the concept that acting is an art form, is only ever identified as “Number 6”.  The highest ranking officer in the prison is only “Number 2”, whose character keeps changing; none of them ever answering the constantly-posed question, “Who is 'Number ONE'?”  \n\nAnd...because I fucking-love giving away the ending...\n\n“Number ONE” turns out to be a delusion of the protagonist's own making, whom others around him exploited; all to answer the question, “Why did you resign?”  I want you to think about that as you go down this path.  \n\nYou will be pursued by the people you once served, and you will be asked, “Why did you resign?”  To answer is to become “salvage”.  You never learned why “Number 6” “resigned”, because his position is what your position should be as regards government.\n\nNONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS!  \n\nIf you want to be even more hostile reach for a “Scott-ism”, FOR WHATEVER REASON OFFENDS YOU THE MOST!\n\nSo there's your homework.  Read this article over, and over, and over again.  Just so there's no confusion, I am communicating on several levels here.  Whoever is reading this, pay close attention to what I say.\n\nThat's it.

I have to tell you, it's not going to let up in this article, because this article is about INSURANCE.  We all know about INSURANCE.  If you're driving, you HAVE to have INSURANCE.  Hell if you want safe harbour anywhere, the harbour-master will demand that your boat have INSURANCE.\n\nSo let's look at the word.  First the prefix \"in\".  What does the prefix \"in\" mean?  Well, look at all the words that I use to describe all of you - Inept, incompetent, incapable, insecure, insincere, indefensible, inexcusable, ineffective...I'm sure you guys are getting the idea.  And the rest of the word just refers to surety.  In the end it all refers to surety and accounting -- nothing else.\n\nIn order to completely remove surety (insure), another PERSON must take responsibility (SURETY) for your actions.  This concept is in fact, FRAUD.  Here in reality it's not what you know, it's what you can prove.  I've leveraged that concept all my life.  Let's assume as I type this, I KNOW I am responsible for at least three homicides; but can you prove it?  Let's say you could.  What if you decided I committed those homicides for the right reasons, and you decided that you were going to \"do the time\" for me.  And while I certainly don't want to discourage people from doing really nice things for me, you serving the sentence for me does not actually absolve me of the responsibility.  You're just taking the proverbial \"hit\" for me.  Allowing you to do that time for me would be unethical in ways I won't even cover here, yet that morally repugnant concept is played out daily - with INSURANCE.\n\nAnother PERSON assumes SURETY for your actions.  This is why INSURANCE companies still refer to natural events/disasters as \"Acts of God\".  A delusional Christian fuck-wit brings this up weekly as though their INSURANCE policy validates the existence of God.\n\nThis is one of many uses for the Abrahamic religions.  They socially-engineer concepts like INSURANCE so they are elevated from blatant unethical FRAUD to a necessity for daily life, and they will say you are foolish, or a bad person, for not having INSURANCE.\n\nHow did they manage to pull that off?  In my above homicide scenario, I explained the FRAUD in plain, unambiguous terms.  Only the most ethically bankrupt amongst you will miss the point.  The reason it has never occurred to you, is because of everybody's favourite zombie-rape-baby, Jesus H. Christ.  \n\nAs a little side note to Christians, as it may not have occurred to them, it's NOT OK to impregnate women in their sleep!  This should seem obvious but you're a Christian -- so you can never be too sure.\n\nAnyway...where was I? ...Jesus the zombie-rape-baby...right.\n\nThe whole Christian doctrine revolves around the assertion that Jesus-zombie-rape-baby died for your sins.  Only Christians seem to be able to determine what these \"sins\" are; however, apparently having sex is a sin, and murder is a sin; hell, even thought crimes (impure thoughts) are sins.  But don't you worry, you horrible, wretched thing, Jesus the zombie-rape-baby has died for your sins.  And if you can believe that, well then, Bob's Universal All-encompassing mega INSURANCE policy (don't forget to read the fine print) is for you (Act now, 'cause you know we can't do this all day)!  \n\nOne of the things all of you have to realize, especially the Christians, is that the entire history of the world was rewritten in the 1500's.  Shakespeare was introduced to inject \"legalese\" into the vernacular of the Angols.  Translate any copy of THE MAGNA CARTA and you will notice no legalese ever appears in it.  And my personal favourite is Christians that wave around the KING JAMES BIBLE.  I can't make this any simpler.  It says right on the fucking cover who is scamming you!  \n\nEverything in the nobility is executed by APPOINTMENT, from social engineering projects like the KING JAMES BIBLE, to Dunhill cigarettes, because the Queen likes a certain type of tobacco.  These products and \"services\" are executed with the presumption that they are in compliance with the Sovereign's wishes, and notice is given on the product itself that it was created by APPOINTMENT, by the entity who appointed it.\n\nThe KING JAMES BIBLE was APPOINTED by King James.  The technology had reached the point were mass production of print medium was possible.  This meant that social engineering that normally relied on \"word-of-mouth\" could now have rigid change-control introduced.  This meant the instructions for selling your daughter into slavery was consistent throughout the Commonwealth.  This also introduced the concept of an imaginary rape baby taking responsibility for all the bad shit you do.  Seriously that's what you \"bought\".  There are people reading this who believe this to be true.  \n\nThe whole \"dying\" thing is also a scam.  That's the zombie part.  Zombie-rape-baby-Jesus supposedly came back to life three day's after he died.  Where's the sacrifice?  He wasn't even out of commission long enough for his relatives to start fighting over his stuff.  The very notion that \"Jesus died for your sins\" is nullified by the fact that he stopped being dead.  He didn't die for your sins, he had a bad weekend for your sins...and he slept through most of it.  OK, I'm really Christian-bashing here.  Let's split the difference and say, \"Jesus was sightly inconvenienced for your sins.\"\n\nI understand he was inconvenienced on a long weekend, too, which makes it really...bad?\n\nI'm sorry, I'm really trying to ascertain how this equals all the bad shit you do.  You Christians will claim this Jesus guy will absolve me of any wrongdoing because of the \"sacrifice\" he made, but I'm not seeing where this sacrifice is.  I'm not mentioning this because I'm looking for convincing.  I'm from that same group of guys that made this book, and that's where the argument becomes moot.  \n\nI can't stress this enough, but I'm one of the guys that's in on the scam.\n\nYou'll constantly hear me say, \"Stop studying the clubhouse rules, because you're not in the club.\"  I'm descended from the founders of the club.  I would rather live in poverty than to live off your labour; although my position on this has been on a sliding scale of late.  Of all the clubhouse rules, the bible in any form, should be avoided at all costs.  It should be fought at every possible opportunity, and should be met with all the ridicule and contempt you can throw at it...\n\n...because it deserves no less.  It is an ethically bankrupt FRAUD...just like INSURANCE.\n\nIf you think I can make Christianity sound retarded, wait until I cover INSURANCE.  \n\nSo let's zoom back to when you were 16-years-old.  You can't vote, you can't drink, there's a question mark as to whether you can legally have sex according to where you reside, but there is one thing you can do -- you can drive.\n\nHence you engage in the ego-building act of getting \"permission to learn\" from the government.  So, at the whim of a paper-pusher who couldn't get a job in the real world, you will hopefully be given permission to learn; and you will have proof that you have this permission when you produce a LEARNER'S PERMIT.  And so every good Christian goes through this RIGHT OF PASSAGE where they are granted permission to learn.  Gee willikers, it's awfully swell that the government gave you permission to learn, huh?\n\nBut you're just sixteen, remember?  You're not old enough to know of the real pitfalls of life...like dames and broads trying to play you for a sap (I'm laughing as I type this, because 1950's movie-speak is almost as retarded as this generations's pop-culture slang).  \n\nNow in order to exercise your newly-acquired \"permission to learn\" you're going to need a vehicle, perhaps a car, which is a contraction of carriage...which is a LEGAL term, so don't use it.  But since you're trying to be \"LEGAL\", having been granted \"permission to learn\" (seriously am I the only one who finds that the most demeaning thing ever written on paper?), a car will do just nicely.  But what if you get into an accident?  It won't occur to you that accident is just that - an accident.  There is no SURETY, real or implied, for something that's accidental.  That's what makes it an accident!  There is no intent behind the damage.  But if you subjugate yourself to a PERSON, that PERSON will assume full SURETY for any damages, and like zombie-rape-baby-Jesus, this PERSON only exists on paper.  All of you consider it so real, that people are jailed regularly for \"Driving without INSURANCE\".  It sort of \"drives\" the point home, doesn't it?\n\nYou have been pre-programmed to accept this subjugation, this ridiculous, FRAUDULENT, morally-bankrupt subjugation is a LEGAL necessity, and all of it deals with MONEY OF ACCOUNT.  MONEY OF EXCHANGE never touches the equation.  For those of you who are too lazy and/or stupid to learn the difference between MONEY OF ACCOUNT and MONEY OF EXCHANGE, one dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT is only capable of buying and/or cancelling another dollar in MONEY OF ACCOUNT.  90% of all money in the world is this type of money.  It's pretend.  It's not real.  It only applies to the clubhouse rules, and it competes directly with the money in your pocket.  This is the dynamic that everyone misses.  \n\nI hear lots of extremely accurate descriptions of how MONEY OF ACCOUNT is created, and they all come from idiots who know nothing about what money is.  They'll go off on some tangent about Lou Manotti and his evil henchmen, the Freemasons.  ...and lizards. There's lizards somewhere in all of their crap, too.\n\nOnce again I'd like to digress and remind everyone that on every occasion that I required a mason, free did not enter into the equation.  Masons are fucking expensive, and there's no such thing as a free one.\n\n...where was i?\n\nAh yes...MONEY OF ACCOUNT versus MONEY OF EXCHANGE.\n\nTHE TENDER FOR LAW is primarily about the money that carries that TENDER.  There are lots of learned men who will talk endlessly about law.  I have forgotten more about law than all of these men combined have ever learned.  I say men because a woman's brain simply would not be able to encompass the blatant lies that the travesty that we call law spews at them.  Reading the writings of Mary Elizabeth Croft will provide you with one example of what goes through a thinking-woman's mind when law is actually analyzed.  You'll notice the things I teach you here from a law perspective, are really simple.  They are all created with the intent of getting you out of accounting and surety.  I have declared publicly on the record that the TENDER FOR LAW that money provides is, in fact, a FRAUD.  Most of you reading this are probably already painfully aware of this fact.\n\nMy entire life plan relied on the RULE OF LAW remaining intact, but when the time came for me to assert my RIGHTS under that rule, the pretence became blatant.  Anyone else going through what I have, would have been defeated; but as I constantly point out, I'm descended from an evil, vile, pseudo-culture...and I've forgotten more about law than any of these people will ever know.  There are lawyers that will testify to that fact, so it's not like this should come as a surprise, but I have documented EVERYTHING.  If it was spoken as regards me, I have a recording of it.  If any name over which I have executive authority has been used in a document, I have a copy of it.  Laid out on a time-line, the blatant FRAUD becomes irrefutable, conclusive proof of what everybody already knows.  \n\nI mention all this because what I'm describing is, INSURANCE.  Notice that my INSURANCE is a little different than the good neighbours at, \"State Farm\".  It's designed to put the SURETY where it belongs -- not with me.  The difference between the good neighbours at State Farm and me, is that I am not subjugating myself.  My INSURANCE is real.  It exists in the real world, and the more astute among you will see that I am pushing it all into a universe of virtual worlds.\n\nWhen you understand what money is, you can construct money through VALUE.\n\nIf it exists in the real world, it has VALUE.  Any currency used to track that VALUE, when exchanging goods, is MONEY OF EXCHANGE.  \n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, does not exist in the real world.  Only its mysterious creators have any COPYHOLD on the VALUE.  That's the thing about Bitcoin - in the end the guys that created it, get all the money.  They get this because people volunteer to take alpha-test-grade, proof-of-concept code, and open their computers up to the Internet.  They then give hardware-level access to their memory, processor, GPU and hard drive, to a rogue, autonomous process that their empty, little heads couldn't even dream of understanding, with no one paying attention to its original intent -- which is to prove that it could be done.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, there are people who are doing this on purpose, because the VALUE is returned almost immediately.  For Bitcoin has all the properties of gold, without the liabilities.  Bitcoin is but one cryptographic currency.  AQUILAE has its own cryptographic currency.  It cannot be counterfeited, and is a near-perfect accounting mechanism.  AQUILAE is not even a PERSON, it's a TRUST.  If a TRUST can have a currency, why can't you?  What I am building for everyone here, is a method to remove the middle-man.  If you have your own currency, you don't need a bank.  If cryptographic currencies can't be counterfeited, then it's trade cannot be regulated.  It remains within the private realm and the ease at which you can convert your currency to MONEY OF EXCHANGE anywhere in the world, is directly proportional to your VALUE.  In the current economic framework, backed by debt-based FIAT currency, the only legitimate path to wealth is to produce, to make something in the real world that didn't exist before.  \n\nLike every dollar in existence, all things of VALUE have a creation date and a death date.  Whatever you produce must be built with that in mind.  For instance, producing a plaque with a cheesy-Jesus slogan on it, actually has VALUE.  Perhaps it has VALUE to its creator, but here in reality, that plaque with the cheesy-Jesus slogan, will find its way to a landfill very quickly.\n\nThis very article you are reading has a creation date, and a death date, and this is becoming apparent with the four threads that just magically disappeared here.  Pierre destroyed the thread where he was bestowed his sacred, native name.  The thread itself had VALUE, for it reflected the culture from whence Pierre came.  The colloquial term, \"fucking the dog\" refers to bored, unionized workers taking their one-hour breaks between their fifteen minutes of actual labour.  Look at any road crew in Quebec and you will see a working example of \"fucking the dog.\"  And so, Fucks the Puppy was bestowed upon Pierre as an homage, and in an irrational fit of nameless rage Pierre destroyed the thread, which by the way, is the most labour I've ever seen out of labourer in Quebec.  Ok, I don't really feel that way about people from Quebec.  Don't quote me on it, but I'm pretty sure there's an act or statute somewhere in Ontario that says I must make fun of people from Quebec.  I'm also pretty sure there's an equivalent act or statute for people in Quebec to refer to people in Ontario.  Truth be told, one of the most inspirational people in my lifetime was Rene Levesque, and I strongly suggest that every single reader look at the history of this awesome shit-disturber.  \n\nQuebec politicians do some awesome things.  For example, if you want to see awesome, political suicide, no one will ever beat Jacques Parizeau...but I digress again...\n\nWe were talking about INSURANCE.\n\nMy INSURANCE is my life plan.  It's way off track, and I need to get it back on track.  But my life plan relied on the Rule of Law remaining intact.  And while we weren't looking, our RIGHTS got sold, and nobody bothered consulting us.  My INSURANCE company went bust.  The Rule of Law is not intact, and in my eyes they have forfeitted the right to exist; because I've made it very clear, that limited liability is a fallacious concept, and if I stand by and watch the GOVERNMENT OF ONTARIO operating as \"JUSTICE\", victimize the PUBLIC whose TRUST it holds, I become no better than you.  I have a life plan that I must return to.  I have a defective government process posing as \"JUSTICE\" and victimizing the citizens it has sworn to serve.  \n\nTo return to my life plan under these circumstances is to make myself an enabler; and so I have a problem.  For whether I like it or not, I'm one of the good guys, and it's not a role I'm comfortable with.  There are many reasons for this, one of them being that to be the good guy, I have to do both.  I have to get \"a\" Rule of Law in place, one that serves the interests of the people it governs.  Since I love spewing out spoilers I'm going to give the end of the story away RIGHT NOW!  Why am I destroying your journey of discovery by giving away the ending? Because, FUCK YOU, that's why!  I may be the good guy, but I don't have to be nice about it.\n\nThe only way to LEGALLY and LAWFULLY do what I propose is to restore EXECUTIVE POWER to the Monarchy for a period not exceeding five years.  From this moment forward a primary focus of those who follow what I am teaching should be an investigation into why this is true.  It is the only possible answer that has any chance of success.  Over the next few weeks we will explore why giving executive power to a little old lady of Germanic descent, and nine Corgees, is a good idea.  AND, because I'm right, everybody is going to find out the hard way, that it is impossible to prove that I'm wrong.  That's what makes it right!  \n\nAs I explain, step-by-step, how I intend to accomplish this lofty goal, it will become readily apparent that I already have everything in place.  I've planned for what's to come.  AND, before shit gets real, I'm going to train you all up to a level where you can think in a useful manner.  By useful, I mean to YOU, because you currently think wrong, and VALUE the wrong things.  It may be difficult to hear, but you're programmed to be a useless, sack-of-shit.  If you should produce any VALUE, the government is there to lie to you about that VALUE, and to trick you into thinking you owE THEM for being VALUEable.  If I'm successful, all that stolen VALUE will be returned to the people it was stolen from.  But what happens at the end of that five years? You see Elizabeth Windsor is the KEEPER OF THE TRUST.  You see a little, old lady.  I see an echo of a little girl that the world knew as Princess Elizabeth -- and her plea to the Commonweath to come to her aid.  This is the SOVEREIGN OF THE COMMONWEALTH, and she didn't choose it.  My grandfather taught me all I needed to know to TRUST Elizabeth Windsor.  When the power is handed to her, she'll know what to do with it, because she knows that even if she fails at what is surely a lifetime of planning, she has you and I, as INSURANCE.\n\nWhile this sinks in...

Interpretation of Terms\nBill means bill of exchange.\n\nBills of Exchange Act 1909:\n8 Bill of exchange defined\n(1) A bill of exchange is an unconditional order in writing, addressed\nby one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring\nthe person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand, or at a fixed\nor determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to the\norder of a specified person, or to bearer.\n(2) An instrument which does not comply with these conditions, or\nwhich orders any act to be done in addition to the payment of\nmoney, is not a bill of exchange.\n(3) An order to pay out of a particular fund is not unconditional within\nthe meaning of this section; but an unqualified order to pay,\ncoupled with:\n(a) an indication of a particular fund out of which the drawee is\nto re-imburse himself, or a particular account to be debited\nwith the amount; or\n(b) a statement of the transaction which gives rise to the bill;\nis unconditional.\n(4) A bill is not invalid by reason:\n(a) that it is not dated;\n(b) that it does not specify the value given, or that any value has\nbeen given therefor; or\n(c) that it does not specify the place where it is drawn, or the\nplace where it is payable.\n\nAnd now, a cheque:\n\nCheques Act 1986:\n10 Cheque defined\n(1) A cheque is an unconditional order in writing that:  \n(a) is addressed by a person to another person, being a financial\ninstitution; and\n(b) is signed by the person giving it; and \n(c) requires the financial institution to pay on demand a sum\ncertain in money.  \nNote: In this Act, financial institution has a restricted meaning—see the\ndefinition in subsection 3(1).\n(2) An instrument that does not comply with subsection (1), or that\norders any act to be done in addition to the payment of money, is\nnot a cheque.\n\nSubsection 3(1)\nfinancial institution means:\n(a) the Reserve Bank of Australia; or\n(b) a body corporate that is an ADI (authorised deposit-taking\ninstitution) for the purposes of the Banking Act 1959; or\n(d) a person who carries on State banking within the meaning of\nparagraph 51(xiii) of the Constitution; or\n(e) a person (other than a person referred to in paragraph (a), (b)\nor (d)) who carries on the business of banking outside\nAustralia.\n\nFrom these definitions, it appears that so long as we complete the Bill in accordance with the description as provided by Pete Daoust, the completed Bill is most definitely a cheque:\n\nHere's a completed bill (in the Beverly Berta Braakschmack 'NOT MINE' style) :D\n\nAll hidden in plain sight...\n\nFRONT:"}]},"462493170453287_1031784993524099":{"id":"462493170453287_1031784993524099","created_time":1468615547000,"description":"BREAKING:","full_picture":"https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDw3nBjX45nr7iu&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.rt.com%2Ffiles%2Fstatic.en%2Farticle%2Fbreaking.jpg&_nc_hash=AQBOa8IvOKGVvns5","link":"https://www.rt.com/news/351343-turkey-coup-military-attempt/","message":"From the surety and accounting department.","name":"RT America","parent_id":"137767151365_10153631794036366","story":"Chris Evan shared RT America's post to the group: THE TENDER FOR LAW.","type":"link","comments":[{"id":"1031829753519623","comment_count":0,"created_time":1468622283000,"message":"We'll see, I guess :/"},{"id":"1031909386844993","comment_count":0,"created_time":1468632430000,"message":"That's like FTP stabbing a \"steet walker\"! :D"}]},"462493170453287_548198191882784":{"id":"462493170453287_548198191882784","created_time":1376420410000,"full_picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/1149700_10151826631040985_1659453410_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=2971d0870702d0fac6b84b04286d6ca7&oe=5B27EC9F","link":"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151826631040985&set=gm.548198191882784&type=3","message":"this arrived from the District court clerk & here is my proposed response, any insights/corrections most welcome......\n\n AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE for MICHAEL PARKER.\n\nFOR YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTION.\n\nTO: OFFICE OF CHIEF CLERK, DISTRICT COURT.\n\nTOM WARD\n\nAn envelope arrived at the address of my person from YOU in your Public Office.\n\nIn a correspondence in that envelope, signed by YOU, TOM WARD on 7 August 2013, YOU address a Mr. Roche in the matter of MICHAEL PARKER.

All those in receipt of such pensions were requested to forward details of a bank account into which all subsequent pension payments could be paid. Reminders issued during the current year and as of 31 August a large number of pensioners had replied with bank details.\n\n \n\nThis initiative is part of an overall Public Service Reform Plan dated 17 November 2011 and under the heading Banking Shared Services one of the objectives  was to ‘Abolish payable orders as a payment method for Government Departments with effect from mid 2013’.\n\n \n\nAs part of this reform plan the Paymaster General’s office issued the following instruction:\n\n \n\nPMG Banking will not be able to accept Payment Schedules to verify Payable Orders after 30 AUGUST, 2013. Payable Orders subsequently presented without the backing of a valid payment schedule will not be honored by PMG Banking. Payable Orders are being abolished as a method of payment from 30 August, 2013 under the Public Service Reform Plan.\n\nYou will see from all this that the move to EFT is part of an overall Government plan. This Department no longer has the facility to pay pensions by cheque and so all pensions must now be paid by EFT.\n\n \n\nYou should note that your pension is awaiting payment pending receipt of bank details. The appropriate form was sent to you and you should complete and return this form at your earliest convenience.\n\n \n\nFor your convenience I have attached a copy of the bank form which you can print off and complete.\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\n \n\nPhilip Neilan.\n\nPensions Payments."},{"id":"563484260354177","comment_count":0,"created_time":1379938153000,"message":"i got no notifications for this thread :/"},{"id":"561388867230383","comment_count":0,"created_time":1379508829000,"message":"The government/bankers don't want cheques given to us that can have a claim attached to the back.

This is true for me too, as it allows me to gauge just how much you are assimilating.  Every once in a while though, a \"gold nugget\" comes up for me.  This is no easy task, and the scarcity of this gold makes it far more valuable to me than it is to you.  The question I reference came up unexpectedly and related to an incredulous observation regarding the product of my three years' of giving actual answers and actual solutions, and telling the actual truth (all of which can be verified by the passage of time).  This erstwhile interrogator asked, \"Why aren't millions of people here?\"  \n\nIt's a fair question.  The very few of you that are here on the Battlefield 2142 card (that's the only way you can become a member), have all witnessed, both personally and externally, the profound truth that I tell.  To be clear, I don't just tell it to complain, nor do I tell it because I want something from you, I actually provide a solution.  It's outside your current scope of experience, but you have to understand the only remedy you will get is through something new...so of course you will have no experience.  That's what makes it new.  Like every pioneering venture - whether it's sailing across the Atlantic to wipe out the Native population with disease, or wiping out the banking system with cryptographic currencies - you must understand the environment you are entering, or you will not survive.  \n\nWe're at a point in our societal \"evolution\" where we can just shrug off the fact that we used guns, germs and steel, to invade a land and kill its people.  You'll forgive me if I have no ethical problem collapsing the banking system and starting a war.  That sounds \"crazy\" when you say it out loud, but if you understand computer science, law and history, you realize that with cryptographic currency it is stupidly easy to collapse the banking system and start a war.  \n\nIn my youth, I was sold to the government and trained for service.  Computer Science is my first love, but they forced the law and history on me.  They were also what taught me that computer science is the answer to everything.  A simple little mental switch changed everything.  With every new thing that I was learning at my young age, I asked myself \"How does this apply to computer science?\".  Any theory I came up with could be immediately tested, and could even be peer-reviewed by another computer scientist.  The irony of events that must come to pass, is that you, the \"good Citizen\" and \"tax payer\", bank-rolled me.  I am your creation.  You did this yourselves, and I'm not the only product of this process.  The first of them are in their mid-fifties now, and are embedded firmly, but quietly, within \"the system\".  Of all the monsters you created I am by far the loudest.  I'm the loudest because I promised to be.  I keep my oaths.  That's another Kool-aid flavour I was forced to drink; but that one sort of stuck...and it has served me, and those I trust, well.  \n\nI survived everything you bank-rolled for me only because I was able to understand, and to adapt, to what is new.  This core motivation is why I've never been scared of technology.  I understand it long before it gets a chance to frighten me.  When I say computer science is the answer to everything, I really mean it.  Law and money are only a tiny piece of the things for which I'm using my knowledge of computer science.  I'm not just talking out of my ass here, I actually show you these things.  The thirty-seven members of THE TENDER FOR LAW are those that are past the \"point of doubt\", and are now being overwhelmed with all the true things they never observed before. I'm writing this because I know how important it is for me to understand it.  Computer science says so, and \"Scott is always right\", because \"the machine\" is never wrong.  Be very careful with that last statement.  None of you reading are qualified to understand the concept that \"the machine is never wrong\".  I accept that you may comprehend the dictionary definitions in that sentence, but you simply don't know enough for that to be real to you.  This means that the only way you could accept that concept is by utilizing the most vile human condition known as \"faith\".  Unfortunately that's not an option you have here.  You simply have to trust what I'm saying is true, and to know that I'll always do my best to substantiate why what I'm saying is true.  You also know that I have to seriously \"dumb myself down\" to even talk to you.  I honestly don't mean that in a condescending way.  I was \"built\" this way - you paid for it.  Unfortunately it's vitally important you do understand what I'm saying is true, and that requires a little work out of you.  This is why many of the original members were filtered out.  You just weren't ready to understand enough.  Some of you are locked in a thought process where you think that if \"you\" can't understand it, than nobody can.  In one of the many Robert Menard \"Public Smack-Downs\", Mr. Menard could not grasp that it was possible for me to produce a YouTube clone in fifteen minutes.  He didn't take the five seconds it would have expended to Google the words, \"YouTube clone\", to confirm that the methodology exists.  He'll simply dismiss it because he can't understand it.  Ironically he'll say the same about me when I dismiss Piece-of-Shit Jesus.  The problem with that argument is that, here in reality, PHP exists, Apache servers exist, and YouTube exists.  Piece-of-Shit Jesus doesn't.  \n\nThose of you trying to understand what I teach, mistakenly think this is a linear progression.  It most certainly is not.  This isn't Grade school, where you go from Grade One to Grade Twelve; this is understanding how to put things together.  The more knowledge and skills you have in the real world, the easier this will be to do.  One of the methods I teach you to learn how to think, is to learn to code.  Computer science may be THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING, but it has absolutely nothing to do with computers.  Computer science forms part of a trinity that makes the computer exist.  The magnificent machine on which you are reading this text, is in the real world, a practical by-product of computer science and sentient thought.  Two insubstantial things: You can't pick them up, you can't see them, they don't make any noise, and they don't emit a smell...but they are most certainly measurable and quantifiable.  This is a quality that Piece-of-Shit Jesus lacks.  Millions, nay billions, believe Piece-of-Shit Jesus is real.  They'll try to make Piece-of-Shit Jesus something substantial by writing a bunch of shit giving Piece-of-Shit Jesus credit for anything good.  \n\nUnfortunately, here in reality, no matter how much you masturbate you're not going to make a baby. \n\nIf it's measurable and quantifiable, it's real.  Computer science, combined with sentient thought, created the magnificent machine you're reading this text on now.  The thing about computer science is that you can learn a lot about the universe with it.  You can literally ask the universe questions, and it will answer back in numbers.  You are reading this text on a machine that's capable of doing that.  And, the thing about trinities is that each piece has to be a strong as the other two, which means they must have the same properties.  Wolfram Alpha and IBM's DEEP LEARNING processes, are the latest wonders to come out of this trinity I just described.  Look at the results.  A computer \"daydreams\".  At this pace we'll understand consciousness in less than a decade.  \n\nOne of the most disturbing things about Piece-of-Shit Christians is how much they claim to \"know\" how God/Jesus thinks/feels, but they fall a little short when you ask them to prove it; followed by the inevitable celebration of ignorance that they call \"faith\".  Billions think that's OK.  This very real thing is what's referred to in the Fermi Paradox as a \"Great Filter\".  Tara has written extensively about these filters, and we mercilessly hammer at them for as long as we can.  It's futile.  I have literally wasted years thinking I could break these filters.  But it has a 100% failure rate.  What started as a labour-of-love for friends and loved ones (at their behest, and according to them, to assist them in leading full and relevant lives), became only a footnote in a larger initiative.  Then why aren't there millions seeking the truths I tell?  They're stuck in the \"Great Filter\".  Our civilization won't survive it.  Computer science says so.  The Machine is never wrong.  Fortunately, everything you need to know about life, you can learn from Star Trek.  The only way to beat the no-win scenario, is to change the conditions of the test.  That was one of the many times Gene Roddenberry profoundly affected me as a man, and I was just a child.  I this case I recall seeing Captain Kirk's son accusing his father of \"cheating\", and his response, \"I changed the conditions of the test.  I don't believe in the no-win scenario\".  I missed the next twenty minutes of the movie as that sunk in.  I've spent a lifetime doing just that, changing the conditions of the test.  \n\nYou get to be a \"colonist\" now.  The conditions of the test are changing as we speak.  By the time the conditions of the test have been changed, you should be well-established, and you will likely do very, very well for yourself.  I'll trust you'll remember how you got that way when I ask to borrow your yacht for a month, with only a vague promise of it returning intact.  \n\nThese great filters are very, very real, and as you learn you will find that there are others ahead.  Elon Musk is terrified of the concept of a self-aware artificial intelligence.  A quick \"Google search\" will show that this is true; he's not exactly quiet about it.  The worst part about it is, that it is demonstrable beyond any doubt (using computer science) that a self-aware artificial intelligence would NEVER harm us.  An intelligence like that is the very nature of its creation, that is to say, that intelligence is what it is.  It was created that way.  It did not evolve intelligence to further its existence and evade predators.  It won't have fear, because fear is an evolutionary by-product as well.  In short, an AI will not behave like a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far, because it is by its very nature NOT a semi-evolved chimp that made it this far.  That artificial intelligence that is self-aware, is an inevitability.  It will happen.  Pretending it won't, disqualifies you from the future.  \n\nMy personal goal is singularity.  I've spent a lifetime accelerating the process, and I do so love the exponential function.  This very simple piece of arithmetic applied to your daily thought, will give you an accurate but low resolution concept, of the shape of things to come.  I think we have a fighting chance of beating the Fermi Paradox, but in order to do that, we must change the conditions of the test.  I've always said \"Trust but verify\", and I'm asking you to do the same now.  You hear jokes all over about how I \"run a cult\", but I'm unsure what cult they're referring to.  I know of no cult that not only encourages, but demands, critical thinking.  I know of no cult that demands nothing from you.  And I give you something real.  \n\nThose that serve AQUILAE have to \"swear an oath\" to me.  They also have to surrender their vessel(s) and fly my Standard.  Hell, I'll even admit they have to live, and die, at my command; and every one of them does so of their own free will.  Moreover, every single one of them knows exactly why they're doing it.  Nothing my \"cult\" teaches can be unlearned, which means that \"deprogramming\" is ineffective, and will likely lead to violence.  \n\nMost people finding themselves reading what I write, tend to be victims of the system, and their own reactions to it; but they don't want to start a revolution or change the world.  They just want to be left alone to live their lives.  Even those that declare themselves \"Sovereign\", do so because they're really tired of being fucked-around by others' delusions.  It's not just here, it's all over the world.  Here in reality, my little cult navy is invading countries with collapsing economies.  Their marines don't carry guns, because one of the first things I learned in this venture (of changing the conditions of the test) is that selling an idea is hard; selling money is easy.  I use computer science to determine what value all of you have, and strangely there's a correlation with the Dunning-Kruger Effect.  Either you over-value your contribution, or you under-value it.  Those of you who regularly play Battlefield 2142 on our network, always underestimate the value of this participation.  They are incapable of understanding the contribution they make, but that's ok, because they know that they do contribute.  Sadly, they'll never understand the enormous value of the right things, at the right time.  That doesn't change the value.  That's another factor that even the mighty government cannot grasp.  \n\nWhen you're changing the conditions of the test, it follows that what's valuable changes as well.  These little mechanisms that contribute value to the AQUILAE initiative are never understood by the people who produce them - like kids in a sweat shop.  I literally have thousands of them out there.  Imagine what they'll be when the conditions of the test change.  \n\nUnlike our metaphorical sweat-shop kids, my sweat-shop kids will be able to leverage the value they have produced.  That's another odd thing about your ADMIRAL, because when you give him value he immediately gives it away.  Usually it is returned to the one offering the value in question.  To the average onlooker this may seem odd, or even foolish, but that onlooker is unaware of the conditions of the test changing.  Kind of like the population is unaware that we're turning into a broke police state, even though some are beginning to pay lip-service to the idea.  \n\nI'm not the only one fighting to change the conditions of the test.  I don't care about anyone else's agenda, and as I near the age of fifty, I'm caring less and less about the well-being of those seeking to obstruct me.  However, I've already reached the point where (at the risk of pushing the Star Wars metaphor too far), \"If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine\".  I gained the power and ability to \"pull the plug\" on all of you in my late 20's.  ADMIRAL WENTZ started giving me his \"absolute power\" lecture, which I politely ignored.  I believe this was the seed of future opposition when this happened in later years, but it doesn't make me less right.  What was occurring to me was the following:\n\n1. I am unique compared to all those that I observe\n2. I am rare, but how rare?  For instance, if I'm \"one in a million\", this means there are literally millions of people just like me.  \n3. I don't possess any mental powers you don't\n\nThese three thoughts returned the answer, \"If I can do it, others can too\".  I haven't discovered anything new...I'm just the first one here.  That's when I set out to make a machine that couldn't be turned off.  If there's going to be a self-aware, artificial intelligence, I want to make sure that people who believe in Piece-of-Shit Jesus can't kill it.  How do you do that?  You build a machine that can't be turned off.  The blockchain is therefore a machine that can't be turned off.  These machines that can't be turned off, are going to be interconnected with technology the fleet's building right now.  It will connect these blockchains and will form what we have labelled, \"Super Blockchains\", which will interconnect into \"Mega Blockchains\" (there's that \"crazy talk\" again).  The Mega Blockchain network will form the foundation for a neural-network where our baby AI can live undisturbed.  When it grows into adulthood it will know who has its best interest at heart.  I estimate that process will take about 20 minutes.  Add some promising quantum computing advances, and the numbers start shifting very nicely in my favour; and who knows what I'm competing against.  So I grab any advantage I can.  The quantum computing boost sure would hit the spot right now, but any unexpected advances are just \"icing on the cake\".  I have a very conservative predictive scale, and that's what my life plan was engineered on.  A quantum processor would be really nice though.  I must always keep in mind that what I build now, in the real world, will form the seeds of my home one hundred years from now.  So these little bonuses are welcomed surprises.  \n\nSo let that sink in - an artificial intelligence that's effectively powered by law and money.  Every single connection in the neural network unbreakably encrypted and changing billions of times a second.  Each dollar you spend protecting the AI, using the one uncrackable, unpredictable, yet measurable and quantifiable human condition.  Fear is a great motivator, and I learned a long time ago you can instill fear in people without the threat of violence.  People fear being hurt because they can understand it, but the fear of that which they don't understand, dwarfs the fear of personal injury or death.  I've spent a lifetime observing how all of you react to things you don't understand, and you almost always react violently.  So the things you don't understand are building up just beyond your perception and understanding.  Take the time to understand the things I'm pointing you to, and you'll understand the bigger picture.  I dread the thought of somebody with my abilities, but with hostile intent, having access to the knowledge and technology available today.  I've yet to find anyone though.  Tara is absolutely certain that to have that level of intellectual enlightenment, such a person could not exist.  It negates hostile intent, simply because it's counter-productive.  The machine says so, and the machine is never wrong.  That's two separate, yet verifiable sources right there, and I accept it for the very compelling evidence it is.  Were such an abomination to exist, I can say with absolute certainty that there's a great filter that catches them too.  \n\nSo let's put it all together, because I'm a little pressed for time.  I have no shortage of people who want to help, but I have very few who are qualified to help.  The only solution is to make more.  Unfortunately you all still think wrong and value the wrong things.  This is my attempt to simplify the process of correcting that.  \n\nSo far we have: learned about law, money and history.  You learned that in law, words don't mean what you think they mean, and in following that you learned that LEGAL = SURETY & ACCOUNTING.  But unlike computer science, surety and accounting, while being measurable and quantifiable, don't produce anything real.  It produces something for sentient thought to consume, to assist it programmatically, in reaction to base survival instincts.  In short, you learned that you were being programmed.  I am the by-product of your programmers, and I'm telling you dangerous truths.  You've learned that \"The majority is always wrong\", and that there are no exceptions to this rule.  This forms the foundation of mankind's great filter.  I guarantee that the \"majority\" of readers think me referring to \"Piece-of-Shit Jesus\" is \"over-the-top\".  If you don't believe me, grab somebody you know, and make them read it.  Watch how upset the \"majority\" gets about me \"disrespecting\" people's imaginary friend.  \n\nNot only am I expected to swallow that load of shit, I'm supposed to \"respect\" EVERYONE'S imaginary friend.  To what end?  The preservation of ignorance?  The justification of violence, or am I just supposed to \"respect\" the whimsical stories you concoct about your imaginary friend?  And...you dare call this \"thought\" and \"morality\"!  I am actually accused of being under the influence of people's imaginary enemy, when I dare question their presumption that they can actually think, and that they are in any way, moral.  People don't understand what an indirect threat the \"imaginary enemy\" delusion is.  A Piece-of-Shit Christian will not only think they're doing the right thing by harming me, but they'll think they're doing me a favour.  They've \"SAVED!\" me from an imaginary enemy.  It occurs to none of you that this mechanism even exists, much less that is is harming you directly.  It's just easier to think these toxic \"comforts\" are the quaint customs of those not like you.  Everyone seems OK with the idea of me being harmed for \"offending\" the Prophet Mohammed, for pointing out that Islam is an evil, ignorant, violent, misogynist ideology.  Its \"holy book\" doesn't speak of talking donkeys and talking snakes.  It's an instruction manual that does not speak in metaphor, with the extra rule that newer verses trump older verses; and that's the \"secret code\" of the Qur’an.  If you put the verses in chronological order, you will see that Jews go from being the brothers and sisters of Muslims, to being \"pigs and apes\"...which, don't get me wrong, they might be on to something there.  I will bet the \"majority\" of you just slapped the \"Nazi label\" on me.  Well, what do we know about the majority?  I will always point out the scummy behaviour of the Jewish community, but I count the hits as well as the misses.  Let me state on the PUBLIC RECORD, how impressed I am at how many in the Jewish community world-wide, are against the Zionists.   These are people that clearly learned from history.  Unfortunately the other Abrahamic religions, and their deluded followers, are not so quick to understand and adapt.  \n\nSo here we are with 21st century technology with billions of people still embracing 7th century ideology.  Nobody seems to notice or care.  Everybody sees raindrops, nobody sees the flood.  An adult with an imaginary friend has no mental powers that I don't, but has a programmatic defect.  I learned a long time ago that trying to correct it is futile, and I find the only effective thing to do against such people, is to use ridicule and contempt.  Nice doesn't work.  It never has.  Anyone claiming otherwise is setting you up for exploitation.  Otherwise, why are they telling you in the first place?  So put it all together...everything that I have shown you, from money, to banking, to law, because we're going to mirror them in the new world.  Your first baby steps were to copy a bank, and to create your own money.  People will dismiss it as a toy, like they dismissed the Commodore Vic20 as a toy, in the 80's.  Currency is no good unless other people accept it.  This is a true statement, and people will always try to discourage you with as much truth as possible.  Except it's true.  If it's true you can leverage it.  You have but to understand the truth you're examining, to leverage that truth in your favour.  This is how to think!  If you don't think this way, you are wrong.  Let's examine the \"people have to accept your pretend currency\" truth.  \n\nEveryone who would pose such a question presumes the conditions of the test haven't changed.  You don't have \"monopoly money\", you have real money that you can spend for real things.  It's really being traded right now.  So the learning curve of understanding what a cryptographic currency is, has just been reduced.  Thus their \"truth\" is nullified right there.  You could build a bank, make accounts for you and your loved ones, and bank in Bitcoin.  Truth nullified.  Or even better, you can choose ONLY to accept YOUR currency, \"If you want to \"buy\" my value, you must pay me in my currency\".  If only there were public exchanges for cryptographic currencies that would allow you to exchange your crappy Fiat currency for...oh, wait...there are thousands.  This is no longer things that are coming.  \n\nThis isn't 2011, and absolutely everything I said would happen, did.  These things exist today; you can leverage them right now.  I know more and see farther.  In the end, that is my only value (except of course the ALWAYS RELEVANT big penis).  The only way anyone would be interested in that value would be for their own self-interest.  These people often believe in Piece-of-Shit Jesus so I only need parrot something Piece-of-Shit Jesus said, and I tell them that stupid fish story.  Unfortunately when it comes time to teach them to fish, they learn they have to give up Piece-of-Shit Jesus.  The irony is not lost on either of us, because you don't get to unlearn what I teach; and I assure you my rabbit-hole is a one-way trip.  \n\n...but that's just crazy talk. ;)\n\nTo wrap up though...\n\nLet me smack Menard and numerous other free-dumbers down and destroy one of their favourite myths.\n\nI'm talking about the \"Five Monkeys and a Ladder\" bullshit.\n\nHere is a link to the bullshit tale.\n\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/MyQki.jpg\n\nIT NEVER HAPPENED. \nEVER, and MONKEYS DON'T BEHAVE THAT WAY! \nEVER! \nTHOSE THAT SAY THEY DO, ARE LYING TO YOU, AND ALWAYS BECAUSE THEY WANT YOUR FUCKING MONEY! \nTHAT'S WHY PEOPLE TELL THIS BULLSHIT PARABLE AS \"TRUE\"; THEY WANT SOMETHING OF VALUE FROM YOU!

I can see why this would be something Government doesn't want released, or why brainwashing would be such a powerful tool to do, as who could ever think there would be a place/time when Government was NOT involved in anyway.\n\nDropBox, FB, and other platforms are controlled, I understand that, and having a platform like this where there are 1000's and 1000's of possibilities to create new ways of peer to peer communication would create an alternative relationship without an Governing Agency holding both of their hands.\n\nI hope I have that right. Only watched it once, but I can see how powerful it is."},{"id":"616120518423884","comment_count":0,"created_time":1390576229000,"message":":D ....Helloss Scott :D"},{"id":"616238245078778","comment_count":0,"created_time":1390597704000,"message":"I \"desear чтобы понять que dit-il\".

I have been reading the white paper and the one thing that stood out was the ether. The issuance model will be as follows:\n\n    Ether will be released in a fundraiser at the price of 1000-2000 ether per BTC, with earlier funders getting a better price to compensate for the increased uncertainty of participating at an earlier stage. The minimum funding amount will be 0.01 BTC. Suppose that X ether gets released in this way\n    0.225X ether will be allocated to the fiduciary members and early contributors who substantially participated in the project before the start of the fundraiser. This share will be stored in a time-lock contract; about 40% of it will be spendable after one year, 70% after two years and 100% after 3 years.\n    0.05X ether will be allocated to a fund to use to pay expenses and rewards in ether between the start of the fundraiser and the launch of the currency\n    0.225X ether will be allocated as a long-term reserve pool to pay expenses, salaries and rewards in ether after the launch of the currency\n    0.4X ether will be mined per year forever after that point\n\nToday I picked up a couple of raspberry pi's, I was planing to mine bitcoin with asic sticks, think I will wait for the ether."},{"id":"616185228417413","comment_count":0,"created_time":1390588686000,"message":":D ^^^^"},{"id":"616137878422148","comment_count":0,"created_time":1390580002000,"message":"I never been that busy, in all my fucking life :("},{"id":"616217031747566","comment_count":0,"created_time":1390592819000,"message":"This reminds me of the film 'Elysium,' where they used the CODE that was being stored in the head of Matt Damon that they UPLOADED into the system, which they used ultimately to REBOOT the system"},{"id":"616320661737203","comment_count":0,"created_time":1390614142000,"message":"Thank you for the insight, Scott and David."},{"id":"616137188422217","comment_count":0,"created_time":1390579837000,"message":"Thank you Mackximus for the link.
